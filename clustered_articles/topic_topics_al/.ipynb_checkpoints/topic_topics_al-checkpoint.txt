2311.15800v1.pdf	In order to uncover users' attitudes towards ChatGPT in mental health, this study examines public opinions about ChatGPT in mental health discussions on Reddit. Researchers used the bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment techniques for sentiment analysis and the BERTopic model for topic modeling. It was found that overall, negative sentiments prevail, followed by positive ones, with neutral sentiments being the least common. The prevalence of negative emotions has increased over time. Negative emotions encompass discussions on ChatGPT providing bad mental health advice, debates on machine vs. human value, the fear of AI, and concerns about Universal Basic Income (UBI). In contrast, positive emotions highlight ChatGPT's effectiveness in counseling, with mentions of keywords like "time" and "wallet." Neutral discussions center around private data concerns. These findings shed light on public attitudes toward ChatGPT in mental health, potentially contributing to the development of trustworthy AI in mental health from the public perspective.

Existing methods often retrieve evidences separately and then use a language model to generate an answer based on the retrieved evidences, and thus do not adequately connect candi- dates and are unable to model the interdependent relations during retrieval. Moreover, the pipelined approaches of retrieval and gen- eration might result in poor generation performance when retrieval performance is low. To address these issues, we propose a Structured Knowledge and Unified Retrieval-Generation (SKURG) approach. SKURG employs an Entity-centered Fusion Encoder to align sources from different modalities using shared entities. It then uses a unified Retrieval-Generation Decoder to integrate intermediate retrieval results for answer generation and also adaptively determine the number of retrieval steps. Extensive experiments on two representa- tive multi-modal multi-hop QA datasets MultimodalQA and WebQA demonstrate that SKURG outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both source retrieval and answer generation performance with fewer parameters1.

2022.constraint-1.8.pdf	During the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of misinformation on online social media has grown exponentially. Unverified bogus claims on these platforms regularly mislead people, leading them to believe in half-baked truths. The current vogue is to employ man- ual fact-checkers to verify claims to combat this avalanche of misinformation. However, establishing such claims’ veracity is becom- ing increasingly challenging, partly due to the plethora of information available, which is dif- ficult to process manually. Thus, it becomes imperative to verify claims automatically with- out human interventions. To cope up with this issue, we propose an automated claim verification solution encompassing two steps – document retrieval and veracity prediction. For the retrieval module, we employ a hybrid search-based system with BM25 as a base re- triever and experiment with recent state-of-the- art transformer-based models for re-ranking. Furthermore, we use a BART-based textual entailment architecture to authenticate the re- trieved documents in the later step. We report experimental findings, demonstrating that our retrieval module outperforms the best baseline system by 10.32 NDCG@100 points. We es- cort a demonstration to assess the efficacy and impact of our suggested solution. As a byprod- uct of this study, we present an open-source, easily deployable, and user-friendly Python API that the community can adopt.

To combat that, we propose a novel frame- work that simultaneously implements the idea of internal-information screening and external- information exploiting. First, we represent the fine-grained semantic structures of the input im- age and text with the visual and textual scene graphs, which are further fused into a unified cross-modal graph (CMG). Based on CMG, we perform structure refinement with the guid- ance of the graph information bottleneck prin- ciple, actively denoising the less-informative features. Next, we perform topic modeling over the input image and text, incorporating latent multimodal topic features to enrich the contexts. On the benchmark MRE dataset, our system outperforms the current best model significantly. With further in-depth analyses, we reveal the great potential of our method for the MRE task. Our codes are open at

2311.01449v2.pdf	Topic modeling is a well-established technique for exploring text corpora. Conventional topic models (e.g., LDA) represent topics as bags of words that often require “reading the tea leaves” to interpret; additionally, they offer users mini- mal control over the formatting and specificity of resulting topics. To tackle these issues, we in- troduce TopicGPT, a prompt-based framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to un- cover latent topics in a text collection. Top- icGPT produces topics that align better with human categorizations compared to competing

2310.08975v3.pdf	Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language questions over large-scale knowledge bases (KBs), which can be summarized into two crucial steps: knowledge retrieval and semantic parsing. However, three core challenges remain: in- efficient knowledge retrieval, mistakes of re- trieval adversely impacting semantic parsing, and the complexity of previous KBQA meth- ods. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ChatKBQA, a novel and simple generate-then- retrieve KBQA framework, which proposes first generating the logical form with fine- tuned LLMs, then retrieving and replacing en- tities and relations with an unsupervised re- trieval method, to improve both generation and retrieval more directly. Experimental re- sults show that ChatKBQA achieves new state- of-the-art performance on standard KBQA datasets, WebQSP, and CWQ. This work can also be regarded as a new paradigm for combin- ing LLMs with knowledge graphs (KGs) for in- terpretable and knowledge-required question answering. Our code is publicly available1.

2305.01750v2.pdf	Question answering over knowledge bases is considered a difﬁcult problem due to the chal- lenge of generalizing to a wide variety of pos- sible natural language questions. Additionally, the heterogeneity of knowledge base schema items between different knowledge bases often necessitates specialized training for different knowledge base question-answering (KBQA) datasets. To handle questions over diverse KBQA datasets with a uniﬁed training-free framework, we propose KB-BINDER, which for the ﬁrst time enables few-shot in-context learning over KBQA tasks. Firstly, KB- BINDER leverages large language models like Codex to generate logical forms as the draft for a speciﬁc question by imitating a few demon- strations. Secondly, KB-BINDER grounds on the knowledge base to bind the generated draft to an executable one with BM25 score match- ing. The experimental results on four public heterogeneous KBQA datasets show that KB- BINDER can achieve a strong performance with only a few in-context demonstrations. Es- pecially on GraphQA and 3-hop MetaQA, KB- BINDER can even outperform the state-of-the- art trained models. On GrailQA and WebQSP, our model is also on par with other fully- trained models. We believe KB-BINDER can serve as an important baseline for future re- search. Our code is available at https:// github.com/ltl3A87/KB-BINDER

This social media generated information comes in the form of tweets or posts, and nor- mally characterized as short text, huge, sparse, and low density. Since many real-world applications need semantic interpretation of such short texts, research in Short Text Topic Modeling (STTM) has recently gained a lot of interest to reveal unique and cohesive latent topics. This article examines the current state of the art in STTM algorithms. It presents a comprehensive survey and taxonomy of STTM algorithms for short text topic modelling. The article also includes a qualitative and quantitative study of the STTM algorithms, as well as analyses of the various strengths and drawbacks of STTM techniques. Moreover, a comparative analysis of the topic quality and performance of representative STTM models is presented. The performance evaluation is conducted on two real-world Twitter datasets: the Real-World Pandemic Twitter (RW-Pand-Twitter) dataset and Real-world Cyberbully- ing Twitter (RW-CB-Twitter) dataset in terms of several metrics such as topic coherence, purity, NMI, and accuracy. Finally, the open challenges and future research directions in this promising field are discussed to highlight the trends of research in STTM.

The approach is vital for service industries to monitor their customer discussions. The use of traditional approaches such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic discovery has shown great performances, however, they are not consistent in their results as these approaches suffer from data sparseness and inability to model the word order in a document. Thus, this study presents the use of Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KernelPCA) and K-means Clustering in the BERTopic architecture. We have prepared a new dataset using tweets from customers of Nigerian banks and we use this to compare the topic modelling approaches. Our ﬁndings showed KernelPCA and K-means in the BERTopic architecture-produced coherent topics with a coherence score of 0.8463. language processing; banking industry; Nigeria Pidgin English

2408.04216v1.pdf	—This paper advances a novel architectural schema anchored upon the Transformer paradigm and innovatively amalgamates the K-means categorization algorithm to augment the contextual apprehension capabilities of the schema. The transformer model performs well in machine translation tasks due to its parallel computing power and multi-head attention mechanism. However, it may encounter contextual ambiguity or ignore local features when dealing with highly complex language structures. To circumvent this constraint, this exposition incorporates the K-Means algorithm, which is used to stratify the lexis and idioms of the input textual matter, thereby facilitating superior identification and preservation of the local structure and contextual intelligence of the language. The advantage of this combination is that K-Means can automatically discover the topic or concept regions in the text, which may be directly related to translation quality. Consequently, the schema contrived herein enlists K-Means as a preparatory phase antecedent to the Transformer and recalibrates the multi-head attention weights to assist in the discrimination of lexis and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities. This ensures the schema accords heightened regard to the contextual intelligence embodied by these clusters during the training phase, rather than merely focusing on locational intelligence. Keywords—Transformer; Text mining; Machine translation; K-Means I. INTRODUCTION This paper aims to explore an innovative approach to improve context modeling and understanding in the text mining and machine translation domains by combining the Transformer architecture with the K-Means clustering algorithm. The Transformer paradigm has risen to dominance in the realm of machine translation since its inception, primarily due to its exceptional parallel processing capabilities and multi- head attention mechanism. This architecture enables the model to process the entire input sequence simultaneously, significantly enhancing processing speed and improving translation accuracy. However, despite its proficiency in managing long-range dependencies, the Transformer model may sometimes overlook local features, resulting in contextual ambiguity or inaccurate translations, especially when dealing with technical terminology or culturally specific expressions. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, this discourse introduces an innovative architectural construct denominated as the k-Transformer, which amalgamates the K-Means cluster analysis algorithm into the Transformer framework to augment the context-sensitive acumen of the model. The k- Transformer operates by leveraging the K-Means algorithm to aggregate the input textual data, pinpointing and safeguarding the local configuration of lexemes and idioms bearing analogous semantics or functionalities before model training. This preparatory phase empowers the model to discern thematic or conceptual domains within the textual content more effectively, thereby focusing increased attention on the contextual nuances of these domains during the translation operation. The K-Means algorithm is an unsupervised learning technique, proficient in autonomously unveiling the inherent structure embedded within the dataset. Within the k- Transformer construct, K-Means is harnessed to categorize the input textual matter at the lexical and idiomatic levels, amalgamating similar entities together. Consequently, the model apprehends essential conceptual territories even within extended textual sequences, avoiding sole reliance on positional indices for attention distribution. This refined attention mechanism enables the model to translate textual matter encompassing intricate contexts and specialized nomenclature with greater precision, thereby elevating the overall quality of the translation. The conventional evaluative metric, the BLEU score, is employed to quantify the translation fidelity and preservation of contextual integrity in the experimental setting. The K-Transformer framework proposed in this paper brings new possibilities to the field of machine translation and text mining by fusing the Transformer architecture and the K- Means clustering algorithm. This method not only improves the model's ability to understand complex contexts, but also enhances the accuracy and fluency of translation. The K- Transformer framework is highly beneficial across several fields, particularly in enhancing natural language processing applications. It can significantly improve machine translation, information retrieval, and sentiment analysis, facilitating deeper understanding and generation of text. Furthermore, it's useful in developing financial risk management and multi-scale image recognition, and for document summarization tasks, aiding in efficient information extraction. Additionally, in healthcare, K- Transformers can assist in interpreting medical texts, supporting diagnostic and treatment processes, and enriching medical research literature analysis. This versatility makes K- Transformers valuable in any sector where advanced language comprehension is required. II.

TRANSFORMER MODEL WITH SELF-ATTENTION MECHANISM The core component of the Transformer is its encoder module, which is composed of a series of stacked encoder layers with a consistent architecture. Embedded in each layer are two key components: Multi-head Attention and a fully connected feedforward neural network. The model architecture is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Transformer Model Architecture In order to ensure that the model can still learn effectively when the depth is increased, the designer cleverly adds a residual connection strategy between the sub-layers, which not only helps to alleviate the problem of gradient disappearance, but also further optimizes the gradient propagation path through the subsequent Layer Normalization operation, which significantly accelerates the training convergence of the model. As shown in Equation 1. layernorm(ℎ+ sublayer(ℎ)) Where layernorm(·) signifies the output of the layer regularization function, and sublayer(·) represents the emanation of the sublayer; h is the symbolic representation of the covert status of the sublayer input. The decoder is fabricated from a tier of n congruent decoder strata. Contrasted against the encoder, the decoder integrates an encoder-decoder cross-attention subsidiary stratum to amalgamate the data from both the encoder and the decoder. Once more, a residual linkage is employed betwixt each dyad of subsidiary strata, succeeded by a stratum of normalization operation. The foundational component of the multi-headed scrutiny within the encoder and decoder subsidiary strata of the Transformer is the Scaled Dot-product scrutiny, which ingests the query matrix Q alongside the key- value duet matrices K and V as ingress. The conditioning procedure of the dot product scrutiny mechanism unfolds as follows. Post the embedding of lexical units and positional indicators, the originating sentence acquires the ingress sequence 𝑋= (𝑥1, 𝑥2, . . . , 𝑥𝑛) ∈ℝ𝑑𝑥. We delineate trio matrices: 𝑊𝑜,𝑊𝐾,𝑊𝑉 utilizing these matrices for respective linear transformations of the ingress sequence, and thenceforth engendering trio neoteric vectors: 𝑞𝑡,𝑘𝑡,𝑣𝑡. Concatenate all 𝑞𝑡 vectors into a voluminous matrix, denominated as the query matrix Q; concatenate all 𝑘𝑡 vectors into a voluminous matrix, denominated as the key matrix K; and concatenate all 𝑣𝑡 vectors into a voluminous matrix, denominated as the value matrix V. The scrutiny weight of the inaugural lexical unit is procured by multiplying the query vector 𝑞1 of the inaugural lexical unit with the key matrix K. Subsequently, we necessitate the application of a softmax function to the values to ensure their summation equals unity. The output of the inaugural lexical unit is attained by multiplying each weight by the weighted aggregation of the value vector 𝑣𝑡 of the corresponding lexical unit. Continuation of the aforementioned operations upon the sequential ingress vectors yields all outputs subsequent to traversing the dot product scrutiny mechanism, as delineated in Equation 2. Attention(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = softmax (𝑄𝐾𝑇 √𝑑𝑘 ) 𝑉 Ultimately, the polycephalous attention mechanism synthesizes the outcomes of numerous dot product scrutiny operations to attain the terminal output: ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖= Attention(𝑄𝑊𝑄, 𝐾𝑊𝐾, 𝑉𝑊𝑉) MultiHead(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = Concat(ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖)𝑊𝑜 Where: 𝑊𝑄 ,𝑊𝐾, 𝑊𝑉, 𝑊𝑜 are parameter matrices. ℎ𝑒𝑎𝑑𝑖 is the output vector of the ith attention head. The feedforward neural network is a fully connected network layer between two layers, and RELU is used as the activation function, as shown in Equation 5. FFN(𝑥) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝑥𝑾1 + 𝑏1)𝑾2 + 𝑏2 Here, 𝑾1, 𝑾2, 𝑏1, 𝑏2 are the model parameters. Owing to the fact that the Transformer lacks recurrent and convolutional neural architectures, it operates upon each term within the sentence concurrently and is devoid of the capacity to discern the sequential arrangement of individual terms. Incorporating positional encoding serves to aid the transference paradigm in recognizing the locational metadata associated with terms within the sentence. The magnitude of the positional encoding aligns identically with the dimensionality of the term vector, and the amalgamation of these can subsequently serve as the ingress sequence. The Transformer employs trigonometric sine and cosine functions, characterized by varying periodicity, to calculate the positional encoding, as delineated in Equations 6 and 7.
