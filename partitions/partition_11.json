Part of that trust\ncomes from a deep commitment to protecting the confidentiality of\nparticipants. We have changed names and identifying details to protect\nparticipants\u2019 confidentiality. All quotes in the book , however, are either\nverbatim or based on actual study interviews, audiotapes, observations, and\nother data.\n  1  \nWHAT MAKES A GOOD LIFE?\nThere isn\u2019t time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies,\nheartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but\nan instant, so to speak, for that.\nMark Twain\nLet\u2019s begin with a question:\nIf you had to make one life choice, right now, to set yourself on the path\nto future health and happiness, what would it be?\nWould you choose to put more money into savings each month? To change\ncareers? Would you decide to travel more? What single choice could best\nensure that when you reach your final days and look back, you\u2019ll feel that\nyou\u2019ve lived a good l ife?\nIn a 2007 survey, millennials were asked about their most important life\ngoals. Seventy-six percent said that becoming rich was their number one\ngoal. Fifty percent said a major goal was to become famous. More than a\ndecade later, after millennials had spent more time as adults, similar\nquestions were asked again in a pair of surveys. Fame was now lower on the\nlist, but the top goals again included things like making money, having a\nsuccessful career, and becoming debt-free.\nThese are common and practical goals that extend across generations and\nborders. In many countries, from the time they are barely old enough to\nspeak, children are asked what they want to be when they grow up\u2014that is,\nwhat careers they intend to pursue. When adults meet new people, one of the\nfirst questions asked is, \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Success in life is often measured\nby title, salary, and recognition of achievement, even though most of us\nunderstand that these things do not necessarily make for a happy life on their\nown. Those who manage to check off some or even all of the desired boxes\noften find themselves on the other side feeling much the same as before.\nMeanwhile, all day long we\u2019re bombarded with messages about what\nwill make us happy, about what we should want in our lives, about who is\ndoing life \u201cright.\u201d Ads tell us that eating this brand of yogurt will make us\nhealthy, buying that smartphone will bring new joy to our lives, and using a\nspecial face cream will keep us young forever.\nOther messages are less explicit, woven into the fabric of daily living. If\na friend buys a new car, we might wonder if a newer car would make our\nown life better. As we scroll social media feeds seeing only pictures of\nfantastic parties and sandy beaches, we might wonder if our own life is\nlacking in parties, lacking in beaches. In our casual friendships, at work, and\nespecially on social media, we tend to show each other idealized versions of\nourselves. We present our game faces, and the comparison between what we\nsee of each other and how we feel about ourselves leaves us with the sense\nthat we\u2019re missing out. As an old saying goes, We are always comparing our\ninsides to other people\u2019s outsides.\nOver time we develop the subtle but hard-to-shake feeling that our life is\nhere, now, and the things we need for a good life are over there, or in the\nfuture. Always just out of reach.\nLooking at life through this lens, it\u2019s easy to believe that the good life\ndoesn\u2019t really exist, or else that it\u2019s only possible for others. Our own life,\nafter all, rarely matches the picture we\u2019ve created in our heads of what a\ngood life should look like. Our own life is always too messy, too\ncomplicated to be good.\nSpoiler alert: The good l ife is a complicated life. For everybody .\nThe good life is joyful\u2026 and challenging. Full of love, but also pain.\nAnd it never strictly happe ns; instead, the good life unfolds, through time. It\nis a process. It includes turmoil, calm, lightness, burdens, struggles,\nachievements, setbacks, leaps forward, and terrible falls. And of course, the\ngood l ife always ends in death.\nA cheery sales pitch, we know.\nBut let\u2019s not mince words. Life, even when it\u2019s good, is not easy. There is\nsimply no way to make life perfect, and if there were, then it wouldn\u2019t be\ngood.\nWhy? Because a rich life\u2014a good life\u2014is forged from precisely the\nthings that make it hard.\nThis book is built on a bedrock of scientific research. At its heart is the\nHarvard Study of Adult Development, an extraordinary scientific endeavor\nthat began in 1938, and against all odds  is still going strong today. Bob is the\nfourth director of the Study, and Marc its associate director. Radical for its\ntime, the Study set out to understand human health by investigating not what\nmade people sick, but what made them thrive. It has recorded the experience\nof its participants\u2019 lives more or less as they were happening, from\nchildhood troubles, to first loves, to final days. Like the lives of its\nparticipants, the Harvard Study\u2019s road has itself been long and winding,\nevolving in its methods over the decades and expanding to now include three\ngenerations and more than 1,300 of the descendants of its original 724\nparticipants. It continues to evolve and expand today, and is the longest in-\ndepth longitudinal study of human life ever done.\nBut no single study, no matter how rich, is enough to permit broad claims\nabout human life. So while this book  stands directly on the foundation of the\nHarvard Study, it is supported on all sides by hundreds of other scientific\nstudies involving many thousands of people from all over the world. The\nbook  is also threaded with wisdom from the recent and ancient past\u2014\nenduring ideas that mirror and enrich modern scientific understandings of the\nhuman experience. It is a book  primarily about the power of relationships,\nand it is deeply informed, appropriately, by the long and fruitful friendship of\nits authors.\nBut the book  would not exist without the human beings who took part in\nthe Harvard Study\u2019s research\u2014whose honesty and generosity made this\nunlikely study possible in the first place.\nPeople like Rosa and Henry Keane.\n\u201cWhat is your greatest fear?\u201d\nRosa read the question out loud and then looked across the kitchen table\nat her husband, Henry. Now in their 70s, Rosa and Henry had lived in this\nhouse and sat at this same table together on most mornings for more than fifty\nyears. Between them sat a pot of tea, an open pack of Oreos (half eaten), and\nan audio recorder. In the corner of the room, a video camera. Next to the\nvideo camera sat a young Harvard researcher named Charlotte, quietly\nobserving and taking notes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite the question,\u201d Rosa said.\n\u201cMy greatest fear?\u201d Henry said to Charlotte. \u201cOr our greatest fear?\u201d\nRosa and Henry didn\u2019t think of themselves as particularly interesting\nsubjects for a study. They\u2019d both grown up poor, married in their 20s, and\nraised five kids together. They\u2019d lived through the Great Depression and\nplenty of hard times, sure, but that was no different from anyone else they\nknew. So they never understood why Harvard researchers were interested in\nthe first place, let alone why they were still interested, still calling, still\nsending questionnaires, and occasionally still flying across the country to\nvisit.\nHenry was only 14 years old and living in Boston\u2019s West End, in a\ntenement with no running water, when researchers from the Study first\nknocked on his family\u2019s door and asked his perplexed parents if they could\nmake a record of his life. The Study was in full swing when he married Rosa\nin August of 1954\u2014the records show that when she said yes to his propos al,\nHenry couldn\u2019t believe his luck\u2014and now here they were in October of\n2004, two months after their fiftieth wedding anniversary. Rosa had been\nasked to participate more directly in the Study in 2002. It\u2019s about  time, she\nsaid. Harvard had been tracking Henry year after year since 1941. Rosa often\nsaid she thought it was odd that he still agreed to be involved as an older\nman, because he was so private otherwise. But Henry said he felt a sense of\nduty to participate and had also developed an appreciation for the process\nbecause it gave him perspective on things. So, for sixty-three years he had\nopened his life to the research team. In fact, he\u2019d told them so much about\nhimself, and for so long, that he couldn\u2019t even remember what they did and\ndidn\u2019t know. But he assumed they knew everything, including certain things\nhe\u2019d never told anyone but Rosa, because whenever they asked a question he\ndid his best to tell them the truth.\nAnd they asked a lot of questions.\n\u201cMr. Keane was clearly flattered that I had come to Grand Rapids to\ninterview them,\u201d Charlotte would write in her field notes, \u201cand this set a\nfriendly atmosphere for the interview. I found him to be a cooperative and\ninterested person. He was thoughtful about each answer, and often paused for\na few moments before he responded. He was friendly though, and I felt that\nhe was like the stereotype of the quiet man from Michigan.\u201d\nCharlotte was there for a two-day visit to interview the Keanes and\nadminister a survey\u2014a very long survey\u2014of questions about their health,\ntheir individual lives, and their life together. Like most of our young\nresearchers embarking on new careers, Charlotte had her own questions\nabout what makes a good life and about how her current choices might affect\nher future. Was it possible that insights about her own life could be locked\naway in the lives of others? The only way to find out was to ask questions,\nand to be deeply attentive to every person she interviewed. What was\nimportant to this particular individual? What gave their days meaning? What\nhad they learned from their experiences? What did they regret? Every\ninterview presented Charlotte with new oppor tunities to connect with a\nperson whose life was further along than her own, and who came from\ndifferent circumstances and a different moment in history.\nToday she would interview Henry and Rosa together, administer the\nsurvey, and then videotape them talking together about their greatest fears.\nShe would also interview them separately in what we call \u201cattachment\ninterviews.\u201d Back in Boston the videotapes and interview transcripts would\nbe studied so that the way Henry and Rosa talked about each other, their\nnonverbal cues, and many other bits of information could be coded into data\non the nature of their bond\u2014da ta that would become part of their files and\none small but important piece of a giant dataset on what a lived life is\nactually like.\nWhat is your greatest fear? Charlotte had already recorded their\nindividual answers to this question in separate interviews, but now it was\ntime to discuss the question with each other.\nThe discussion went like this:\n\u201cI like the hard questions in a certain way,\u201d Rosa said.\n\u201cWell good,\u201d  Henry said. \u201cYou go first.\u201d\nRosa was quiet for a moment and then told Henry her greatest fear was\nthat he might develop a serious health condition, or that she would have\nanother stroke. Henry agreed that those were scary possibilities. But, he said,\nthey were getting to a point now where something like that was probably\ninevitable. They spoke at length about how a serious illness might affect their\nadult children\u2019s lives, and each other. Eventually Rosa admitted that there\nwas only so much a person could anticipate, and there was no use in getting\nupset before it happened.\n\u201cIs there another question?\u201d Henry asked Charlotte.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your greatest fear, Hank?\u201d Rosa said.\n\u201cI was hoping you would forget to ask me,\u201d Henry said, and they laughed.\nHenry poured more tea for Rosa, took another Oreo for himself, and then was\nquiet for some time.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hard one to answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not something I like to\nthink about, to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cWell they sent this poor girl all the way from Boston, so you better\nanswer.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s ugly, I guess,\u201d he said, his voice wavering.\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\u201cThat I won\u2019t die first is my fear. That I\u2019ll be left here without you.\u201d\nAt the corner of Bulfinch Triangle in Boston\u2019s West End, not far from\nwhere Henry Keane lived as a child, the Lockhart Building overlooks the\nnoisy convergence of Merrimac and Causeway Streets. In the early twentieth\ncentury this stubborn brick structure was a furniture factory, and employed\nmen and women from Henry\u2019s neighborhood. Now it\u2019s home to medical\noffices, a local pizzeria, and a donut shop. It\u2019s also home to the researchers\nand the records of the Harvard Study of Adult Development, the longest study\nof adult life ever conducted.\nNestled near the back of a file drawer labeled \u201cKA\u2013KE\u201d are Henry\u2019s and\nRosa\u2019s files. Inside we find the yellowed pages, crumbling at the edges, of\nHenry\u2019s 1941 intake interview. It is written in longhand, in the interviewer\u2019s\nflowing, practiced cursive. We see that his family was among the poorest in\nBoston, that at age 14 Henry was seen as a \u201cstable, well-controlled\u201d\nadolescent, with \u201ca logical regard for his future.\u201d We can see that as a young\nadult he was very close to his mother, but resented his father, whose\nalcoholism forced Henry to be the primary breadwinner. In one particularly\ndamaging incident when Henry was in his 20s, his father told Henry\u2019s new\nfianc\u00e9e that her $300 engagement ring had deprived the family of needed\nmoney. Fearing she would never escape his family, his fianc\u00e9e called off the\nengagement.\nIn 1953 Henry broke free of his father when he got a job with General\nMotors and moved to Willow Run, Michigan. There he met Rosa, a Danish\nimmigrant and one of nine children. One year later they were married and\nwould go on to have five children of their own. \u201cPlenty, but not enough,\u201d in\nRosa\u2019s opinion.\nOver the next decade Henry and Rosa would experience some difficult\ntimes. In 1959 their five-year-old son, Robert, contracted polio, a challenge\nthat tested their marriage and caused a great deal of pain and worry in the\nfamily. Henry began at GM on the factory floor as an assembler, but after\nmissing work due to Robert\u2019s illness he was demoted, then laid off, and at\none point found himself unemployed with three children to care for. To make\nends meet, Rosa began working for the city of Willow Run, in the payroll\ndepartment. While the job was initially a stopgap for the family, Rosa\nbecame much loved by her coworkers, and she worked full-time there for the\nnext thirty years, developing relationships with people she came to think of\nas her second family. After being laid off Henry changed careers three times,\nfinally returning to GM in 1963, and working his way up to floor supervisor.\nShortly after, he reconnected with his father (who had managed to overcome\nhis addiction to alcohol) and forgave him.\nHenry and Rosa\u2019s daughter, Peggy, now in her 50s, is also a participant in\nthe Study. Peggy does not know what her parents have shared with the Study\nbecause we do not want to bias her reports about her family life. Having\nmultiple perspectives on the same family environment and the same events\nhelps broaden and deepen the Study\u2019s data. When we dig into Peggy\u2019s file,\nwe learn that when she was growing up, she felt her parents understood her\nproblems, and that they helped cheer her up when she was upset. In general,\nshe saw her parents as \u201cvery affectionate.\u201d And consistent with Henry\u2019s and\nRosa\u2019s own reports about their marriage, Peggy said that her parents never\nconsidered separation or divorce.\nIn 1977, a t age 50, H enry rated his life this way:\nEnjoyment of marriage: EXCELLENT\nMood ov er the past year: EXCELLENT\nPhysical health over the past 2 years: EXCELLENT.\nBut we don\u2019t determine Henry\u2019s health and happiness, or anyone\u2019s in the\nStudy, simply by asking them and their loved ones how they feel. Study\nparticipants allow us to look at their well-being through many different\nlenses, including everything from brain scans to blood tests to videotapes of\nthem talking about their deepest concerns. We take samples of their hair to\nmeasure stress hormones, we ask them to describe their biggest worries and\ntheir critical goals in life, and we measure how quickly their heart rates calm\ndown after we challenge them with brain teasers. This information gives us a\ndeeper and fuller measurement of how someone is doing in their life.\nHenry was a shy man, but he devoted himself to his closest relationships,\nin particular to his connection with Rosa and his children, and these\nconnections provided him with a deep sense of security. He also employed\ncertain powerful coping mechanisms that we will discuss in the coming\npages. Building on this combination of emotional security and effective\ncoping, Henry could report over and over again that he was \u201chappy\u201d or \u201cvery\nhappy,\u201d even during his hardest times, and his health and longevity reflect\nthat.\nIn 2009, five years after Charlotte\u2019s visit to Henry and Rosa\u2019s home, and\nseventy-one years after his first interview with the Study, Henry\u2019s greatest\nfear came true: Rosa passed away. Less than six weeks later, Henry\nfollowed.\nBut the family legacy continues in their daughter, Peggy. Just recently, she\nsat down for an interview at our offices in Boston. Since the age of 29 Peggy\nhas been in a happy relationship with her partner, Susan, and now, at age 57,\nreports no loneliness and good health. She is a respected grade school\nteacher and an active member of her community. But the path she took to\narrive at this happy time in her life is harrowing and courageous, and we\u2019ll\nbe returning to her later.\nTHE INVESTMENT OF A LIFETIME\nWhat was it about Henry and Rosa\u2019s approach to life that allowed them\nto flourish in the face of difficulty? And what makes Henry and Rosa\u2019s story,\nor any of the life stories in the Harvard Study, worth your time and attention?\nWhen it comes to understanding what happens to people as they go\nthrough life, pictures of entire lives\u2014of the choices people make and the\npaths they follow, and how it all works out for them\u2014are almost impossible\nto get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people\nto remember the past, and memories are full of holes. Just try to remember\nwhat you had for dinner last Tuesday, or who you spoke with on this date last\nyear, and you\u2019ll get an idea how much of our lives is lost to memory. The\nmore time that passes, the more details we forget, and research shows that\nthe act of recalling an event can actually change our memory of it. In short, as\na tool for studying past events, the human memory is at its best imprecise,\nand at its worst, inventive.\nBut what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time?\nWhat if we could study people from the time that they were teenagers all the\nway into old age to see what really matters to a person\u2019s health and\nhappiness, and which investments really paid off?\nWe did that.\nFor eighty-four years (and counting), the Harvard Study has tracked the\nsame individuals, asking thousands of questions and taking hundreds of\nmeasurements to find out what really keeps people healthy and happy.\nThrough all the years of studying these lives, one crucial factor stands out for\nthe consistency and power of its ties to physical health, mental health, and\nlongevity. Contrary to what many people might think, it\u2019s not career\nachievement, or exercise, or a healthy diet. Don\u2019t get us wrong; these things\nmatter (a lot). But one thing continuously demonstrates its broad and enduring\nimportance:\nGood r elationships.\nIn fact, good relationships are significant enough that if we had to take all\neighty-four years of the Harvard Study and boil it down to a single principle\nfor living, one life investment that is supported by similar findings across a\nwide variety of other studies, it would be this:\nGood r elationships keep us healthier and happi er. Period.\nSo if you\u2019re going to make that one choice, that single decision that could\nbest ensure your own health and happiness, science tells us that your choice\nshould be to cultivate warm relationships. Of all kinds. As we\u2019ll show you,\nit\u2019s not a choice that you make only once, but over and over again, second by\nsecond, week by week, and year by year. It\u2019s a choice that has been found in\none study after another to contribute to enduring joy and flourishing lives. But\nit\u2019s not always an easy one to make. As human beings, even with the best\nintentions, we get in our own way, make mistakes, and get hurt by the people\nwe love. The path to the good life, after all, isn\u2019t easy, but successfully\nnavigating its twists and turns is entirely possible. The Harvard Study of\nAdult Development can point the way.\nA TREASURE IN BOSTON\u2019S WEST END\nThe Harvard Study of Adult Development began in Boston when the\nUnited States was fighting its way out of the Great Depression. As New Deal\nprojects like Social Security and unemployment insurance gained momentum,\nthere was a growing interest in understanding what factors made human\nbeings thrive, as oppos ed to what factors made them fail. This new interest\nled two unrelated groups of researchers in Boston to initiate research\nprojects closely following two very different groups of boys.\nThe first was a group of 268 sophomores at Harvard College, selected\nbecause they were deemed likely to grow into healthy and well-adjusted\nmen. In the spirit of the time, but well ahead of his contemporaries in the\nmedical community, Arlie Bock, Harvard\u2019s new professor of hygiene and\nchief of Student Health Services, wanted to move away from a research\nfocus on what made people sick to a focus on what made people healthy. At\nleast half of the young men chosen for the study were able to attend Harvard\nonly with the aid of scholarships and by holding down jobs to help pay\ntuition, and some came from well-to-do families. Some could trace their\nroots in America to the founding of the country, and 13 percent of them had\nparents who had immigrated to the U.S.\nThe second was a group of 456 inner-city Boston boys like Henry Keane,\nselected for a different reason: they were children who grew up in some of\nBoston\u2019s most troubled families and most disadvantaged neighborhoods , but\nwho, at age 14, had mostly succeeded in avoiding the paths to juvenile\ndelinquency that some of their peers were following. More than 60 pe rcent of\nthese adolescents had at least one parent who immigrated to the U.S., most\nfrom poor areas of Eastern and Western Europe and areas in or near the\nMiddle East, such as Greater Syria and Turkey. Their modest roots and\nimmigrant status made them doubly marginalized. Sheldon and Eleanor\nGlueck, a lawyer and a social worker, respectively, initiated this study in an\nattempt to understand which life factors prevented delinquency, and these\nboys had succeeded on that front.\nThese two studies began separately and with their own aims, but were\nlater merged, and now operate under the same banner.\nWhen they joined their respective studies, all of the inner-city and\nHarvard participants were interviewed. They were given medical exams.\nResearchers went to their homes and interviewed their parents. And then\nthese teenagers grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They\nbecame factory workers and lawyers and bricklayers and doctors. Some\ndeveloped alcoholism. A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the\nsocial ladder from the bottom all the way to the very top, and some made that\njourney in the oppos ite direction.\nThe founders of the Harvard Study would be shocked and delighted to\nsee that it still continues today, generating unique and important findings they\ncouldn\u2019t have imagined. And as the current director (Bob) and associate\ndirector (Marc), we are incredibly proud to bring some of these findings to\nyou.\nA LENS THAT CAN SEE THROUGH TIME\nHuman beings are full of surprises and contradictions. We don\u2019t always\nmake sense, even (or maybe especially) to ourselves. The Harvard Study\ngives us a unique and practical tool to see through some of this natural human\nmystery. Some quick scientific context will help explain why.\nStudies of human health and behavior generally come in two flavors:\n\u201ccross-sectional\u201d and \u201clongitudinal.\u201d Cross-sectional studies take a slice out\nof the world at a given moment and look inside, much the way you might cut\ninto a layer cake to see what it\u2019s made of. Most psychological and health\nstudies fall into this category because they are cost efficient to conduct. They\ntake a finite amount of time and have predictable costs. But they have a\nfundamental limitation, which Bob likes to illustrate with the old joke that if\nyou relied only on cross-sectional surveys, you\u2019d have to conclude that there\nare people in Miami who are born Cuban and die Jewish. In other words,\ncross-sectional studies are \u201csnapshots\u201d of life, and can prompt us to see\nconnections between two unconnected things because they omit one crucial\nvariable: time.\nLongitudinal studies, on the other hand, are what they sound like. Long.\nThey examine lives through  time. There are two ways to do this. The first\nwe\u2019ve already mentioned, and it\u2019s the most common: you ask people to\nremember the past. This is known as a retrospective study.\nBut as we mentioned, these studies rely on memory. Take Henry and\nRosa. During their individual interviews in 2004, Charlotte asked each of\nthem, separately, to describe the first time they met. Rosa recounted how\nshe\u2019d slipped on the ice in front of Henry\u2019s truck, how Henry helped her up,\nand how she later saw him in a restaurant when she was out with some of her\nfriends.\n\u201cIt was funny, and we had a laugh about it,\u201d Rosa said, \u201cbecause he was\nwearing two different colors of socks, and I thought, \u2018Boy he\u2019s in bad shape,\nhe needs somebody  like me!\u2019\u200a\u201d\nHenry also remembered Rosa slipping on the ice.\n\u201cThen I saw her sitting in a caf\u00e9 sometime later,\u201d he said, \u201cand she caught\nme staring at her legs. But I was only looking because she was wearing two\ndifferent colors of stockings, red and black.\u201d\nThis kind of disagreement among couples is common, and probably\nfamiliar to anyone who\u2019s been in a long-term relationship. Well, anytime you\nand your partner disagree about the facts of your life together, you are\nwitnessing the failure of a retrospective study.\nThe Harvard Study is not retrospective, it is prospective. Our\nparticipants are asked about their life as it is, not as it was. As in Henry and\nRosa\u2019s case, we do sometimes ask about the past in order to study the nature\nof memory, how events are processed and remembered in the future, but in\ngeneral we want to know about the present. In this case, we actually know\nwhose version of the socks/stockings story is more correct, because we\nasked Henry the same question about meeting Rosa the year they got married.\n\u201cI was wearing different color socks, and she noticed,\u201d he said in 1954.\n\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t let that happen today.\u201d\nProspective, life-spanning studies like this are exceedingly rare.\nParticipants drop out, change their names, or move without notifying the\nstudy. Funding dries up, researchers lose interest. On average, most\nsuccessful prospective longitudinal studies maintain 30 to 70 percent of their\nparticipants. Some of these studies only last several years. By hook and by\ncrook the Harvard Study has maintained an 84 percent participation rate for\n84 years, and it\u2019s still in good h ealth today.\nA LOT OF QUESTIONS. REALLY. A LOT.\nEach life story in our longitudinal study is built on a foundation of the\nparticipant\u2019s health and habits; a map of the physical facts and behaviors of\ntheir life, through time. To create a complete story of their health we gather\nregular information on weight and amount of exercise, smoking and drinking\nhabits, cholesterol levels, surgeries, complications. Their entire health\nrecord. We also record other basic facts, like the nature of their employment,\ntheir number of close friends, their hobbies and recreational activities. At a\ndeeper level we design questions to probe their subjective experience and\nthe less quantifiable aspects of their lives. We ask about job satisfaction,\nmarital satisfaction, methods of resolving conflicts, the psychological impact\nof marriages and divorces, childbirths and deaths. We ask about their\nwarmest memories of their mothers and fathers, their emotional bonds (or\nlack thereof) with siblings. We ask them to describe for us in detail the\nlowest moments of their lives, and to tell us who, if anyone, they could call if\nthey woke up frightened in the middle of the night.\nWe study their spiritual beliefs and political preferences, their church\nattendance and participation in community activities, their goals in life and\ntheir sources of worries. Many of our participants went to war, fought and\nkilled and saw their friends killed; we have their firsthand accounts and\nreflections on these experiences.\nEvery two years we send lengthy questionnaires that include room for\nopen-ended and personalized responses, every five years we collect\ncomplete health records from their doctors, and every fifteen years or so we\nmeet them face-to-face on, say, a porch in Florida, or in a coffee shop in\nnorthern Wisconsin. We take notes on how they look and behave, their level\nof eye contact, their clothes, and their living conditions.\nWe know who developed alcoholism, and who is in recovery. We know\nwho voted for Reagan, who voted for Nixon, who voted for John Kennedy. In\nfact, before his records were acquired by the Kennedy Library, we knew\nwho Kennedy voted for, because he was one of our participants.\nWe\u2019ve always asked how their children are doing, if they had them. Now\nwe are asking the children themselves\u2014women and men who are baby\nboom ers\u2014and one day we hope to ask their children\u2019s children.\nWe have blood samples, DNA samples, and reams of EKG, fMRI, EEG,\nand other brain imaging reports. We even have twenty-five actual brains,\ndonated by participants in a final act of generosity.\nWhat we cannot know is how, or even if, these things will be used in\nfuture studies. Science, like culture, is ever-evolving, and while most of the\ndata from the Study\u2019s past have proven useful, some of the most carefully\nmeasured variables early on were studied only because of profoundly flawed\nassumptions.\nIn 1938, for example, body  type was considered an important predictor\nof intelligence and even life satisfaction (mesomorphs\u2014or the athletically\nbuilt\u2014were believed to have advantages in most areas). The shape and\nprotuberances of the skull were thought to signify personality and mental\ncapacities. One of the initial intake questions was, for reasons unknown,\n\u201cAre you ticklish?\u201d and we continued asking that question for forty years, just\nin case.\nWith eight decades of hindsight we now know that these ideas range from\nvaguely harebrained to downright wrong. It is possible, or even likely, that\nsome of the data we are gathering today will be seen with similar\nbemusement or misgiving eighty years from today.\nThe point is that every study is a product of its time and the human beings\nwho conduct it. In the case of the Harvard Study, those human beings were\nmostly White, middle-aged, educated, heterosexual, and male. Because of\ncultural biases and the almost entirely White makeup of both the City of\nBoston and Harvard College in 1938, the Study founders took the convenient\nroute of studying only other White males. It\u2019s a common story, one that the\nHarvard Study must grapple with, even as we work to correct it. And though\nthere are findings that apply only to one or both of the groups that began the\nStudy in the 1930s , those narrow findings do not feature in this book .\nFortunately, we can now compare the findings of the original Harvard Study\nsample with our own expanded sample (which includes the wives, sons, and\ndaughters of our original participants) and also with studies that include\npeople with more diverse cultural and economic backgrounds, gender\nidentities, and ethnicities. In the coming pages we will emphasize the\nfindings that other studies corroborate\u2014findings that have been shown to be\ntrue for women, for people of color, for those identifying as LGBTQ+, for a\nfull range of socioeconomic groups globally\u2014for all of us. The aim of this\nbook  is to offer what we have learned about the human condition, to show\nyou what the Harvard Study has to say about the universal experience of\nbeing alive.\nMarc has taught at a women\u2019s college for over twenty-five years, and\neach year a new cohort of bright, excited students ask to participate in his\nresearch on well-being and how people\u2019s lives evolve across time. Ananya,\nfrom India, was one of these students. She was interested particularly in the\nlinks between adversity and adult well-being. Marc told Ananya about the\nHarvard Study\u2019s rich data on hundreds of people spanning their entire adult\nlives. But they were male, White, and born more than seven decades before\nAnanya. She wondered out loud what she could learn from the lives of\npeople so different from her\u2014especially old White men born a long time\nago.\nMarc suggested she spend the weekend reading through the files of just\none participant from the Harvard Study, and then they could talk again the\nfollowing week. Ananya came to the next meeting full of enthusiasm, and\nbefore Marc could even ask, said she wanted to do her research on the men\nin the Harvard Study. What persuaded her was the richness of the life\ndocumented in the files she read. Even though the particulars of this one\nparticipant\u2019s life were so different from her own in so many ways\u2014he came\nof age on a different continent, lived life with white rather than brown skin,\nidentified as a man not a woman, never went to college\u2014Ananya saw\nreflections of herself in his psychological experiences and challenges.\nThis is a story that has repeated itself almost every year; even more so in\nthe last few years as psychology and the world beyond it have reckoned with\nserious ongoing disparities related to ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Bob\nhimself experienced a similar hesitation when he was first asked to join the\nHarvard Study as its new director. He, too, had doubts about the relevance of\nthese lives and the quaintness of some of its research methods. He took a\nweekend to read through a few of the files and was hooked immediately, just\nas Ananya was. Just as we hope you will be.\nAn entire century has passed since our First Generation participants were\nborn, but humans are as complex as always, and the work is never over. As\nthe Harvard Study forges ahead into the next decade, we continue to refine\nand expand our collection of information with the idea that each piece of\ndata, each personal reflection or in-the-moment feeling, creates a more\ncomplete picture of the human condition and may help answer questions in\nthe future that we cannot currently envision. Of course, no picture of a human\nlife can ever be complete.\nBut we hope you\u2019ll come with us as we wade into some of the most\nelusive questions about human development. For example: Why do\nrelationships seem to be the key to a flourishing life? What factors in early\nchildhood s hape physical and mental health in mid and late life? What factors\nare most strongly associated with longer lifespans? Or with healthy\nrelationships? In short:\nWHAT MAKES A GOOD LIFE?\nWhen asked what they want out of life, one thing many people say is that\nthey simply want to \u201cbe happy.\u201d If he\u2019s honest, Bob might answer that\nquestion for himself in the same way. It\u2019s impossibly vague and yet somehow\nsays it all. Marc would probably take a second and then say, \u201cIt\u2019s more than\nthat.\u201d\nBut what does happiness mean? What would it look like in your life?\nOne way to find some answers to this question might be to simply ask\npeople what would make them happy, and then find commonalities. But, as\nwe\u2019ll show, one hard truth that we would all do well to accept is that people\nare terrible at knowing w hat is good f or them. We\u2019ll get into that later.\nMore important than how people would answer the question are the\nunspoken and internalized myths about what makes a happy life. There are\nmany, but chief among these myths is the idea that happiness is something you\nachieve. As if it were an award you could frame and hang on the wall. Or as\nif it were a destination, and after overcoming all of the obstacles in your\nway, you will finally arrive there, and then just hang out for the rest of your\nlife.\nOf course, it doesn\u2019t work that way.\nMore than two thousand years ago Aristotle used a term that is still in\nwide use in psychology today: eudaimonia. It refers to a state of deep well-\nbeing in which a person feels that their life has meaning and purpose. It is\noften contrasted with hedonia (the origin of the word hedonism), which\nrefers to the fleeting happiness of various pleasures. To put it another way, if\nhedonic happiness is what you mean when you say you\u2019re having a good\ntime, then eudaimonic happiness is what we mean when we say life is good.\nIt is a sense that, outside of this moment, regardless of how pleasurable or\nmiserable it is, your life is worth something, and valuable to you. It is the\nkind of well-being that can endure through both the ups and the dow ns.\nDon\u2019t worry, we won\u2019t be saying \u201cyour eudaimonic happiness\u201d over and\nover. But a quick word about what we will be saying, and what it means.\nSome psychologists object to the word \u201chappiness\u201d because it can mean\nanything from a temporary pleasure to an almost mythical sense of\neudaimonic purpose that few in reality manage to reach. So in lieu of\nhappiness, more nuanced terms like \u201cwell-being,\u201d \u201cwellness,\u201d \u201cthriving,\u201d\nand \u201cflourishing\u201d have become common in the popu lar psychological\nliterature. We use those terms in this book . Marc is particularly fond of the\nterms thriving and flourishing because they refer to an active and constant\nstate of becoming, rather than just a mood. But we still use \u201chappiness\u201d at\ntimes for the simple reason that this is how people talk about their lives.\nNobody  says, \u201cHow\u2019s your human flourishing?\u201d We say, \u201cAre you happy?\u201d\nAnd it\u2019s how, in casual conversation, we both find ourselves talking about\nour research as well. We talk about health and happiness, meaning and\npurpose. But we mean eudaimonic happiness. And despite the uncertainty\nabout the word, when people stop to think about what it really means, it\u2019s a\nnatural term. When a couple describe their new grandchild and say, \u201cWe\u2019re\nvery happy,\u201d or when someone in therapy describes her marriage as\n\u201cunhappy,\u201d it\u2019s clear the word refers to an enduring quality of life, not just a\npassing feeling. That is the spirit in which we use the term in this book .\nFROM THE DATA TO YOUR DAILY LIFE\nYou might be wondering how we can be so sure that relationships play\nsuch a central role in our health and happiness. How is it possible to\nseparate relationships from economic considerations, from good or bad luck,\nfrom difficult childhoods , or from any of the other important circumstances\nthat affect how we feel from day to day? Is it really possible to answer the\nquestion, What makes a good l ife?\nAfter studying hundreds of entire lives, we can confirm what all of us\nalready know deep down\u2014that a huge range of factors contribute to a\nperson\u2019s happiness. The delicate balance of economic, social, psychological\nand health contributors is complex and everchanging. Rarely can any single\nfactor be said, with absolute confidence, to cause any single result, and\npeople will always surprise you. That said, there really are answers to this\nquestion. If you look at the same kinds of data repeatedly over time, across\nlarge numbers of people and studies, patterns begin to emerge, and\npredictors of human thriving become clear. Among the many predictors of\nhealth and happiness, from good diet to exercise to level of income, a life of\ngood r elationships stands out for its pow er and consistency.\nThe Harvard Study is not the only multidecade longitudinal study of\nhuman psychological thriving in the world, and we consistently and\ndeliberately look to other studies to see if findings are robust across different\neras and different kinds of people. Each study has its own idiosyncrasies, so\nreplication of findings across multiple studies is scientifically compelling.\nA few significant examples of other longitudinal studies that collectively\nrepresent tens of thousands of people:\nThe British Cohor t Studies include five large, nationally\nrepresentative groups born in particular years (beginning with a group\nof baby boom ers born just after World War II and most recently\nincluding a group of children born at the start of the current millennium)\nand have followed them across their entire lives.\nThe Mills Longitudinal Study has followed a group of women\nsince their high school graduation in 1958.\nThe Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study\nbegan studying 91 percent of the children born in a small New Zealand\ncity in 1972 and continues to follow them into middle age (and more\nrecently to follow their children).\nThe Kauai Longitudinal Study ran for three decades and included\nall of the children born on the Hawaiian island of Kauai in 1955, most\nof whom were of Japanese, Filipino, and Hawaiian heritage.\nThe Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study\n(CHASRS), begun in 2002, intensively studied a diverse group of\nmiddle-aged men and women for more than a decade.\nThe Healthy Aging in Neighbor hoods  of Diversity Across the Life\nSpan (HANDLS) study has been examining the nature and sources of\nhealth disparities in thousands of Black and White adults (aged 35\u201364)\nin the city of Baltimore since 2004.\nFinally, in 1947, the Student Counc il Study began tracking the\nlives of women and men who were elected student council\nrepresentatives at Bryn Mawr, Haverford, and Swarthmore colleges.\nThis study was planned in part by researchers who had developed the\nHarvard Study, and was explicitly designed to capture the experience of\nwomen, who were not included in the original Harvard Study sample. It\nlasted more than three decades, and the original archival materials from\nthat study were recently rediscovered. Because of the Student Council\nStudy\u2019s connection with the Harvard Study, you will get to meet some of\nthese women in this book .\nAll of these studies, as well as our own Harvard Study, bear witness to\nthe importance of human connections. They show that people who are more\nconnected to family, to friends, and to community, are happier and physically\nhealthier than people who are less well connected. People who are more\nisolated than they want to be find their health declining sooner than people\nwho feel connected to others. Lonely people also live shorter lives. Sadly,\nthis sense of disconnection from others is growing across the world. About\none in four Americans report feeling lonely\u2014more than sixty million people.\nIn China, loneliness among older adults has markedly increased in recent\nyears, and Great Britain has appointed a minister of loneliness to address\nwhat has become a major public health challenge.\nThese are our neighbors, our children, ourselves. There are myriad\nsocial, economic, and technological reasons for this, but regardless of the\ncauses, the data could not be clearer: the shadow of loneliness and social\ndisconnection haunts our modern \u201cconnected\u201d world.\nYou may be asking right now if anything can actually be done about your\nown life. Are the qualities that make us social or shy just baked into our\npersonalities? Are we destined to be loved or lonely, destined to be happy or\nunhappy? Do our childhood experiences define us, forever? We get asked\nquestions like this a lot. Really, most of them boil down to this fear: Is it too\nlate for me?\nIt\u2019s something the Harvard Study has worked hard to answer. The\nprevious director of the Study, George Vaillant, spent a considerable amount\nof his career studying whether the ways that people respond to life\nchallenges\u2014the ways they cope\u2014can change. Thanks to George\u2019s work and\nthe work of others, we can say that the answer to that enduring question, Is it\ntoo late for me? is a definitive NO.\nIt is never too late. It\u2019s true that your genes and your experiences shape\nthe way you see the world, the way you interact with other people, and the\nway you respond to negative feelings. And it is certainly true that\noppor tunities for economic advancement and basic human dignity are not\nequally available to all, and some of us are born into positions of significant\ndisadvantage. But your ways of being in the world are not set in stone. It\u2019s\nmore like they are set in sand. Your childhood is not your fate. Your natural\ndisposition is not your fate. The neighborhood you grew up in is not your\nfate. The research shows this clearly. Nothing that has happened in your life\nprecludes you from connecting with others, from thriving, or from being\nhappy. People often think that once you get to adulthood, that\u2019s it\u2014your life\nand your way of living are set. But what we find by looking at the entirety of\nresearch into adult development is that this just isn\u2019t true. Meaningful change\nis possible.\nWe used a particular phrase a moment ago. We talked about people who\nare more isolated than they want to be. We use this phrase for a reason;\nloneliness is not only about physical separation from others. The number of\npeople you know does not necessarily determine your experience of\nconnectedness or loneliness. Neither do your living arrangements or your\nmarital status. You can be lonely in a crowd, and you can be lonely in a\nmarriage. In fact, we know that high-conflict marriages with little affection\ncan be worse for health than getting divorced.\nInstead, it is the quality of your relationships that matters. Simply put,\nliving in the midst of warm relationships is protective of both mind and body .\nThis is an important concept, the concept of protection. Life is hard, and\nsometimes it comes at you in full attack mode. Warm, connected relationships\nprotect against the slings and arrows of life and of getting old.\nOnce we had followed the people in the Harvard Study all the way into\ntheir 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife to see if we could\npredict who was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who\nwasn\u2019t. So we gathered together everything we knew about them at age 50\nand found that it wasn\u2019t their middle-aged cholesterol levels that predicted\nhow they were going to grow old; it was how satisfied they were in their\nrelationships. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships\nat age 50 w ere the healthiest (mentally and phy sically) at age 80.\nAs we investigated this connection further, the evidence continued to\ngrow. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that\non the days when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as\nhappy. But when people in unhappy relationships reported physical pain,\ntheir mood worsened, causing them additional emotional pain as well. Other\nstudies come to similar conclusions about the powerful role of relationships.\nA few touchstone examples from some of the longitudinal studies mentioned\nabove :\nWith a cohort of 3,720 Black and White adults (aged 35\u201364) , the Healthy\nAging in Neighborhoods  of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) study\nfound that participants who reported receiving more social support also\nreported less depression.\nIn the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS), a\nrepresentative study of Chicago residents, participants who were in\nsatisfying relationships reported higher levels of happiness.\nIn the birth cohort study based in Dunedin, New Zealand, social\nconnections in adolescence predicted well-being in adulthood better than\nacademic achievement.\nThe list goes on. But of course, science is not the only area of human\nknowledge that has something to say about the good life. In fact, science is\nthe newcomer.\nTHE ANCIENTS BEAT US TO IT\nThe idea that healthy relationships are good for us has been noted by\nphilosophers and religions for millennia. In a certain way, it is remarkable\nthat all through history people trying to understand human life keep coming to\nvery similar conclusions. But it makes sense. Even though our technologies\nand cultures continue to change\u2014more rapidly now than ever before\u2014\nfundamental aspects of the human experience endure. When Aristotle\ndeveloped the idea of eudaimonia, he was drawing on his observations of the\nworld, yes, but also on his own feelings; the same feelings we experience\ntoday. When Lao Tzu said more than twenty-four centuries ago \u201cThe more\nyou give to others, the greater your abundance\u201d he was noting a paradox that\nis still with us. They were living at a different time, but their world is still\nour world. Their wisdom is our inheritance, and we should take advantage of\nit.\nWe note these parallels with ancient wisdom to put our science into a\nbroader context and to highlight the eternal significance of these questions\nand findings. With a few exceptions, science has not been much interested in\nthe ancients, or in received wisdom. Striking out on its own path after the\nEnlightenment, science has been like the young hero on a quest for knowledge\nand truth. It may have taken hundreds of years, but in the area of human well-\nbeing, we are now approaching a full circle. Scientific knowledge is finally\ncatching up to the ancient wisdom that has survived the test of time.\nTHE BUMPY PATH OF DISCOVERY\nEvery day the two of us come to work to tackle the question of what\nmakes a good l ife. As the years have gone on, some results have surprised us.\nThings we\u2019ve assumed to be the case in fact were not. Things we assumed\nwould be false have proven to be true. In the coming chapters, we\u2019ll be\nsharing all of it\u2014or a lot of it\u2014with you.\nIn the next five chapters we explore the elemental nature of relationships\nand get specific about how to apply the book \u2019s most powerful lessons. We\ntalk about how knowing your perch in life\u2014where you are in the human\nlifespan\u2014can help you find meaning and happiness from day to day. We\ndiscuss the massively important concept of social fitness and why it\u2019s just as\ncrucial as physical fitness. We explore how curiosity and attention can\nimprove relationships and well-being; and offer some strategies for how to\ndeal with the fact that relationships also pose some of our greatest\nchallenges.\nIn later chapters, we\u2019ll dig into the nitty-gritty of specific types of\nrelationships, from what matters in long-term intimacy, to how early family\nexperience affects well-being and what to do about it, to the oft overlooked\noppor tunities for connection in the workplace, to the surprising benefits of all\ntypes of friendships. And through it all we will share the science that these\ninsights came from, and we\u2019ll hear from Harvard Study participants about\nhow all of these things have played out in their real lives, in real time, for\nnearly a century.\nAs director and associate director, we\u2019ve focused our lives on the\nHarvard Study and what it can teach us about happiness. We are blessed (and\nafflicted) by a fascination with the human condition. Bob is a psychiatrist and\npsychoanalyst who spends hours every day talking with people about their\ndeepest concerns. In addition to directing the Harvard Study, he teaches\nyoung psychiatrists how to do psychotherapy. He\u2019s been married for thirty-\nfive years, has two grown sons, and in his off hours spends a lot of time on a\nmeditation cushion practicing and teaching Zen Buddhism. Marc is a clinical\npsychologist and professor who has been teaching and training new\npsychologists and researchers for thirty years. He, too, is a practicing\ntherapist and is in a long marriage raising two sons. An avid sports fan, he\u2019s\noften found during his off hours connecting with others on a tennis court (and\nin his younger days, on a basketball court).\nThe two of us began our research collaboration and friendship almost\nthirty years ago. We met at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center, an iconic\ncommunity organization where we both worked with people struggling with\nmental illness in a setting of tremendous social and economic disadvantage.\nBoth of us felt called to understand the experiences of people from\nbackgrounds very different from our own, both in our clinical work and in\nour research on lives through time.\nThirty years later, we find ourselves still friends, still collaborating on\nresearch, and doing our best to shepherd the Harvard Study\u2019s vast treasure\ntrove of life stories toward its second century. In learning about these\nindividuals and their families, we\u2019ve also learned, and continue to learn,\nvaluable lessons about ourselves, and how to conduct our own lives. This\nbook  is an attempt to share those lessons, and to share the priceless gift the\nHarvard Study\u2019s participants have given the world. After all, they didn\u2019t\nagree to participate merely for the sake of researchers like us. They did it for\neveryone, everywhere. Their lives form the beating heart of this book .\nAlready we have seen the results of bringing these insights to the larger\nworld. In the course of our careers with the Study, we\u2019ve given hundreds of\nlectures on the findings that we\u2019ll share in the coming chapters, and we\u2019ve\nmarshaled everything we\u2019ve learned into our Lifespan Research Foundation,\na nonprofit dedicated to bringing the wisdom of lifespan development out of\nacademic journals and into tools that people can use to better their lives.\nOver and over, people have approached us after lectures and workshops to\nsay they feel a great relief hearing what we\u2019ve learned, because the lessons\nmake something abundantly clear: The good life is not always just out of\nreach after all. It is not waiting in the distant future after a dreamy career\nsuccess. It\u2019s not set to kick in after you acquire some massive amount of\nmoney. The good life is right in front of you, sometimes only an arm\u2019s length\naway. And it starts now.\n  2  \nWHY RELATIONSHIPS MATTER\nThe best ideas aren\u2019t hidden in shadowy recesses. They\u2019re right in\nfront of us, hidden in plain sight.\nRichard Farson and Ralph Keyes\nHarvard Study, Day 6 of \u201c8 Days\u201d Questionnaire, 2003\nQ: What is the secret to aging well?\nA: Happiness, caring. Watch what you\u2019re eating. Try to get out and do a little walking or exercise. Have friends.\nIt\u2019s so good to have friends.\nHarriet Vaughn, Study participant, age 80\nConsider the feeling you get when you love someone, or when you know\nyou are loved in return. Think about how you experience it in your body , the\nsensation of warmth and comfort. Now consider the similar but distinct\nfeeling of connection when a close friend helps you through a hard time. Or\nthe lasting exhilaration when someone you respect says they are proud of\nyou. Think about what it feels like to be moved to tears. Or when you get a\nsmall boos t of energy sharing a laugh with a coworker. Consider the physical\npain of losing someone dear to you. Or even the momentary pleasure of\nwaving at the mail carrier.\nThese feelings, big and small, are connected to biological processes. Just\nas our brain responds to the presence of food in our bellies by rewarding us\nwith pleasure sensations, so does it respond to positive contact with others.\nThe brain effectively says to us: Yes, more of this, please. Positive\ninteraction tells our bodies that we are safe, reducing our physical arousal\nand increasing our sense of well-being. By contrast, negative experiences\nand interactions create a sense that we are in danger and stimulate us to\nproduce stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones are\npart of a cascade of physical reactions that raise alertness and help us\nrespond to situations of critical importance\u2014the \u201cfight or flight\u201d response.\nThey are a big part of what gives us that feeling of stress.\nWe rely on the signals of these stress hormones and pleasurable\nsensations, as they guide us through the challenges and oppor tunities of life.\nAvoid danger, seek connection.\nThese reactions to rewarding and threatening situations have a long\nevolutionary history. Homo sapiens have been walking around the planet for\nhundreds of thousands of years with these biological guides to living built\ninside of us. That little ping of joy you get when a baby laughs at your silly\nexpression is biologically linked to the one your distant ancestors got when\nthey made a baby laugh in the year 100,000 B C.\nPrehistoric humans were threatened in ways we can hardly conceive of\ntoday. They had similar bodies, but primitive technology gave them only\nminimal protection from the environment and predatory animals, and\nvirtually no remedies for injury or other health problems. A toothache could\nend in death. They lived short, hard, and probably terrifying lives. And yet\nthey survived. W hy?\nOne important reason is a trait that early Homo sapiens shared with many\nother successful animal species: their bodies and brains had evolved to\nencourage coope ration.\nThey survived because they were social.\nThe human animal is not much different today, though the project of\nsurvival has taken on new meanings and complications. Compared to\ncenturies past, life in the twenty-first century is changing faster than ever\nbefore, and many of the threats to our lives are of our own making. Along\nwith challenges related to climate change, growing income inequality, and the\nvast complications of new communications technologies, we must deal with\nnew threats to our internal states of mind. Loneliness is more pervasive than\never before, and our ancient brains, designed to seek the safety of groups,\nexperience those negative feelings as life-threatening, which leads to stress\nand sickness. With each year that passes, civilization is presented with new\nchallenges that were unimaginable even fifty years ago. It also presents new\nchoices, which means life paths are now more varied than ever. But\nregardless of the pace of change and the choices many of us now have, this\nfact remains: the human animal has evolved to be connected with other\nhumans.\nTo say that human beings require warm relationships is no touchy-feely\nidea. It is a hard fact. Scientific studies have told us again and again: human\nbeings need nutrition, we need exercise, we need purpose, and we need each\nother.\nWe are often asked to summarize the findings of the Harvard Study.\nPeople want to know: What is the most important thing we\u2019ve learned? Both\nof us are by nature resistant to simple answers so these conversations are\noften not as short as the questioners might like. But when we really think\nabout the consistent signal that comes through after eighty-four years of study\nand hundreds of research papers, it is that one simple message:\nPositive relationships are essential to hum an w ell-being.\nWe\u2019ll go out on a limb and guess that if you\u2019re reading this book , you are\nseeking wisdom or you are at least curious about what makes for a good life.\nYou want a life that has meaning and purpose and joy, and you want to be\nhealthy. If we go a little further out on that limb, we might even guess that you\nare already trying, to the best of your ability, to be happy and healthy. You\nhave some idea of who you are, of your likes and dislikes and emotions and\nsocial abilities. Day by day you try to live your best life. And if you\u2019re like\nmost of us, you don\u2019t always succeed.\nThroughout this book , we\u2019ll be addressing some of the common reasons\nwhy people have a hard time finding happiness and satisfaction in life, but\nthere are a couple of general truths that should be acknowledged right off the\nbat.\nThe first is this: the good life may be a central concern for most people,\nbut it is not the central concern of most modern societies. Life today is a haze\nof competing social, political, and cultural priorities, some of which have\nvery little to do with improving people\u2019s lives. The modern world prioritizes\nmany things ahead of the lived experience of human beings.\nThe second reason is related and even more fundamental: our brains, the\nmost sophisticated and mysterious system in the known universe, often\nmislead us in our quest for lasting pleasure and satisfaction. We may be\ncapable of extraordinary feats of intellect and creativity, we may have\nmapped the human genome and walked on the moon, but when it comes to\nmaking decisions about our lives, we humans are often bad at knowing what\nis good for us. Common sense in this area of life is not so sensible. It\u2019s very\ndifficult to figure out what really matters.\nThese two things\u2014the haze of culture and the mistakes we make in\nforecasting what will make us happy\u2014are woven together and play a role in\nour lives every single day. Over the course of a life, they exert significant\ninfluence. The culture we live in leads us in particular directions, sometimes\nwithout our even noticing, and we follow along, outwardly pretending that\nwe know what we\u2019re doing, but inwardly in a state of low-grade confusion.\nBefore we talk some more about the cultural and personal ways we can\nbe led away from the good life, let\u2019s look at the lives of two Harvard Study\nparticipants who have already been through the entirety of life\u2019s gauntlet, and\nsee what their experiences can teach us about what matters, and what\ndoesn\u2019t.\nTHE LUCK OF THE DRAW\nIn 1946,  John Marsden and Leo DeMarco were both at major crossroads\nin their lives. Both had the good fortune of recently graduating from Harvard,\nboth volunteered to serve in the military during World War II\u2014John could\nnot engage in active duty because of health complications and served\nstateside, and Leo served in the Navy in the South Pacific. Once the war was\nover, both were about to step forward into the rest of their lives. They had\nwhat most people would consider a leg up (or many legs up): John\u2019s family\nwas wealthy, Leo\u2019s was upper-middle-class, they were graduates of an elite\nuniversity, and they were male and White in a society that privileged White\nmen. Not to mention that in the aftermath of the war, a lot of social and\neconomic support was being given to veterans through the federally funded\nG.I. Bill and in local communities. The good life, it seemed, was waiting for\nthem.\nWhile almost two thirds of the original men in the Harvard Study came\nfrom the poorest and most disadvantaged neighborhoods  in Boston, the\nremaining third attended Harvard as undergraduates. Groomed to succeed,\nevery one of these college men should have been a poster child for The Good\nLife in America. Like John and Leo, some came from well-to-do families,\nmost pursued professional careers and married, and many achieved\neconomic and professional success.\nHere we see an example of common sense leading us astray. Many of us\nnaturally assume that the material conditions of people\u2019s lives determine\ntheir happiness. We assume that people who are less advantaged must be less\nhappy and that people who are more advantaged must be happier. Science\ntells a more complicated story. When you study the lives of thousands of\nindividuals, patterns emerge that do not always fit with popu lar conceptions\nabout how things are suppos ed to go. Individual lives like John\u2019s and Leo\u2019s\noffer a look at what really matters.\nJohn had a choice: to stay in Cleveland, work in the office of his father\u2019s\ndry goods  franchise, and eventually take it over, or to follow his lifelong\ndream and go to law school (he\u2019d just been accepted to the University of\nChicago law school). He was fortunate to have that choice to make. Looking\nonly at the trappings of his life, many people would think that John was\ndestined for happiness.\nHe decided to go to law school. John had always been a diligent student,\nand he kept that up. According to John himself, his success was due more to\nhard work than any special intelligence. He told the Study that his main\nmotivation was a fear of failure, and he even intentionally avoided dating so\nas not to be distracted. When he graduated from the University of Chicago, he\nwas near the top of his class and began fielding attractive job offers,\neventually settling on a firm that encouraged the kind of public service work\nhe hoped to do. He began consulting for the federal government about the\nadministration of public services, and also taught classes at the University of\nChicago. His father, though disappointed that John had left the family\nbusiness, was also very proud. John was on his way.\nLeo, on the other hand, had dreamed of becoming a writer and journalist.\nHe studied history at Harvard, and during the war kept meticulous diaries,\nthinking that he might use them for a book  someday. His experiences in the\nwar convinced him that he was on the right path\u2014he wanted to write about\nhow history affects the lives of ordinary people. But while he was overseas,\nhis father died, and soon after he arrived home his mother was diagnosed\nwith Parkinson\u2019s disease. As the oldest of three children, he decided to move\nback to Burlington, Vermont, to care for and be near her, and soon found\nhimself teaching high school.\nShortly after he started his first teaching job, Leo met Grace, a woman\nwith whom he fell deeply in love. They were married immediately and\nwithin a year had their first child. After that, the outlines of his life were\nmostly set. He continued teaching high school for the next forty years and\nnever pursued his dream of becoming a writer.\nWe skip ahead twenty-nine years, to February 1975. Both men are 55.\nJohn got married at 34 and is now a successful lawyer, making $52,000 per\nyear. Leo is still a high school teacher, making $18,000 per year. One day\nthey receive the same questionnaire in the mail.\nLet\u2019s imagine John Marsden in his law office, sitting at his desk between\nappointments, and Leo DeMarco at his desk at Burlington High School, while\nhis ninth grade students are puzzling over a history exam. The two men\nanswer questions about their health, their recent family history, and\neventually each of them comes to a set of 180 True/False questions. Among\nthem is this one:\nTrue or False:\nLife has more pain than pleasure.\nTo which John (the lawyer) writes:\nTrue.\nAnd Leo (the teacher) writes:\nFalse.\nAnd this one:\nTrue or False:\nI often feel starved for affection.\nTo this, John responds:\nTrue.\nAnd Leo responds:\nFalse.\nThey go on to answer questions about their alcohol use (both have one\ndrink every day), their sleep habits, their political ideas, their religious\npractices (both attend church every Sunday), and later they come to these two\nquestions:\nComplete the following sentences any way you wish:\nA man feels good when\u2026\nJohn:\n\u2026 he is able to respond to inner drives.\nLeo:\n\u2026 he senses that his family loves him despite everything.\nAnd:\nBeing with other people\u2026\nJohn:\n\u2026 is pleasant.\nLeo:\n\u2026 is pleasant (up to a point!).\nJohn Marsden, one of the more professionally successful members of the\nStudy, was also one of the least happy. Like Leo DeMarco he wanted to be\nclose to people, as this last answer shows, and he loved his family, but he\nconsistently reported feelings of disconnection and sadness throughout his\nlife. He struggled in his first marriage and alienated his children. When John\nremarried at the age of 62, he quickly began to refer to that new relationship\nas \u201cloveless,\u201d though it would last to the end of his life. Later we\u2019ll talk\nmore about John\u2019s path to despair, and some of the factors that likely shaped\nhis suffering, but there is one particular feature of John\u2019s life that concerns us\nright now: while John tried hard to make himself happy, he was preoccupied\nat every stage of his life with himself, and what he referred to as his \u201cinner\ndrives.\u201d He began his career hoping to make life better for others, but over\ntime associated his achievements less with helping people and more with\nprofessional success. Convinced that his career and his accomplishments\nwould bring him happiness, he was never able to find a path to joy.\nLeo DeMarco, on the other hand, thought of himself primarily in relation\nto others\u2014his family, his school, and his friends appear often in his reports\nto the Study\u2014and he is generally considered to be one of the Study\u2019s\nhappiest men. But when one of Harvard\u2019s researchers interviewed Leo in\nmiddle age, she wrote, \u201cI came away from our visit with the impression that\nthe subject was, well\u2026 somewhat ordinary.\u201d\nHowever, by his own accounting of things, Leo lived a rich and satisfying\nlife. He wouldn\u2019t show up on the evening news and his name was not known\nbeyond his local community, but he had four daughters and a wife who\nadored him, was remembered fondly by friends, colleagues, and students,\nand throughout his life rated himself as \u201cvery happy\u201d or \u201cextremely happy\u201d\non study questionnaires. Unlike John, Leo found his work meaningful\nspecifically because he took pleasure in the benefit that other people derived\nfrom his teaching.\nIt\u2019s easy enough now, looking back on these two men\u2019s lives, to see the\nlinks between what they each believed, the decisions they made, and how\ntheir lives unfolded. But why is it so difficult in the moment to make\ndecisions that will benefit our well-being? Why do we so often overlook\nsources of happiness that are right in front of us? An experiment conducted\nby researchers at the University of Chicago illuminates one central piece of\nthe puzzle.\nSTRANGERS ON A TRAIN\nImagine you\u2019re on a train. Strangers are seated all around you. You\u2019d like\nto have the most pleasant possible train ride, and you have a choice: talk to a\nstranger or keep to yourself. Which do y ou choose?\nWe know what most of us do: we keep to ourselves. Who wants to deal\nwith a random stranger? They\u2019ll probably talk our ear off. Also, we want to\nget some work done or just enjoy some music or a podc ast.\nThis kind of prediction about what will make us happy is known in\npsychology as \u201caffective forecasting.\u201d We are constantly making predictions\nabout how all kinds of things in our lives, large and small, will make us feel.\nResearchers at the University of Chicago turned their local train into an\naffective forecasting experiment. They asked commuters to predict which of\ntwo scenarios\u2014talking to a stranger or minding your own business\u2014would\nmake for a more positive experience. Then they instructed one group to\nintentionally connect with a nearby stranger and the other group to remain\ndisconnected. When the ride was over, they asked the commuters how they\nfelt about the train ride.\nBefore the ride, people overwhelmingly predicted that talking to\nsomeone they didn\u2019t know would be a bad experience, and that keeping to\nthemselves would be much better. They were forecasting what would make\nthem happy, and what would make them miserable. The actual experience,\nhowever, was the oppos ite of what they expected. When commuters were\ntold to strike up a conversation, most had a positive experience and rated\ntheir commute as better than usual, and those who typically worked on the\ntrain reported that the trip was no less productive when they talked to a\nstranger.\nThere is a lot of research like this suggesting that human beings are bad at\naffective forecasting. Not just in short-term situations like the train study, but\nin the long term, too. We seem particularly bad at forecasting the benefits of\nrelationships. A big part of this is the obvious fact that relationships can be\nmessy and unpredictable. This messiness is some of what prompts many of us\nto prefer being alone. It\u2019s not just that we are seeking solitude; it\u2019s that we\nwant to avoid the potential mess of connecting with others. But we\noverestimate that mess and underestimate the beneficial effects of human\nconnection. This is a feature of our decision making in general: we pay a lot\nof attention to pot ential costs and dow nplay or dismiss potential benefits.\nThis is the situation in which many of us find ourselves. We avoid things\nthat we think will make us feel bad and pursue things that we think will\nmake us feel good. Our instincts don\u2019t always lead us astray, but there are\nimportant areas in which they do. Like John Marsden, many of us end up\nmaking some pretty big decisions (like which career to pursue) or the same\nsmall decisions (like never talking to strangers) over and over, based on\nfaulty thinking that seems perfectly logical. Rarely do we get the oppor tunity\nto see the error.\nThis would all be difficult enough if we lived in a vacuum where no\noutside forces were affecting our decisions; the problem is compounded\nwhen we subject our decision making to the cultural influences we face,\nwhich themselves contain some ideas that can get us off track. We are not the\nonly ones forecasting what will make us happy; the culture we live in is also\nforecasting for us.\nUNDER THE SPELL OF CULTURE\nIn his commencement address to Kenyon College in 2005, the writer\nDavid Foster Wallace used a parable to poi nt out an indelible truth:\nThere are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen\nto meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and\nsays, \u201cMorning, boys. How\u2019s the water?\u201d And the two young fish swim\non for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and\ngoes, \u201cWhat the hell is water?\u201d\nEvery culture\u2014from the broad culture of a nation down to the culture\ninside a family\u2014is at least partially invisible to its participants. There are\nimportant assumptions, value judgments, and practices that create the water\nwe swim in without our noticing or agreeing to them. We simply find\nourselves in this world, and we move forward. These features of culture\naffect just about everything in our lives, often in positive ways, connecting us\nto each other and creating identities and meaning. But there is a flip side.\nSometimes cultural messages and practices point us in directions away from\nwell-being and happiness.\nSo let\u2019s stop for a second, as Wallace was encouraging the graduating\nstudents to do, a nd notice some of the cultural water.\nIn the 1940s  and 1950s , when John, Leo, and the other original\nparticipants of the Harvard Study were growing into adults, American culture\nbrimmed with assumptions\u2014as it does today, and as it will tomorrow\u2014\nabout what a good life looks like. These assumptions percolated down into\ntheir lives, and more importantly, into their life choices. John, for example,\nwas convinced that pursuing law and becoming a lawyer\u2014a respected\nprofession\u2014would lay the groundwork for his future happiness. The culture\nhe grew up in created the conditions for this belief to seem like a truism.\nThis is complicated terrain because the things that our respective cultures\nencourage us to pursue\u2014money, achievement, status, and other things\u2014are\nrarely complete mirages. Money allows us to acquire important things that\nwe need for well-being; achievements are often satisfying and aiming for\nthem can provide goals that give purpose to our lives, and allow us to move\nforward into new, exciting realms; and status gives us a certain social respect\nthat can allow us to effect positive change. But money, achievement, and\nstatus all have a tendency to overtake other priorities. This, too, is a function\nof our ancient brains: we focus on what is most visible, and most immediate.\nThe value of relationships is ephemeral and hard to quantify, but money can\nbe counted. Achievements can be listed on a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, and social media\nfollowers tick up in the right-hand corner of your screen. These countable\nvictories give us small pulses of feeling that we like\u2014pleasing sensations,\nremnants of those ancient signals. As we go through life we can see it all\naccumulating, and we pursue these goals without always thinking about why\nwe\u2019re pursuing them. Soon enough we find ourselves beyond the realm\nwhere these culturally approved pursuits affect our lives and other people in\npositive ways, and into the realm where they become ends in themselves.\nHere, the pursuits become abstracted, more symbolic than tangible, and the\nchase for a better life starts to look more like running in circles.\nThere is a lot to say about all of these objects of desire and their\npsychological underpinnings, but for the sake of illustration let\u2019s take a\ncloser look at one emblematic keystone, a persistent cultural assumption,\nshared among many cultures all over the world, that is not only old but\nancient and shows no signs of going anywhere:\nThe foundation of a good l ife is money.\nOf course very few people would say it like this with a straight face, but\nsigns of the strength of this belief are evident all around us. We see it in the\nequation of well-paying jobs with \u201cgood\u201d  jobs, in the fascination with the\nultrawealthy, in the increasingly pragmatic educational system (\u201cYou go to\nschool to get a \u2018better\u2019 job\u201d), in the glamorous promises of consumer\nproducts, and in many other avenues of life. It is a story so much a part of the\ncultural water that it survives despite the fact that philosophers, writers, and\nartists have been warning against the seductions of wealth for thousands of\nyears.\nAristotle, for example, outlined the problem two thousand years ago.\n\u201cThe life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion,\u201d he wrote,\n\u201cand wealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful\nand for the sake of something else.\u201d\nWe might list a hundred similar sentiments, articulated in every era of\nhistory (\u201cMoney has never made man happy, nor will it.\u201d\u2014Ben Franklin, or:\n\u201cDon\u2019t make money your goal. Instead pursue the things you love doing and\nthen do them so well that people can\u2019t take their eyes off you.\u201d\u2014Maya\nAngelou). All of these sentiments trickle down and coalesce into that clich\u00e9d\nrefrain: Money can\u2019t buy happiness.\nThe idea is so common that it has itself been folded into capitalist\ncultures all over the world. People tell each other all the time that money\nisn\u2019t the answer, and yet money remains a central object of desire in cultures\nalmost everywhere.\nThe main reason for this is not much of a mystery. The idea that money\nbuys happiness maintains its allure because every day we see the ways it\naffects how people live.\nIn America, income inequality has been increasing for decades and is\nconnected to all kinds of other inequalities, from discrepancies in access to\nhealth care to the fact that rich people have shorter commutes to work. The\noverall effect of money is so significant that people with high incomes can\nexpect to live ten to fifteen years longer than people with low incomes. The\nmen in the Harvard Study are no different; on average, the college men had\nsignificantly higher incomes than the Boston inner-city men, and lived 9.1\nyears longer.\nSo the idea that money may be a major shaper of happiness is, in some\nways, a commonsense observation. And yet it does not reflect the whole\ntruth. To understand the extent to which money affects happiness and well-\nbeing, we have to look a bit deeper and ask, as Aristotle was suggesting:\nWhat is the money for?\nWHAT WE TALK ABOUT WHEN WE TALK\nABOUT MONEY\nIn 2010 Angus Deaton and Daniel Kahneman at Princeton University\ntried to quantify the relationship of money to happiness using a year-long\nGallup survey that resulted in a massive dataset of 450,000 daily responses\nfrom a nationally representative sample of one thousand people.\nDeaton and Kahneman showed that in the United States, $75,000  seemed\nto be a kind of magic number at that time. Once a household income was\nmore than $75,000 pe r year, which was close to the average family income in\nthe U.S. at the time of the study, the amount of money that people earned\nshowed no clear relationship to daily reports of enjoyment and laughter,\nwhich were used as indicators of emotional well-being.\nThis study finding seems to reinforce the idea that money can\u2019t buy\nhappiness, but the other half of the finding was equally as significant: for\nthose making less than $75,000 per year, more income did correlate,\nmodestly, with more happiness.\nWhen money is scarce, and basic needs cannot be met with certainty, life\ncan be incredibly stressful, and in this situation, every dollar matters. Having\na basic amount of money allows people to meet those needs, have some\ncontrol over life, and in many countries affords access to better health care\nand living conditions.\nThe study by Deaton and Kahneman is memorable for estimating a dollar\namount where happiness plateaus, but the meaning of the study was not new.\nIt is largely consistent with other research that has used different methods and\nbeen conducted across multiple countries and cultures that vary in wealth.\nThese studies have paid attention both to how money affects individual\nhappiness and to whether increasing wealth for an entire nation affects the\noverall happiness of the popu lation. Regardless of their methods and\nlocations, these studies point to a similar conclusion: money matters most at\nlower levels of income where a dollar, euro, rupee, or yuan is used to\nprovide basic needs and a sense of security. Once you get beyond that\nthreshold, money does not seem to matter much, if at all, when it comes to\nhappiness. As Deaton and Kahneman wrote in their study, \u201cMore money does\nnot necessarily buy more happiness, but less money is associated with\nemotional pain.\u201d\nAt lower levels of income, money brings tangible benefits that are\nnecessary for survival, safety, and a sense of control. But at slightly higher\nlevels of income (and this needn\u2019t be $75,000)  the meaning of money starts to\nbecome somewhat more abstract and becomes about other things, like status\nand pride.\nMaybe none of this comes as a major surprise to you. Maybe for you,\nmoney is not about stuff, and not about status, but about freedom. Money has\na lot of power in the world, you might think, and the more money I have, the\nmore choice and control I will have.\nIt\u2019s understandable to feel this way. Money is woven deep into the\nfoundations of modern societies. It is tied to achievement, to status, to self-\nworth, to feelings of freedom and self-determination, to our ability to care for\nand give joy to our families, to fun. To everything. It\u2019s natural that we see it\nas a central medium through which we interact with the world and pursue so\nmany things in life.\nEven Leo DeMarco, the teacher, who built his life around connections\nwith his family and students, was very conscious of money. In addition to his\ncareful retirement savings, he set aside a small amount for many years and\nused those savings to buy a fishing boat (which his oldest daughter named\nDolores). That boat featured in all of his children\u2019s memories. Leo used\nmoney as a means to achieve some satisfying personal ends\u2014ends that\nconnected him to the people he cared about.\nHowever, when money becomes the point, rather than a tool, it joins\nranks with other persistent objects of desire that are imbued with importance\nby the culture around us. Things like fame and career success. Or, as Richard\nSennett and Jonathan Cobb framed it in their book  The Hidden Injuries of\nClass, \u201cbadges of ability.\u201d That is, personal merits that are publicly\nacknowledged.\nSome of our happiness also depends on what we see when we look at our\nneighbors. It is human nature to compare ourselves to others. How big is the\ngap between the lives we see all around us\u2014in the real world, in\nentertainment and social media\u2014and what we believe is possible in our own\nlives? Research has shown that the more we compare ourselves to others\u2014\neven when the comparison is in our favor\u2014the less happy we are. And the\nbigger the disparities we see, the greater our unhappiness. So, like many\nthings happiness-related, money\u2019s effect on us is simple and it\u2019s complicated.\nBut maybe the reason we never find an answer to the question Can money\nbuy happi ness? is because we\u2019re asking the wrong question.\nMaybe the right question is: What actually makes me happy ?\nA BOY FROM CHARLESTOWN\nWhen Alan Silva was 14 years old he was in love with the movies. In the\nsummer of 1942, he got a job shining shoes in Thompson Square so that\ntwice a week he could head over to a theater in Charlestown and spend his\nafternoon with James Cagney or Susan Hayward. He\u2019d go with friends, and\nwhen they weren\u2019t around, he\u2019d go by himself. He\u2019d see every movie twice,\nand if it wasn\u2019t good, the second time he\u2019d complain to the ticket taker. On\nthe way home he might detour to the Charlestown marina to see who he could\nfind, since he was part of the Community Sailing Club, a local organization\nthat taught kids to sail. If nothing too interesting was happening at the marina\nhe\u2019d head up to Chelsea Street and wait for the right kind of delivery truck to\ndrive by\u2014on e with a handrail on the back\u2014so he could sneak up behind and\nhop a ride back home. But he kept that part a secret. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t do any truck\nhopping,\u201d his mother told the Harvard Study. \u201cI\u2019ve warned him about losing\nlegs.\u201d\nLike most of the Boston kids in the Study, the Silva family lived in\npove rty. Alan\u2019s father was a Portuguese immigrant and worked as a\nmachinist at the Navy Yard, and his income was just enough to keep food on\nthe table. Alan, an excitable, busy kid, was blissfully unaware of the\nfinancial stress his parents experienced.\nThe researcher who interviewed him at 14 described him as \u201cwildly\nadventurous.\u201d\n\u201cHe comes running in all out of breath,\u201d his mother said, \u201cand then he just\ntalks talks talks.\u201d She was inclined to allow him some freedom, something\nher mother-in-law, who lived with them in their three-room apartment,\nalways complained about, since she thought Alan would get into the wrong\ngroup, start stealing, and his life would go dow n the drain.\n\u201cI\u2019m not too strict,\u201d his mother said. \u201cI let him do what other kids do. It\u2019s\nnormal. My mother was too strict and it made me moody . Now I read child\npsychology book s.\u201d\nIn addition to being adventurous, Alan was ambitious. If he wasn\u2019t at the\nmovies or sailing or hopping trucks, he was home tinkering with an Erector\nSet that his father bought him for Christmas. He wanted to learn everything he\ncould about building things. He believed he had control over his life, which\nalso led him to believe something many of the other Boston kids in the Study\ndidn\u2019t: that he could go to college.\nThe two groups of the Harvard Study\u2014the Boston men and the Harvard\nmen\u2014are different in many ways. Taken together, the two reflect some hard\nrealities about the effect of poverty and the differences in life outcomes\nbetween the working class and the professional class.\nBut certain relational advantages retain their power across this\nsocioeconomic divide. In Alan Silva\u2019s case, he had a mother who loved him;\nshe advocated for him, believed in him, and supported his aspirations.\nThanks in part to her encouragement and support, Alan Silva was one of the\nfew Boston men who went to college. Shortly after graduating with a degree\nin electrical engineering he was hired by the telephone company and had a\nlong career, retiring at age 56.\nAt 95, Alan doesn\u2019t care for new movies, but he catches some of his old\nfavorites on TV. When we asked him in 2006 what he was most proud of in\nhis life, he did not talk about his career or his college degree:\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be married forty-eight years this year. Children turned out good\nand grandchildren, too. I\u2019m proud of my family.\u201d\nAlan\u2019s story brings to life the lessons of the Harvard Study on the power\nof relationships, and it reminds us of an important truth: all of us have a rich\nmix of things we can\u2019t control and things we can. Each of us must find ways\nto work with the hand we\u2019re dealt.\nHOW MUCH OF OUR HAPPINESS IS UNDER\nOUR CONTROL?\nHappiness and freedom begin with a clear understanding of one\nprinciple. Some things are within your control. And some things are not.\nEpictetus, Discourses\nEpictetus, another of the great Greek philosophers, was born a slave, so\nthe question of control was personal to him. We don\u2019t even know the name\nhis mother gave him; Epictetus is a Greek word meaning \u201cacquired.\u201d\nWhen we obsess over things that fall outside of our control, Epictetus\nsaid, we make ourselves miserable. So an important project of life is\ndistinguishing which is which.\nThe theologian Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s \u201cSerenity Prayer\u201d is a modern\nversion of this idea, and while the original version is somewhat different, it\nis commonly quoted in this way:\nGod, gr ant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot  change ,\ncourage to change  the things I can,\nand w isdom to know the difference.\nPeople often think, for understandable reasons, True happiness is beyond\nreach for me because there is so much that I can\u2019t help that is set in stone. I\u2019m\nnot genetically gifted; I\u2019m not extroverted; I endured trauma in my past and\nam still struggling with it; I\u2019m not privileged in the ways that seem to\nadvantage others in this imbalanced and unfair world.\nLots of things matter in the lottery of life. We may not like it, but there are\nthings we are born with or born into that affect our well-being and are also\nbeyond our immediate, personal control. Genetics matter. Gender matters.\nIntelligence. Disability. Sexual orientation. Race. And all of these matter, of\ncourse, because of our cultural biases and practices. Black Americans, for\nexample, are one of the least advantaged\u2014if not the least advantaged\u2014\ngroups in the United States. On average, Black Americans have less savings,\nhigher rates of incarceration, and poorer health outcomes than any other\nracial group, all of which contribute to a persistent socioeconomic\ndisadvantage that is difficult to break out of. And as Deaton and Kahneman\u2019s\nstudy and many others show, socioeconomic status can have an effect on\nemotional well-being.\nThis brings us back to the Harvard Study, and an important question about\nits ethnic makeup: How could the lives of White men like John, Leo, and\nHenry, men who grew up in America in the middle of the twentieth century,\nhave anything to say about modern women or people of color, about people\nfrom entirely different countries, cultures, and backgrounds? Aren\u2019t the\nfindings of the Harvard Study only relevant to the demographics of its\nparticipants?\nWhen Marc is asked this question, he thinks of a startling and influential\npaper published in the journal Science. The paper sought to determine if\nthere was a link between social connection and the risk of dying at any age,\nand it looked at both women and men from five studies conducted in five\ndifferent places around the world.\nOne of these places was Evans County, Georgia, another was eastern\nFinland.\nThere are probably few greater contrasts than the life of a Black woman\nwho grew up in the American South in the 1960s  and the life of a White man\nliving on the shore of a frozen lake in Finland. At just about any level of\nexperience you can imagine, one would expect to see some major\ndifferences.\nAll five studies were prospective and longitudinal; like the Harvard\nStudy, they looked at lives as they unfolded ove r time.\nFor both men and women, geography and race mattered, as they do in\nmany studies. Individuals in Evans County had the highest mortality rates in\nthe study on average, and those in eastern Finland had the lowest. Within\nEvans County, Blacks had a higher risk of dying at any point in their lives\nthan Whites did, though that difference was relatively small when compared\nto the difference between Finland and Evans County. Taken together, these\ndifferences are stark and meaningful. But this is only a part of the story.\nPulling back a bit more, the data for the men and women in all five locations\ndisplay a remarkably similar pattern: people who were more socially\nconne cted had less risk of dying at any age. Whether you were a Black\nwoman in rural Georgia or a White man in Finland, the more connected you\nwere to others, the lower your risk of dying in any given year.\nThis consistency of findings across different locations and demographic\ngroups is what scientists call \u201creplication,\u201d the holy grail of research, and\nnot easy to come by. Just because a scientific study found something\ninteresting does not mean that the matter is settled. Good science requires\nthat findings be replicated. Especially when the object of study is something\nas complex as human life, it is crucial that we find a consistent signal across\nmany studies, all pointing in a similar direction. Only then can we have\nconfidence that what we\u2019re seeing is not a fluke.\nMore than twenty years after this analysis of five studies, another much\nlarger study cemented the connection between relationships and risk of\nmortality. Julianne Holt-Lunstad and her colleagues looked at 148 studies\nconducted in countries all over the world (Canada, Denmark, Germany,\nChina, Japan, Israel, and others) with a combined total of more than 300,000\nparticipants. This analysis echoes the findings of the study highlighted in the\narticle in Science: across all age groups, genders, and ethnicities, strong\nsocial connections were associated with increased odds  of living longer. In\nfact, Holt-Lunstad and her colleagues quantified the association: incredibly,\nsocial conne ction increased the likelihood of surviving in any given year\nby more than 50 percent. Across all of these studies, the mortality rate of\nindividuals with the fewest ties was between 2.3 (men) and 2.8 (women)\ntimes higher than that of individuals with the most ties. These are very large\nassociations, comparable to the effect of smoking on getting cancer. And\nsmoking, in the United States, is considered the leading cause of preventable\ndeath.\nHolt-Lunstad\u2019s study was done in 2010. As time goes on, study after\nstudy, including our own, continues to reinforce the connection between good\nrelationships and health, regardless of a person\u2019s location, age, ethnicity, or\nbackground. Although the life of a poor Italian kid who grew up during the\nGreat Depression in South Boston and the life of a 1940 Harvard graduate\nwho went on to become a senator are quite different from each other\u2014and\neven more different from a modern woman of color\u2014we all share a common\nhumanity. Like the Holt-Lunstad review, analyses of hundreds of studies tell\nus that the basic benefits of human connection do not change much from one\nneighborhood to the next, from one city to the next, from one country to the\nnext, or from one race to the next. It is indisputable that many societies are\nunequal; there are cultural practices and systemic factors causing significant\namounts of inequity and emotional pain. But the capacity of relationships to\naffect our well-being and health is universal.\nAs we proceed, we\u2019ll focus on identifying what you can do, regardless of\nthe society you live in, or the color of your skin. We will highlight the\nmalleable factors that have been shown to affect an individual\u2019s quality of\nlife, across many disparate circumstances. Factors that can have an impact on\nyour life and that are under your control.\nBut what kind of impact? How important are the things we can\u2019t change\nversus the things we can?\nWe are asked this question a lot, in different forms. One of us will be\ndiscussing our research after a talk or in a casual setting and suddenly\nsomeone will develop a worried look, and we can almost hear the question\nbefore it\u2019s asked:\n\u201cIf my main worry is money and health care, is any of this relevant to\nme?\u201d\nOr: \u201cIf I\u2019m shy and have trouble making friends, is the good life out of\nreach?\u201d\nOr as one woman recently asked Bob: \u201cIf I had a bad childhood, am I just\ntotally screwed?\u201d\nSaying something matters and saying it seals one\u2019s fate are two very\ndifferent things. In science, researchers focus on finding differences between\ngroups. We use the unfortunate words \u201cstatistically significant\u201d to note when\nthese differences seem reliable. Very small differences, however, can be\nstatistically significant; so small that they are practically meaningless. So in\naddition to saying these factors matter, we need to think about how much they\nmatter.\nSLICING UP THE HAPPINESS PIE\nThe researcher and psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky has argued, with\ncompelling evidence, that there are real answers to the question \u201cWhat makes\nus happy?\u201d In an analysis that would have made Epictetus proud, she\nexamined the degree to which our level of happiness is changeable.\nBuilding on findings from a large collection of studies, from the\nhappiness of twins raised in different families to the connection of life events\nwith well-being, she sought to discover the mutability of happiness. Previous\nresearch suggests that human beings have a \u201chappiness set point,\u201d or a\nbaseline level of happiness that is influenced largely by genetics and\npersonality traits. Regardless of how unhappy we feel through one period, or\nhow great we feel through another, we are pulled toward that set point. This\nis a robust finding that has been discussed in the psychological literature for\ndecades. In general, after something happens that causes us to feel happier or\nsadder, that boos t or dip begins to dissipate, and we return to the general\nlevel of happiness we\u2019ve always felt. For example, one year after winning\nthe lottery, those lucky lottery winners are indistinguishable from the rest of\nus when it comes to happiness.\nBut if it seems like the happiness set point means that our well-being is\nset in stone, it\u2019s worth pointing out that the glass is half full here\u2014or at least\n40 percent full. Lyubomirsky and her colleagues used research data to\nestimate that our intentional activity counts for a lot when it comes to\nhappiness. Our actions and the choices we make account for about 40 pe rcent\nof our happiness. That\u2019s a sizable chunk that is still within our control.\nThese findings reveal one of the most essential and hopeful truths about\nhuman beings: we are adaptable. We are resilient, industrious, and creative\ncreatures who can survive incredible hardship, laugh our way through tough\ntimes, and come out stronger on the other end. But there\u2019s another side to this,\nas the concept of a happiness set point and research about lottery winners\nshows: we also get used to better circumstances. Our emotional well-being\ncannot improve into infinity. We settle in. We tend to take things for granted.\nThis is a key point in the discussion about money. You might believe that\nmaking six figures or landing a new job or upgrading from your old Honda\nwill make you happy, but in short order you will have gotten used to that\nsituation, too, and your brain will move on to the next challenge, the next\ndesire. Not even lottery winners can remain euphoric forever.\nThis does not point to a flaw in the human character, but to a biological\nfact: we meet all experiences, positive and negative, on the same\npsychological and neurological playing field in our brain. Here the science\ndove tails with a central tenet of Stoicism and Buddhism, as well as many\nother spiritual traditions: the way we feel in life is determined only in part by\nwhat happens around us, and to a great extent by what happens inside of us.\nDavid Foster Wallace, in his Kenyon commencement speech that we\nquoted earlier, noted what modern Western culture (though it applies to\nothers as well) has done to these mental playing fields we all have,\nproviding us:\nextraordinary wealth and comfort and personal freedom. The\nfreedom to be lords of our tiny skull-sized kingdoms, alone at the center\nof all creation. This kind of freedom has much to recommend it. But of\ncourse there are all different kinds of freedom, and the kind that is most\nprecious you will not hear much talked about in the great outside world\nof winning and achieving and displaying. The really important kind of\nfreedom involves attention, and awareness, and discipline, and effort,\nand being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them,\nover and ove r, in myriad petty little unsexy ways, every day.\nTHE ENGINE OF A GOOD LIFE\nLeo DeMarco, the high school teacher, had four children. Three of them\ncontinue to participate in the Study. In 2016 his daughter Katherine visited\nour offices for an interview and a series of assessments of her physical\nhealth and her approach to navigating emotional challenges. During these\nvisits, which typically took about half a day, we asked participants to share\nmemories of a difficult or low moment in their lives. These experiences are\nilluminating from both a human and a scientific point of view, since low\nmoments are often formative and also give us some indication of how people\ncope with difficulties. When we asked Katherine to share a low moment, she\nwrote about the following experience:\nWhen my husband and I were trying to become parents for the first\ntime, I had four miscarriages in a relatively short period of time. This\nwas probably the first time in my life that I felt that things were out of\nmy control. There is the saying that you learn more from failure than you\ndo from success, and looking back on this time is when I learned that. It\ntested me and my husband, and I remember being aware that we needed\nto be on the same page as a couple so the desire for becoming a family\ndid not become all-consuming in our lives. This was a period that\nbrought a lot of sadness to me and my husband. But I also look back to it\nas a time that we learned to really be a team when the going got tough.\nWe also consciously chose to not let the experience of trying to start a\nfamily take over our lives. We had chosen each other as partners and we\nneeded to take care of each other, with or without children.\nRelationships are not just essential as stepping-stones to other things,\nand they are not simply a functional route to health and happi ness. They\nare ends in themselves. Katherine cared deeply about having a child, but she\nunderstood that nurturing her marriage was vital and important in and of\nitself, whether they reached the goal of parenthood together or not. While we\ntry as scientists to quantify their effect on us, relationships are full of rich and\nconstantly shifting momentary experiences, and this is part of what makes\nthem lively antidotes to the repetitions of material life. Other people will\nalways be somewhat elusive and mysterious, and that keeps relationships\ninteresting and worthy of close attention regardless of their immediate utility.\n\u201cLove by its very nature,\u201d the philosopher Hannah Arendt wrote, \u201cis\nunworldly.\u201d\nBecause of their centrality in our daily experience, relationships are a\npowerful and pragmatic part of life\u2019s puzzle. That pragmatic value has gone\nunderappreciated in modern times. Relationships are the foundation of our\nlives, intrinsic to everything we do and everything we are. Even things like\nincome and achievement that on first glance seem unconnected to\nrelationships can in practice be hard to separate from them. What would\nachievement mean if there was no one around to appreciate it? What would\nincome mean if there was no one we could share it with, no social\nenvironment to give it meaning?\nThe engine of a good life is not the self, as John Marsden believed, but\nrather our connection to others, as Leo DeMarco\u2019s life demonstrates. The\nmovements of the engine are those feelings inside us that our ancestors\npassed down, from the biggest heartbreaks to the subtle sensations of\ncamaraderie to the sadness of loss to the exhilarations of romantic love; or as\nJon Kabat-Zinn called it, borrowing a line from Zorba the Greek, \u201cthe full\ncatastrophe.\u201d It\u2019s there that the good l ife happens, in the real-time, momentary\nexperience of connection.\nYou might be thinking right now, Okay, sure, but how? How do I change\nmy relationships for the better? I can\u2019t just snap my fingers. What would\nchange even look like? Where do I start?\nChanging your life\u2014especially your habits of daily living\u2014can be\nchallenging. Many of us start out with the best of intentions to improve our\nlives, only to be overwhelmed by the force of our well-worn mental habits\nand the momentum of the culture we live in. It\u2019s tempting when confronting\nthe complexity of life to say, I\u2019ve tried, but I just cannot figure this out. I\u2019ll\njust go with the flow.\nWe see it all the time in our clinical practices. When a person steers in\none direction for much of their lives, and that path feels less than full, they\nfind it difficult to open themselves to the possibility that a different, fruitful\npath actually exists.\nKatherine\u2019s situation could have easily spiraled downward. She was\nable to recognize what was outside of her control\u2014whether she could carry\na pregnancy to term\u2014and what was within her control\u2014how she could\nnurture her relationship with her husband. They were able to maintain a close\nand forgiving relationship throughout this trial in their life. Luckily, Katherine\ndid eventually become pregnant and give birth to a son, whom she referred to\nas her \u201cMiracle Baby.\u201d But even before that final outcome, Katherine had\nwon an important battle. She\u2019d faced a difficult challenge head-on, made\ngood choices about how she would respond to it, and turned her attention\ntoward nurturing the relationship that was most affected and that would help\nget her through her ordeal.\nThe lives in the Harvard Study and many other studies tell us that every\nlife takes twists and turns and that the choices we make matter. These lives\nare evidence that rich possibilities to improve emotional wellbeing are\navailable at every stage and in every situation of life.\nThe chapters that follow contain a lot of research and personal stories,\nand we hope, particularly in these stories, that you will recognize parts of\nyourself and the people you care about. We also hope that these stories of\nmistakes and redemption, of both disconnection and love, will encourage you\nto reflect on the similarities in your own life, to think about areas that are\ngoing well for you, and areas that you might like to improve. Each of us has a\nstorehouse of experience to draw on that can point us in the direction of\nhappiness.\nWe begin with a wide lens, a kind of satellite view of the human lifespan.\nLocating yourself on this map will help get you started. Because before you\ncan get where you\u2019re going, you first have to know where you are.\n  3  \nRELATIONSHIPS ON THE WINDING\nROAD OF LIFE\nOur destiny is frequently met in the very paths we take to avoid it.\nJean de La Fontaine\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1975\nCan you tell us the life issues that have faced you after age 50 that did not seem so important\nwhen you were younger? How have you tried to master these issues?\nAs Wes Travers was approaching his 60s, he found himself in a\nreflective mood. Looking back on his life, he was trying to square his past\nexperiences with the man he was now. How did he get to this place? What\nevents were pivotal? One event in particular kept coming back to him, though\nhe had only the barest memory of it: when he was seven years old his father\npacked a small bag, walked out the front door of the family\u2019s third-floor\ntenement apartment in the West End of Boston, and never came back. Wes, his\nmother, and his three siblings had no idea how they would make a living\nwithout him, but they also felt a certain relief. When each child was a\ntoddler, their father was gentle and attentive. But as they grew, he changed.\nHe became violent and short-tempered and often brutally beat the older\nchildren, sometimes until they bled. He came home drunk in the middle of the\nnight. He was unfaithful to Wes\u2019s mother. After he left, a new and welcome\npeace settled in the home. But so did a new set of struggles and financial\nresponsibilities for the children, who were plunged into adult worries way\ntoo soon. His father\u2019s absence affected everything about Wes\u2019s formative\nyears.\n\u201cI wonder what my life would have been like if he\u2019d stuck around,\u201d Wes\ntold the Study later. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would have been better or worse, but I\nthink about it.\u201d\nWhen the Harvard Study met Wes at the age of 14, his life had already\nbeen a long sequence of challenges. His posture was a little stooped, and he\nsuffered from strabismus, a condition that caused one of his eyes to wander.\nBecause of his shyness and difficulty putting his thoughts into words, he\nstruggled to tell the Harvard Study exactly what his life was like, but he\nmanaged to provide a basic picture. School was difficult for him. He\ncouldn\u2019t focus, he daydreamed, and he got bad grades in just about every\nsubject. When asked, What\u2019s your ambition in life? Wes said, \u201cTo be a\ncook.\u201d\nLike most of us at that age (or really any age), Wes had a hard time seeing\nbeyond his present experience. Overwhelmed by his current troubles, he had\nno plans and little hope for his future. But the road he would take was not yet\ndecided. If we could go back now and show his teen self what was to come,\nhe would be very surprised how his life turned out. As we\u2019ll see, it was not\nat all as he expected.\nTHE MAP AND THE TERRITORY\nOne of the advantages of a lifetime-spanning longitudinal study is that it\ncan be used to map the entire road a person took over the course of their life.\nThis allows events and challenges to be seen in the flow of everything that\ncame before and after. We can trace the lefts and rights, the dead ends, the\nhills and valleys, and get a sense of the longer journey. Not just what\nhappened, but how one thing may have led to another, and why. There is a\nstorylike quality to these kinds of records. It\u2019s hard to read them and not feel\nsomething for the participants. Which is as it should be; first and foremost\nthese are records of personal adventures in being human. When these\nadventures are combined with hundreds of others and translated carefully\ninto numbers, however, they become the raw material of science, revealing\nnot just lives, but patterns of life.\nIf you were to place your life\u2019s timeline alongside the timelines of\neveryone else reading this book , a set of patterns similar to those of the\nHarvard Study participants would emerge. Your life would be unique in\nsome of its specifics, as would everyone\u2019s, but striking similarities would\nemerge across gender, culture, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and\nsocioeconomic background. Wes had an abusive father, but for you it might\nhave been tensions in your parents\u2019 marriage that left you feeling deep\nanxiety, or a learning disability that led to bullying and fear at school. These\nshared human experiences and repeating patterns of life remind us that\nregardless of how solitary our own struggles and challenges feel in the\nmoment, there are others who have gone through similar things in the past,\nand others going through them at this very moment. In this way, the outwardly\nemotionless material of science can have a very moving effect: it can remind\nus that we are not alone.\nAnd of course, the other thing we all share is the ever-changing nature of\nour lives, and even of ourselves. Often these changes are so gradual that we\ncan\u2019t see them. Our perception is that we are like an unchanging rock in a\nstream as the world flows around us. But that perception is mistaken. We are\nforever changing from what we are into what we will be.\nThis chapter is about taking a bird\u2019s-eye view of these patterns, and that\nwinding path of change. Stepping back and considering the big picture\nilluminates aspects of our own experience\u2014how we are changing and what\nwe can expect\u2014and also what others are going through. Life looks different\nat age 20 than it does at age 50 or age 80. That old aphorism, \u201cWhere you\nstand depends on where you sit,\u201d is apt. How we see the world depends on\nour vantage point.\nThis is a first, basic step that we use as therapists and interviewers when\nwe\u2019re getting to know someone. If we sit down with a person, and they are\n35, we have a few good guesses about which twists and turns have passed\nfor them, and which might still be ahead. Nobody  fits the model perfectly.\nLife is too interesting for that. But by considering a person\u2019s stage in life, we\ncan jump-start the process of understanding their experience. The same effort\nis useful for any person in your life, and even for yourself. Knowing that\nyou\u2019re not alone, that there are predictable challenges that many people face,\nmakes living ever-so-slightly easier.\nWhen we asked Study participants what they thought was most valuable\nabout taking part in an eighty-year study, many of them said that it gave them\nan oppor tunity to take stock of their life at regular intervals. Wes was one of\nthese participants. He mentioned more than once that devoting a few moments\nto reflect on how he felt and what his life was like helped him to appreciate\nwhat he already had, and to see what he wanted. The good news is that you\ndon\u2019t need to be part of a study to do this. It only takes a little effort and a\nlittle self-reflection. We hope this chapter will point the way.\nYOUR OWN MINI-HARVARD STUDY\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen a picture of your mother or father as a young adult,\nyou know how startling it can be. They seem like people we might have met\nalong the road rather than the parents who created us. They often appear less\nburdened, more carefree, and somehow\u2026 different. Pictures of ourselves at\na younger age can be even more startling. We might look at our younger\nselves and feel a sweet nostalgia, or maybe a sense of wistfulness, as we\u2019re\nconfronted with our physical changes, our abandoned dreams, our once\ntreasured beliefs. For others, like Wes, looking back at a younger age\nreminds one of sorrows and challenges that are difficult to revisit.\nThese impressions point to areas of our lives that are important to us, and\nthey can be turned into something helpful using a simple but powerful\nexercise we developed for our Lifespan Research Foundation\n(www.lifespanresearch.org). This involves a bit of personal research, but if\nyou\u2019re game, come play along.\nFind a photograph of yourself when you were about half as old as you are\nnow. If you\u2019re under 35, go back to the time you were starting adult life.\nReally, any photo from when you were a lot younger will do. Don\u2019t just\nimagine that time, try to find an actual photo. The lively reality of a\nphotograph, the details of the place and time, the expression on your face, all\nhelp evoke the feelings that make this exercise worthwhile.\nNow take a close look at yourself in that photograph. After you stop\nwondering why you were so into brown clothes, or marveling at your weight\nor your once luxurious hair, try to place yourself back in the moment when\nthe picture was taken. Really look: spend several minutes (a long time!) just\ntaking it in and remembering that era of your life. What were you thinking\nabout back then? What were you worried about? What were you hopeful\nabout? What were your plans? Who were you spending time with? What was\nmost important to you? And perhaps the most difficult question to face: When\nyou think of yourself at that time, what do y ou regret?\nIt helps to put your answers to these questions into words. Jot down a\nfew notes, be as detailed as you like. If you have somebody  close to you\nwho\u2019s curious about this book  you\u2019re reading, consider asking them to find a\nphotograph of themselves and to do this with you. (As longitudinal\nresearchers, we suggest that if you have a printed photo, consider using it as\na book mark, and when you\u2019re finished, leaving it here in this book , along\nwith your notes. Someone you know might get something out of it in the future\nas they try the exercise themselves; these records of our loved ones\u2019 past\nlives and thoughts are rare, and valuable.)\nIN THE FOOTSTEPS OF HISTORY (AND\nBEYOND)\nThe Harvard Study is by no means the first effort to extract useful data\nfrom lifetimes of human experiences. For millennia people have been trying\nto unlock the secrets of human life by looking at its patterns, and they have\nanalyzed these patterns in all kinds of ways, often by categorizing them into\nstages.\nThe Greeks had various versions of life\u2019s stages. Aristotle described\nthree. Hippoc rates, seven. By the time Shakespeare wrote about the \u201cseven\nages of man\u201d in his famous \u201call the world\u2019s a stage\u201d soliloquy in As You Like\nIt, the idea of life happening in stages was likely familiar to his audience.\nShakespeare himself probably learned them in grammar school.\nIslamic teachings also mention seven stages of existence. Buddhist\nteachings illustrate the ten stages along the path to enlightenment using the\nmetaphor of ox herding. Hinduism identifies four stages of life, or Ashramas,\nand these echo many modern psychological life stage theories: the student,\nwho learns about the world, the hous eholder, who develops a calling and\ntakes care of his or her family, the retiree, who retreats from family life, and\nthe ascetic, who commits to the pursuit of greater spirituality.\nScience has its own perspectives on the biological and psychological\ndevelopment of the human being. But for a very long time, science focused\nalmost entirely on early childhood development. Until recently,\npsychological textbook s had only short sections on the development of\nadults. Once someone reached adulthood, the thinking went, that person was\nfully formed; the only important change was that of decline, both physical and\nmental.\nIn the 1960s  and 1970s , this perspective began to change. George\nVaillant, the director of the Harvard Study from 1972 to 2004, was one of\nmany scientists who began to see adulthood as a period of important flux and\noppor tunity. It\u2019s hard to look at the Harvard Study\u2019s longitudinal data and\ncome to any other conclusion. There were also new discoveries about the\n\u201cplasticity\u201d of the human brain showing that decreased brain volume and\ndeclining brain function are not the only changes adults experience with age;\npositive changes also unfold throughout the lifespan.\nIn short, the most recent science shows that no matter where you are in\nyour life, you are changing, and not just for the worse; positive change is\npossible.\nTIMING IS (HALF OF) EVERYTHING\nWe find two perspectives particularly helpful in making sense of the life\ncycle. The first, introduced by Erik and Joan Erikson, framed adult\ndevelopment as a series of key challenges that we all face as we grow older.\nThe second is a theory by Bernice Neugarten about the social and cultural\nexpectations around the timing of the events in our lives.\nThe Eriksons identified life stages based on cognitive, biological, social,\nand psychological challenges, and they framed these as crises; we either do\nor we don\u2019t meet a particular challenge successfully. And at every point in\nlife we encounter at least one and often more than one of these challenges.\nFor example, in young adulthood we are faced with the challenge of\nestablishing intimacy or becoming isolated. During this period, we find\nourselves asking, Will I find someone to love or will I remain alone? In\nmidlife we are faced with the challenge of establishing a sense of\ngenerativity or feeling a sense of stagnation (Will I be creative and contribute\nto the development of the next generation, or will I be stuck in a self-centered\nrut?). These \u201cEriksonian\u201d stages have been used by psychologists and\ntherapists for decades to put life\u2019s hurdles into a useful context.\nBernice Neugarten, another pioneer in the study of how adults change,\nhas a different take. Rather than defining life completely by a \u201cdevelopment\nclock,\u201d Neugarten has argued that society and culture shape development in\nimportant ways. Our upbringing and influences (friends, news, social media,\nmovies) create an informal \u201csocial clock\u201d or schedule of events that are\nsuppos ed to occur at specific times in our lives. Social clocks differ from\nculture to culture, and from generation to generation. Key events like leaving\none\u2019s childhood home, entering into a committed, long-term relationship, and\nhaving children each have their own cultural value and places in the timeline,\nand we experience these important events as either \u201con-time\u201d or \u201coff-time,\u201d\nbased on whether we think we\u2019re meeting society\u2019s expectations. Many who\nidentify as LGBTQ+ experience themselves as \u201coff-time,\u201d because some of\nthe events used as markers reflect traditional heterosexual lifestyles.\nNeugarten said that she was herself \u201coff-time\u201d in important ways. She\nmarried early and began her professional career late. In her theory, \u201con-time\u201d\nevents help us feel that our lives are on track, and \u201coff-time\u201d events create\nworry that we\u2019re not on track. We worry not because off-time events are\ninherently stressful, but because they don\u2019t fit others\u2019 (and our own)\nexpectations.\nThese two ideas\u2014life as a sequence of challenges, and variation in the\ncultural importance of events and their timing\u2014go a long way toward\nexplaining how we feel about ourselves, and how we engage with the world\nat different points in our lives.\nBut there is another way to look at the winding road of life: through the\nlens of our relationships. Because human life is essentially social, when\nmajor changes deeply affect us, our relationships are usually a central\nelement of what\u2019s in flux. When a teenager moves away from home, what is it\nthat produces most of the powerful feelings involved: living in a new place,\nor making new friendships and being away from parents? When two people\nmarry, is it the ceremony, the event, or the bond  that changes their lives? As\nwe develop and change over time, it is our relationships that most often\nreflect back to us who we really are, and how far we\u2019ve come on our life\npath.\nA good life requires growth and change. This change is not an automatic\nprocess that occurs as we age. What we experience, what we endure, and\nwhat we do all affect the trajectory of growth. Relationships are a central\nplayer in this growth process. Other people challenge and enrich us. With\nnew relationships come new expectations, new troubles, new hills to climb,\nand often we\u2019re not \u201cready.\u201d Very few people, for example, are ever\nperfectly ready to become a parent. But becoming a parent, and being\nresponsible for a tiny human being, has a way of making most of us ready. It\npushes us. Somehow we live up to what we have to do, relationship by\nrelationship, stage by stage, and in the process, we change. We grow.\nWhat follows is a short roadmap of these life stages, as seen through the\nrelationships that make them what they are. Compared to the vast literature\navailable on the human life cycle, this is like a map drawn on a napkin. If you\nfind it helpful, you can explore the references we\u2019ve put in the notes at the\nback of the book , and take an even deeper dive. You might recognize yourself\nand some of your own challenges in what follows, and some of it might not\napply at all; that\u2019s the case for everyone. But even if you don\u2019t recognize\nyourself at every stage, you might recognize people you know and love.\nA LIFETIME OF ADULT RELATIONSHIPS: A\nMINI ROADMAP\nADOLESCENCE (12\u201319) : Walking the Tightrope\nLet\u2019s start with that infamous life stage, the teenage years. This is a time\nof rapid growth but also of contradiction and confusion. An adolescent\u2019s life\nburns with intensity as they ascend into adulthood. If we have teenagers in\nour lives, their path from childhood to adult life can seem precarious\u2014for\nthem and for us. Richard Bromfield captured the feeling of loving a teenager\nwell when he described the \u201ctightropes\u201d that they string for their parents and\nthe people around them. A teenager needs us to:\nHold but  don\u2019 t baby ;\nadmire but don\u2019 t embarrass;\nguide but don\u2019 t control;\nrelease but don\u2019 t abandon.\nHowever unstable this stage might feel to the people around them, it feels\neven more precarious for teens themselves. They need to accomplish some\nbig tasks as they move toward adulthood, chief among them figuring out their\nown identity. This involves experimenting with new kinds of relationships\nand changing existing relationships, sometimes dramatically. Through their\nencounters with others, teenagers develop new views of themselves, the\nworld, and other people.\nFrom the inside, adolescence feels both exciting and scary. Possibilities\nabound, but so do anxieties as teenagers find themselves confronted with\nprofound questions like:\n \nWhat kind of person am I becoming? Who do I want to be like, and who\ndo I not want to be like?\nWhat should I do w ith my life?\nAm I proud of who I am and who I am becoming? How much should I\ntry to be like somebody  I respect?\nWill I be able to make my own way in the world? Or will I always\ndepend on the support of others?\nHow do I know if my friends really like me? Can I count on them to\nhave my back?\nI\u2019m having intense sexual and romantic feelings and they are blowing\nmy mind. How can I manage this new intensity of intimacy and\nattraction?\nAt some point in the teen years, parental figures usually fall off their\npedestals and become ordinary (sometimes boring) adults. This creates a\ntemporary vacuum in the role model department. Parental figures remain\nnecessary for support (food, rides, money), but the real action is with\nfriendships, which are exciting, if sometimes volatile, and can involve new\nlevels of connection and intimacy. The question, \u201cWho am I?\u201d is central, and\nteenagers often find themselves discovering who they are together, trying on\nnew ways of being that include everything from styles of clothing to political\nbeliefs to gender identity. For many people, close friends are never as central\nas they are when we\u2019re teenagers.\nFrom the outside, adolescence can look like a bundle of contradictions.\nTo a middle-aged parent, it may look like Invasion of the Body Snatchers\u2014\nthat once adorable and adoring child is now a moody  teen who is at one\nmoment childlike and clingy and in the next moment a disdainful know-it-all.\nThe clever title of Anthony Wolf\u2019s popu lar parenting book  sums up a parental\nperspective on this period: Get Out of My Life, but First Could You Drive\nMe and Cheryl to the Mall? Grandparents who watched this transition in\ntheir own children might have a different perspective. To them, this same\nteenager may represent the joyous future of the world, and the grandchild\u2019s\nshifting sense of self may seem like necessary experimentation.\nAll of these perspectives make sense. Just as the scenery changes on a\nlong road trip, when you look out at the world, what you see depends on\nwhere you are in the life cycle. Taking another person\u2019s life perspective into\naccount, taking it to heart, is a skill that we can learn. It requires some\nimagination and some effort, especially in the face of frustration. But it can\nhelp us to spend less time complaining and criticizing and wishing that\nsomeone else were different, and more time connecting and nurturing.\nIf you are the parents, grandparents, mentor, teacher, coach, or role model\nof an adolescent, you might be asking: How can I best support them, even as\nthey seem to want to be independent? What kinds of things can we do to help\nthem emerge from this period stronger and ready for adult life? And how can\nI survive their adolescence myself?\nFirst, don\u2019t be fooled by signals of teenage bravado and claims about\nself-sufficiency. Teens need you. Some teens will show this by being clingy,\nbut others may insist that they don\u2019t need anyone. Of course, they do. In fact,\na teen\u2019s relationships with adults may be more crucial than at any other time\nin life. Research tells us that there are advantages for adolescents who\nbecome more autonomous while still remaining connected to their parents.\nOne participant in the Student Council Study (the longitudinal research\nlinked to the Harvard Study conducted with graduates of three colleges in the\nNortheast) was able to look back as an adult and see the emotional puzzle of\nher teen years more clearly. After she\u2019d become a mother of four herself, she\nreflected on the way her perspective of her mother had changed, and told\nresearchers:\nThere is that standard joke of Mark Twain\u2019s about how much his\nfather learned between the time the boy was fifteen and twenty. It\u2019s that\nway with me and my mother. But of course the change was in me, not in\nher. For a long time, I sort of clung. I was very anxious when my mother\nwas around, mainly, I guess, because I was afraid she was going to be\nliving my life for me instead of letting me be myself. Now I sort of\nrealize how perfectly marvelous she is.\nPresence matters. The adults an adolescent interacts with as well as the\ncultural figures in today\u2019s saturated media environment provide models for\nwhat life is, and what it can be. So the availability of in-person, real-time\nrole models is extremely important. Life may be taking place increasingly\nonline (more on that in Chapter Five), but physical presence still really\nmatters. The template for how an adolescent imagines life is heavily\ninfluenced by peers, teachers, coaches, parents, the parents of friends (an\nunderappreciated group of role models), and\u2014a s in Wes Travers\u2019s case\u2014\nolder siblings.\nWES\u2019S SIBLINGS STEP UP\nSeven years after his father left, Wes Travers became a participant in the\nHarvard Study, at the age of 14. When asked in what way the kids\u2019 father\ninfluenced their lives now that he no longer lived with them, Wes\u2019s mother\nsaid that the children\u2019s father had no interest in any of them, and the feeling\nwas mutual. While his absence strained the household in material ways, it\nalso brought the family closer together. In lieu of a father, the children now\nlooked after each other, each contributing to the household income\u2014an\naverage of $13.68 per person, per week\u2014and sometimes chipping in extra to\nbuy one sibling a needed pair of shoes or a coat or a book  bag. As the\nyoungest child, and being somewhat meek, Wes had been cared for by the\nothers and protected from having to get a job. They wanted him to go to\nschool instead. In this way, they were remembering themselves at that stage\nof life\u2014remembering how they felt having to go to work too early in life.\nThey were trying to give Wes the oppor tunity to have a longer childhood. His\nolder sister, Violet, worked as a nanny and gave Wes spending money to use\nhowever he wanted. Each year he looked forward to summer camp, which\nhis older siblings all saved up to pay for. That\u2019s what kept him out of trouble,\nhe told the Study, since among the boys he knew, living in Boston in the\nsummertime meant getting into trouble, plain and simple. He looked up to his\nolder brother, a hard worker who, Wes said, \u201cdidn\u2019t curse in the house\u201d and\nset a good example for him. An interviewer\u2019s handwritten note from the\nStudy\u2019s first conversation with the family, in 1945, captures the special place\nthat Wes had in the Travers household:\n\u201cSister Violet said that when Wesley returned home unexpectedly from\ncamp one day, her eyes filled with tears, she was so happy.\u201d\nBut Wes\u2019s siblings couldn\u2019t protect him forever. When he was 15, only\none year after the Harvard Study first visited him, he had to drop out of high\nschool to help support the family. For the next four years he worked as a\ndishwasher and busboy in various restaurants, had no consistent friends his\nage, and spent most of his free time at home. His search to be someone, to be\nsomething, had been diverted before it really began. Later he would tell the\nStudy, \u201cThose were hard years. I felt like nothing.\u201d\nWes went from being a somewhat sheltered child to being plunged\nheadlong into adult responsibility, working long hours with very little\nrecreation. This meant that he was deprived of many key developmental\nadolescent experiences. He had to forge his way through days taken up by a\nmenial job, and as happens for many children in challenging circumstances,\nhe had to kick some developmental tasks down the road\u2014tasks like making\nclose friends, figuring out his identity, and learning how to connect with\nothers in more intimate ways. He had a low sense of self-worth and life\noffered him few oppor tunities to explore who he was.\nThen, when he was 19, the United States entered the Korean War. Unsure\nof what his life would become, and seeing no future for himself in Boston,\nWes did something many of the men in the Harvard Study did: he joined the\nmilitary. This was both a way out of his adolescence and a way in to\nfriendships with other young men his age from other walks of life\u2014a new\nexperience for Wes. This gave him more of an oppor tunity to explore new\nroles and to ponder what he wanted out of life. After what had seemed like\nan endless period of toil, Wes had entered into a new era of development\u2014\nhis young adulthood.\nYOUNG ADULTHOOD (20\u201340) : Weaving Your Own Safety Net\nPeggy Keane, Second Generation Study participant, age 53:\nI was 26 years old and engaged to one of the nicest men on the\nplanet. I felt completely adored and loved. As the wedding date grew\ncloser, I felt panicked and knew, in my gut and heart, that I should not be\ngetting married. The truth was, I knew I was gay. The plans and my own\nfear of that reality prevented me from speaking up. Immediately\nfollowing the wedding, I quickly began to shut down. I looked for\nreasons to blame it on my husband, reasons why this marriage would not\nwork. In a matter of months, divorce papers were filed. This whole\nevent is a low point. Not because I came to terms with being gay, but\nbecause I caused this incredible man a great deal of pain. I caused my\nfamily such grief. I felt completely embarrassed. Again, not about being\ngay, but for not figuring out who I was soone r and for all the grief I\ncaused two families and so many friends who supported our\nrelationship and traveled from so far to celebrate this wedding.\nThis was a lonely experience for Peggy in the early years of her young\nadulthood. H er parents, Henry and Rosa, whom we met in Chapter One, were\ndevout Catholics, and this event strained her relationship with them to its\nlimit. She felt lost and isolated.\nIf adolescence is the first time we begin asking Who am I?, then young\nadulthood is the time potential answers to that question are really put to the\ntest. We typically become more independent from our family of origin, and\nthis means creating new bonds to fill that vacuum. Work and financial\nindependence become central, and the habits we acquire around balancing\nwork and life can stay with us the rest of our lives. Knitting all of this\ntogether is the desire and need for intimate attachments that aren\u2019t just about\nromance, but about sharing life and responsibilities with someone we know\nwe can lean on.\nFrom the outside, young adults can appear to members of their family of\norigin as detached from family relationships as they focus on work and seek\nto build emotional intimacy with romantic partners as well as families of\ntheir own. Parents might look at their children in this stage and mistake this\nnew focus for a lack of caring, or selfishness. Someone in late life might look\nat a young adult with envy, and maybe even a little pity that young people are\noverstressed and can\u2019t see the beauty and possibilities of the time and\nchoices they have. Youth is wasted on t he young , as the saying goes.\nFrom the inside, young adulthood can provok e anxiety as we become\nresponsible for ourselves, while at the same time our path in life is uncertain.\nYoung adults can also experience intense feelings of loneliness. For a young\nadult struggling to find meaningful work, to find friends and a connection to a\nlarger community, or to find love, seeing others succeed in these efforts can\nbe painful.\nYoung adults often ask themselves questions like:\n \nWho am I?\nAm I capable of doing what I want with my life?\nAm I on the right path?\nWhat do I stand for?\nWill I ever find the right person to love? Will anyone love me?\nTwo of the great sources of excitement in young adulthood\u2014b ecoming\nmore self-sufficient and getting ahead in the world\u2014c an also be traps. To be\nsure, accomplishing personal goals or career milestones is enlivening and\nbuilds confidence, but it\u2019s easy to get so wrapped up in the pursuit of\nachievement that equally enlivening personal relationships fall by the\nwayside.\nThe drive for self-sufficiency can turn into social isolation. Close\nfriendships really matter in young adulthood. Even one good friend who\nunderstands what we\u2019re going through, someone we can confide in and who\ncan help us blow off steam, can make a big difference in our lives. Family\nstill matters, though there\u2019s great variation around the world in how young\nadults relate to their families of origin. In many countries in Asia and Latin\nAmerica, young adults often continue living with parents until and even after\nmarriage. By contrast, young adults in the United States often find themselves\nliving hundreds or thousands of miles away from their childhood homes.\nPhysical separation isn\u2019t necessarily a negative, but keeping parents and\nsiblings in our emotional loop can ease the trials of young adulthood, and\ngive us confidence to take risks.\nAnd finally, romantic relationships and committed intimacy give us a new\nfeeling of home and provide an important haven of confiding and trust.\nWES GETS AHEAD IN ONE WAY, FALLS\nBEHIND IN ANOTHER\nWhen a Harvard Study interviewer tried to contact Wes in his mid-20s,\nhe was nowhere to be found. When the Study caught up to his mother, who\nwas still living in the same Boston tenement, she told the Study interviewer\nthat after serving in the Korean War, Wes was recruited to work in some kind\nof government organization and was living overseas. The interviewer was, at\nfirst, suspicious.\n\u201cMother claims Wes is doing work for the government overseas,\u201d the\ninterviewer wrote in his field notes. \u201cDifficult to know if this is something\nWes made up to cover his absence, or if he really is working for the\ngovernment. I would guess the former.\u201d\nWes was, in fact, hired by the U.S. government to help train foreign\narmies after his service in the war, and worked all over the world, from\nWestern Europe to Latin America. He returned from his duties when he was\n29 years old with an entirely different perspective on life, culture, and the\nworld in general. According to his sister, Wes \u201csaved every penny\u201d while he\nwas working internationally and was fortunate to have some military benefits\nand few financial pressures when he came back to the States. He was able to\nbuy a house for his mother, and moved her out of the tenement their family\nhad lived in his entire life.\nWes was handy and capable with house repairs, so he started helping\nfriends and neighbors with various projects for a little extra money.\nHe was single at that time, dating no one in particular, and told the Study\ninterviewers that he was not inclined to get married. This is an inflection\npoint for many young adults: Do I want to commit myself to another person?\nAm I ready? We know from later records that Wes was feeling nervous about\nclose commitments. He had his parents\u2019 difficult marriage in mind, and he\u2019d\nalso watched his older siblings\u2019 marriages encounter serious challenges, so\nhe made a conscious decision to avoid romantic attachments. He spent most\nof his time fixing up the house he\u2019d bou ght for his mother.\nWes had had a challenging adolescence, but he was now well on his way\nin the world. He was propelled into adult responsibilities at a young age,\njoined the military to escape, had lived his 20s entirely in other countries.\nNow that he was back, he was, in a way, navigating adolescent and early\nadult challenges he had never fully faced. He pursued things to see if they\nwould be of interest to him; some were, some weren\u2019t. He joined a softball\nteam, a woodw orking club, and met new friends. To observers he was\ncertainly \u201coff-time\u201d and seemed uncertain of his path in life. But in his own\nway, he was taking on important developmental tasks and challenges. He was\nliving life at his own pace.\nFAILURE TO LAUNCH\nAs Wes\u2019s case shows, the challenges of adolescence don\u2019t necessarily\nend at a certain age. Just because you turn 18 or 25 or even 30 doesn\u2019t mean\nthat you are finished with the developmental tasks associated with the\nteenage years, and that your transition to adulthood is now complete. The\neffort to make one\u2019s own way in the world continues, and some important\nemotional or career developments can get postponed as other things take\npriority. This timing is a little different for everyone, and as society changes,\nthe paths through young adulthood have become more and more varied\u2014\nthere are all kinds of possibilities, and all kinds of dangers.\nIn modern times, particularly in societies that are relatively well-off,\nthere is a kind of extended adolescence that often continues through the 20s.\nJeffrey Arnett has labeled this period \u201cemerging adulthood,\u201d  in which young\nadults may remain largely dependent on their parents, casting around for their\nplace in the world. The development of some young adults seems to stall\nduring this time, as they never venture very far out from under the wings of\ntheir parents.\nThe path to responsible adulthood has become very complicated, and\nnavigating it is not easy.\nIn Spain there is a group of young adults called the NiNi generation (ni\nestudia, ni trabaja: \u201cthey don\u2019t study; they don\u2019t work\u201d), who live at home.\nIn the U.K. and other countries, there is an actual public policy designation\nfor this subset of the popu lation: NEETs (not in education, employment, or\ntraining).\nIn Japan, there is the even more concerning phenomenon of hikikomori,\nwhich translates roughly to \u201cpulling inward\u201d or \u201cbeing confined.\u201d This is a\nslightly different issue, more common in young men than young women, that\ncombines the inactivity of NiNis and NEETs with arrested psychological and\nsocial development, an intense social aversion, and sometimes internet\naddiction through gaming and social media platforms.\nIn the United States the phenomenon is not so ubiquitous that there is a\npopu lar name for it, but young adults do continue to live with parents in\nconsiderable numbers and many are struggling to identify a path forward in\ntheir lives. In 2015, one third of U.S. adults aged 18\u201334 lived with their\nparents, and about one quarter of those, or 2.2 million young adults, were\nneither attending school nor working.\nThese young men and women are not living independently, and this can\nhamper their ability to see themselves as competent adults. A dramatic and\ncompounding effect on intimate relationships often follows as an increasing\ndependency on parents further stifles the development of self-confidence. But\nit\u2019s not always their fault. The modern economy is unforgiving. Even young\nadults who go to college and train for a particular profession might emerge\nwith large debts and no assets into an economy that doesn\u2019t need them.\nParents often provide the safety net.\nThis is mainly a phenomenon in developed nations and within wealthy\ngroups. By contrast, in developing nations and in less advantaged groups in\ndeveloped countries, children may begin working and supporting their family\nat 15 or  even younger, just as Wes Travers had don e.\nCOMPETENCY AND INTIMACY\nWhile Wes had delayed some of the tasks of adolescent development into\nhis later years, he was quite far ahead of his peers in establishing\ncompetency. He joined the military at 19 and pursued difficult training,\nearned promotions, and parachuted into enemy territory. This once shy child\ndeveloped skills as a young adult that bolstered his self-confidence.\nNormally humble and self-deprecating, he uncharacteristically boasted to the\nStudy at age 34: \u201cYou could drop me in any environment anywhere in the\nworld and I believe I could survive, and thrive.\u201d When he returned to the\nStates he was unafraid of attempting any hands-on task. He taught himself\ncarpentry and built his own house. The house he bought for his mother and\nsister with his earnings gave him a feeling of purpose and pride; he was\nreturning some of the care they gave him in the way he knew how.\nIn general, as young adults we are trying to figure out how to establish\nourselves in the two big domains of life\u2014work and family. Some people\nmanage to develop competence in both work and family spheres\nsimultaneously, others flourish more in one sphere.\nFinding this balance is a developmental challenge, and the possible\nsolutions have varied across gender. Wes\u2019s family is a good example. When\nhe came out of the military, he moved into adulthood with the affection and\nsupport of his sister and mother; with this foundation and the right\ncircumstances, his sense of competence blossomed. But in the 1950s  and\n1960s , the same type of support and encouragement was not available to his\nsister. Even in the twenty-first century, gender-based norms continue to shape\nyoung adult development, both in work and family life. Despite advances,\nwomen in many cultures still carry much of the burden of duties around\nchildren and the home. This unbalanced division of labor may slow or even\nhinder young women\u2019s development and realization of goals, while allowing\nmen greater freedom to pursue career development.\nAlthough Wes had the support of his sister and mother, he had no\nsignificant intimate relationships through his young adulthood. He had come a\nlong way in his sense of competency and control, and he had developed a lot\nof casual friendships and an active social life. However, the records show\nsome reluctance, uncertainty, and loneliness in Wes\u2019s romantic life. He had\nno one to confide in, no one to share his days with. Although others might not\nfeel the need for romance in their lives, Wes felt the absence of romance as a\nmajor void, and he didn\u2019t know what to do about it. He could build a house,\nbut he couldn\u2019t figure out how to build a home.\nMIDLIFE (41\u201365) : Stepping Beyond the Self\n1964 H arvard Study Questionnaire for John Marsden, age 43:\nQ: Please use the last page(s) to answer all the questions we should have asked, if we\u2019d\nasked about the things that matter most to you.\nA:\n1. I\u2019m growing old. Realize for the first time the reality of death.\n2. Feel I may not achieve what I wanted.\n3. Not sure I know how to bring up children. I thought I did.\n4. Tensions at work are severe.\nAt some point in life we realize that we\u2019re no longer young. The\ngeneration before us is growing old and we can see (and feel) the beginnings\nof that same process in our own bodies. If we have children, our roles in\ntheir lives are changing as they become their own people, and we worry\nabout what their future will bring. Friendships\u2014so important in adolescence\nand young adulthood\u2014m ay take a backseat to responsibilities. We may be\nproud of our accomplishments and happy with where we are in some ways,\nand in other ways wish we\u2019d done things differently. Our lives seem to be\nshedding some of the possibilities they once had. At the same time, we\u2019ve\nlearned a great deal, and many of us would not choose to go back.\nFrom the outside, the middle years often look stable and predictable. To\nyounger generations, even boring. To older adults looking back, midlife\nmight look like the prime of life\u2014the best mix of wisdom and vitality. These\nare flip sides of the same perception; when we look at a person in middle\nage who has steady work, a routine, a partner and a family, we often think,\nThis person really has it together, they\u2019re in control. Middle-aged adults\noften look at their peers this way. But the struggles of midlife aren\u2019t always\nvisible for others to see.\nFrom the inside, midlife can feel different than it looks. We may have a\nstable work and home life, and have pride in those things, but also feel more\nstressed than ever, overwhelmed with responsibilities and worry. Raising\nchildren, taking care of aging parents, and juggling the tasks of home and\nwork, middle-aged adults often find neither the oppor tunity nor the energy to\nreach out and share their worries with others. The stability and routine that\nsome of us find in midlife will feel like safety and security to one person\u2014\nI\u2019ve established myself and built a life\u2014bu t to another like stagnation. We\nmay look at how we got here and wonder if we\u2019ve chosen the right path\n(What would have happe ned if only\u2026?). And then of course, as John\nMarsden\u2019s response to the questionnaire above  makes clear, at some point\nwe begin to understand on a visceral level that our life is short. In fact, it\u2019s\nprobably more than half over. This is a bracing realization, to say the least.\nAround the middle of our lives, it\u2019s common to ask questions like:\n \nAm I doing well compared to others?\nAm I in a rut?\nAm I a good partner and parent? Do I have good relationships with my\nchildren?\nHow many years do I have left?\nDoes the life I\u2019m leading have meaning beyond myself?\nWhat people and purposes do I really care about (and how can I invest\nin them)?\nWhat else do I want to do?\nFinally, realizing that a lot of life is behind us, we might look around at\nour lives, see the limits of our abilities and the likely conclusion of the path\nwe are on, and think, Is this all there is?\nThe simple answer is no. There is more. Midlife is an inflection point,\nnot only between young and old, but also between the self-focused, inward-\nlooking way of living that many of us developed in young adulthood and a\nmore generous, outward-looking way of living. This is the most important\nand enlivening task of midlife: to expand one\u2019s focus to the world beyond the\nself.\nIn psychology, expanding our concerns and efforts beyond our own lives\nis called \u201cgenerativity\u201d and it\u2019s a key to unlocking the vibrancy and\nexcitement of midlife. Among Harvard Study participants, the happiest and\nmost satisfied adults were those who managed to turn the question \u201cWhat can\nI do for myself?\u201d into \u201cWhat can I do for the world beyond me?\u201d\nJohn F. Kennedy\u2014himself a Harvard Study participant\u2014came to\nunderstand this well in his own midlife. He offered not just political, but\nemotional and developmental guidance when, as president, he said, famously,\n\u201cAsk not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your\ncountry.\u201d\nWhen asked at the end of their lives, \u201cWhat do you wish you\u2019d done less\nof? What do you wish you\u2019d done more of?\u201d our Study participants, male and\nfemale, often referenced their middle years, and regretted having spent so\nmuch time worrying and so little time acting in a way that made them feel\nalive:\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t wasted so much time.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t procrastinated so much.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t worried so much.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d spent more time with my family.\u201d\nOne participant quipped: \u201cWell I didn\u2019t do much of anything so less\nwould be nothing!\u201d Many of these answers were given when participants\nwere in their 70s and 80s, looking back on their lives. But we don\u2019t need to\nwait till then to ask ourselves how we can best spend our time.\nRelationships are the vehicle that will allow us both to improve our lives\nand to build things that will outlive us. If we manage to do this in meaningful\nways, the question Is this all there is? will be reserved for those times we\npull out the last quart of ice cream and it feels far too light.\nWES OPENS UP IN HIS MIDDLE YEARS\nAt 40 Wes Travers had not yet married. In the late 1960s  in Boston, this\nwas unusual, or what Bernice Neugarten would have called \u201coff-time.\u201d When\nhe was 36 he\u2019d started dating a woman named Amy who was divorced and\nhad a three-year-old son. He helped raise the child, but he and Amy never\ntied the knot. They now lived together in an apartment in the South End.\nWes had applied to the Boston Police Department, and after several years\nof waiting for a position, was finally accepted.\nThis proved to be an extremely positive experience for him. He got along\nwell with his colleagues and was particularly suited to the environment. He\nnow knew people all over Boston, and said he had one of the slower\nheartbeats on the force, so in any tense situation he thought of his role as the\npeacekeeper\u2014keeping everyone calm.\nWhen Wes was 44 y ears old he asked Amy to marry him.\nSeveral years later, when a Study interviewer visited Wes for an\ninterview, she asked him about Amy, and recorded his response in her notes.\nThe passage is worth quoting at length:\nAmy, Mr. Travers\u2019 wife, is 37 years old and they were married in\n1971. S he is a Baptist and a college graduate. Mr. Travers described his\nwife as \u201cgreat\u2014a terrific person,\u201d and indicated that he really meant\nthis; it was not something he was just putting on.\nHe described the characteristics that most pleased him about his\nwife as \u201cshe is a gentle and compassionate person.\u201d He said he likes\neverything about her; that there is something about her personality that\nhe liked right away that has never gone away. He said she is the kind of\nperson who will be very sympathetic toward those who have less than\nshe does, and mentioned that one of the reasons she had gotten this\nparticular kitten for his birthday last year was that the cat had a scar on\nits head and one half-missing ear from when it was attacked by a dog.\nHe said that even though she could have chosen a healthy-looking cat, it\nwas just like her to take the one in the litter that had scars like this. He\nsaid he is somewhat like that too and he probably would have done the\nsame thing.\nHe said he could not think of anything that really bothers him about\nhis wife. He said that every once in a while they might have a spat\u2014he\ndoes not really know about what\u2014bu t it is something they just get over\nin an hour or two, and there have never been any kind of serious\ndisagreements between them. They have never been close to getting a\nseparation or a divorce. In terms of his marriage, he said \u201cit gets better\nall the time.\u201d\nIn the end, I asked the subject why they had waited so long to get\nmarried. He said, \u201cI was afraid I might be a person who was set in my\nways\u2014afraid of what I might do to her.\u201d He indicated that he did have a\ncertain amount of fear of the intimacy of marriage. However, he now\nseems to have grown with the marriage and has no such feelings or fears\nabout that anymore.\nWes had avoided a long-term partner his entire adult life, perhaps in no\nsmall part because of his early childhood experience of his parents\u2019\nmarriage. This is not unusual. We can develop ideas about ourselves and the\nworld that turn out not to be true. It took him much of his life, but with the\nhelp of a loving partner, he overcame this fear, surprising himself, and never\nlooked back.\nLATE LIFE (66+): Minding What (and Who) Matters\nIn a study done in 2003, two groups of participants\u2014on e older and one\nyounger\u2014were shown two advertisements for a new camera. Both ads\nincluded the same lovely picture of a bird, bu t the slogans were different.\nOne said: Capture those special moments.\nThe other: Capture the unexplored world.\nThe participants were asked to choose which advertisement they liked\nbest.\nThe older group chose the slogan about special moments, the younger\ngroup chose the slogan about the unexplored world.\nBut when researchers primed another group of older people by saying,\n\u201cImagine that you\u2019ll live twenty years longer than you expect to, and you\u2019ll\nbe in good health,\u201d that older group chose the ad about \u201cthe unexplored\nworld.\u201d\nThis study shows a very basic truth about aging: the amount of time we\nthink we have left on earth shapes our priorities. If we think we have a lot of\ntime, we think more about the future. If we think we have less time, we try to\nappreciate the present.\nIn late life, time is suddenly very precious. Faced with the reality of our\nown mortality, we start asking ourselves questions like:\n \nHow much time do I have left?\nHow long will I stay healthy?\nAm I losing it mentally?\nWho do I  want to spend this limited time with?\nHave I had a good e nough life? What was meaningful? What do I regret?\nFrom the outside, late life is often viewed primarily as a period of\nphysical and mental decline. To the young, old age might look like a distant\nabstraction; a state so divorced from their experience that they can\u2019t even\nimagine growing old themselves. To someone in midlife, an older person\u2019s\ndecline hits a little closer to home and might remind them of their own aging\nprocess. In contrast to these notions of decline, the wisdom of older people\nis often viewed with deep respect and honor, particularly in certain cultures.\nFrom the inside, old age is not so simple. We may be more concerned\nabout time as death approaches, but older folks are also more capable of\nappreciating that time. The fewer moments we have to look forward to in\nlife, the more valuable they become. Past grievances and preoccupations\noften dissipate, and what\u2019s left is what we have before us. The beauty of a\nsnowy day; the pride we have in our children or in the work we\u2019ve done; the\nrelationships we cherish. Despite the perception that old people are grumpy\nand cantankerous, research has shown that human beings are never so happy\nas in the late years of their lives. We get better at maximizing highs and\nminimizing lows. We feel less hassled by the little things that go wrong, and\nwe are better at knowing when something is important and when it\u2019s not. The\nvalue of positive experiences far outweighs the cost of negative experiences,\nand we prioritize things that bring us joy. In short, we\u2019re emotionally wiser,\nand that wisdom helps us thrive.\nBut there are still things to learn, still some development ahead, and our\nrelationships are the key to maximizing the joys of late life.\nOne of the harder things for some people to learn is how to give help, and\n\u2014even harder for others as they grow older\u2014how to receive help. But this\nexchange is one of the central developmental tasks in late life. As we age, we\nbecome concerned both that we\u2019re too needy and that people won\u2019t be there\nfor us when we really need them. It\u2019s a valid worry. Social isolation is a\ndanger. As work and child care and other time investments wane,\nrelationships that were normally attached to those activities tend to fall away.\nGood friends and important family connections become more important and\nshould be savored. The sense of limited time makes all of our relationships\nmore important: we have to learn how to balance an awareness of death with\nstaying engaged with life.\nTHE RESOLUTE COUPLE\nWhen Wes Travers was 79, one of our Study interviewers paid Wes and\nAmy a visit. She landed in Phoenix in the middle of the afternoon and called\nWes. He gave her very specific directions on how to get from the airport to\nthe retirement community, and then from the entrance gate up to their duplex.\nThe directions were clear as day, even a bit overly detailed. As she\napproached in her car, she realized they must have known the exact travel\ntime from the airport because they were ready for her: she could see the two\nof them standing in the door way, waving.\nWes had just come in from his morning walk. Amy offered our\ninterviewer coffee, water, and freshly baked blueberry bread.\nBefore they settled in to the research tasks at hand\u2014a  blood draw for\nDNA collection and an interview\u2014the interviewer asked the couple about\ntheir son, Ryan.\nAmy paused, then explained that the family had recently experienced a\nterrible tragedy: Ryan\u2019s wife had been diagnosed with brain cancer the\nprevious year, and died in December. She was only 43. Amy and Wes were\njust doing whatever they could to help, but Ryan and the kids were all\nstruggling.\n\u201cI can\u2019t help but think of my family growing up,\u201d Wes said. \u201cMy dad ran\naway when I was seven. It changed us. Obviously, he was nothing like Leah,\nour son\u2019s wife\u2014my father was a terrible person. But he left and it changed\neverything. I worry about that for the kids, how they\u2019ll cope. It\u2019s hard to be a\nsingle parent. For me it was probably good that my father left, I don\u2019t know.\nBut for these kids\u2026 it\u2019s going to be hard for them.\u201d\nTURNING POINTS: A JOURNEY THROUGH\nTHE UNEXPECTED\nLet\u2019s pause here for a moment to appreciate the unexpected. Lifespan\ndevelopmental theories often emphasize the predictability and logic of life\nstages. Yet Wes\u2019s life illustrates a truth that we encounter over and ove r again\nin the lives of participants in many studies, including the Harvard Study: that\nthe unexpected is perfectly ordinary. Chance encounters and unforeseen\nevents are a big reason why an individual\u2019s life can never be completely\nunderstood by any \u201csystem\u201d of life stages. An individual life is an\nimprovisation in which circumstances and chance help determine the\ntrajectory. While there are common patterns in life, it would be impossible\nfor any person to make it from the beginning to the end of life without an\nunplanned event sending them in a new direction. There is even some\nresearch that suggests that it\u2019s these unexpected turns, and not any plan, that\nmost define a person\u2019s life and can lead to periods of growth. One wrench\nthrown into the machine can be more significant than all the gears of planned\naction combined.\nMany of these shocks emerge directly from our relationships. We carry\nthe people we love around with us; they are part of us, and when we lose\nthem or those relationships go awry, the feeling is so visceral that it\u2019s almost\nas if there is a physical hole where that person used to be. But intense\nchange, even of the traumatic kind, presents oppor tunities for positive\ngrowth. Evelyn, one of our Second Generation participants, had an\nexperience in her midlife that is not unusual for either men or women:\nEvelyn, age 49:\nMy husband and I had started to grow apart, after being together\nfrom our college days to the end of our 30s. One evening he said he had\nsomething to tell me: he was in love with a woman he met on a business\ntrip.\u2026 I literally felt the floor had fallen away.\u2026 The emotional pain I\nfelt for the next year was visceral. It took a huge amount of energy to get\nup every day, go to work, etc.\u2026 Eventually we divorced, he married\nher, I remarried six years after he first told me. I wouldn\u2019t have thought\nthe outcome of this experience would be positive, but it was. My career\nblossomed, and I met a man who I share a much more full and satisfying\nlife with. I know now I can do well on my own and I have much more\ncompassion and empathy for people who experience loss and rejection.\nI wouldn\u2019t have chosen to go through this experience, but I am glad that I\ndid.\nCultural or even global changes can be similar in their sudden shocks to\nthe system. The Covid-19 pandemic that began in 2020 turned many lives\ninside out. Economic collapses and wars can do the same. All of the college\nmen in the Harvard Study had plans as the 1940s  began, while they were\ncontemplating the end of their college careers. Then Pearl Harbor happened,\nand every plan, for every student, went out the window\u201489 percent of the\ncollege men fought in the war, and their lives were deeply affected by it. Yet\nnearly all of the college men reported feeling proud to have served, and many\nremember it as one of the best and most meaningful times in their lives\ndespite its challenges.\nThis echoes findings from the longitudinal research project known as the\nDunedin Study, which began with 1,037 babies born in New Zealand in\n1972\u201373, and continues today. For a number of the Dunedin participants who\nstruggled in adolescence, military service was seen as an important, positive\nturning point in their life.\nFor some generations it was war, for another generation it was the\nupheaval of the 1960s , or the economic collapse of 2008, or the Covid-19\npandemic. For individuals it might be a tragic accident, a mental health\nproblem, a sudden disease, the death of a loved one. For Wes, it was being\nabandoned by his father, being forced to drop out of school to go to work,\nand many other things. The only thing we can expect is that the unexpected\u2014\nand how we respond to it\u2014will change the course of our lives. In the words\nof a Yiddish proverb, Der mentsh trakht, un Got lakht. Man plans, and God\nlaughs.\nAnd yet, unexpected events are not always challenging. Some are\npositive twists of fate, and these almost always involve relationships. The\npeople we meet in life are responsible for a huge amount of how our life\nmoves. Life is chaotic, and cultivating good relationships increases the\npositivity of that chaos and makes the chances of beneficial encounters more\nlikely (more on this in Chapter Ten). Maybe that earlier photo of yourself\nshows some evidence of positive chance encounters. Nearly every moment of\nour life does: If I hadn\u2019 t taken that class then I would have never met\u2026 If I\nhadn\u2019 t missed the bus that day I wouldn\u2019t have run into\u2026\nIt\u2019s true that we can never be in total control of our fate. Just because\nwe\u2019re having some good luck doesn\u2019t mean we earned it, and just because\nwe\u2019re having some bad luck doesn\u2019t mean we deserve it. We can\u2019t outrun the\nchaos of life. But the more we nurture positive relationships, the better our\nchances of surviving and even thriving on this bumpy ride.\nWES DRINKS SOME COFFEE AND LOOKS\nBACK\nIn 2012,  just two years after our researcher\u2019s visit, at the age of 81, Wes\nsat down at his kitchen table with a cup of coffee to answer our biennial\nquestionnaire (there are some faint coffee stains still visible on the pages).\nHere are a few of his responses:\nQ#8: Who can you really count on to be dependable when you need help? Please list all the\npeople you know whom you can count on in the manner described.\nA: Too many to list.\nQ#9: What is your relationship like with each of your children, on a scale from 1 (Negative\u2014\nhostile and/or distant) to 7 (Positive\u2014Loving and/or close)\nA: 7\nQ#10: Circle the one dot on the scale that best describes how often you feel lonely:\n Never \u2003\u2003S ome of the time\u2003\u2003A  lot of the time\u2003\u2003A ll of the time\nQ#11:\na. How often do you feel that you lack companionship?\n Hardly Ever \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003S ome of the time\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\nb. How often do you feel left out?\n Hardly Ever \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003S ome of the time\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\nc. How often do you feel isolated from others?\n Hardly Ever \u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003S ome of the time\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\nIn this questionnaire, he was asked, What is the most enjoyable activity\nthat you and your wife engage  in together? Wes Travers\u2014who served his\ncountry bravely in war, who traveled all over the world, who built his own\nhomes with no formal training, who raised a happy and healthy stepson, and\nvolunteered every day in his community\u2014wrote that the thing he and his wife\nenjoyed most was: \u201cJust being together.\u201d\nKEEPING PERSPECTIVE ON THE LIFE CYCLE\nIN YOUR BACK POCKET\nSo why bother to think about ourselves in this big-picture way? Can\nthinking about the process of an entire life really help us from one day to the\nnext?\nIt can. Sometimes it\u2019s difficult to understand and connect with the people\nin our lives when all we\u2019re thinking about is what\u2019s right in front of us.\nStepping back now and then to take a wider view, to place ourselves and the\npeople we care about into the context of a longer life, is a great way to inject\nempathy and understanding into our relationships. Some of the frustrations\nwe have with each other can be avoided, and deeper connections made, by\nremembering that our views of life depend on where we stand in the life\ncycle.\nIn the end it\u2019s about gaining some perspective on the roads we\u2019ve taken,\nand the roads still to come, so that we can help each other anticipate and\nprepare for the hard curves ahead. And as the old Turkish proverb says, No\nroad i s long w ith good c ompany .\n  4  \nSOCIAL FITNESS\nKeeping Your Relationships in Good Shape\nA sad soul can kill you quicker, far quicker, than a germ.\nJohn Steinbeck, Travels with Charley\nHarvard Study Second Generation Interview, 2016\nQ: Your father participated in the Harvard Study. Looking back on his life, is there anything you learned from him?\nA: Dad worked very hard and he was a great engineer but he had a hard time expressing his feelings or even knowing his feelings, so he worked\nbecause he didn\u2019t know what to do. He played tennis and had friends, but his marriage fell apart, and he tried it with another woman at 66 and it didn\u2019t\nwork out. He was 80 and when he died he was alone. And I feel bad for him. I imagine that was true for others of his generation.\nVera Eddings, Second Generation participant, age 55\nPsychology often studies the effects of emotional wounds. But we want to talk about one\nparticular study that began by creating wounds. Physical ones.\nIt\u2019s not as bad as it sounds; participants had a piece of their skin the size of a pencil eraser\nremoved from their arms just above the elbow, in a procedure known as a punch biopsy. This is a\ncommon medical procedure normally used to remove and examine a small piece of skin, but this\nstudy was interested not in what was removed but in what was left behind\u2014the wound.\nThe lead researcher, Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, was investigating psychological stress. She\nalready knew from past research that stress affected the immune system. What she wanted to find\nout was whether that stress affected other body  processes, such as how physical wounds heal.\nShe sampled two groups of women. The first were the primary caregivers for loved ones with\ndementia. The second was a group, roughly the same age (early 60s), who were not caregivers.\nThe study itself was very simple. She performed a punch biopsy on all of the participants, and\nthen watched the wounds heal.\nThe results were startling. The wounds of the noncaregivers took about forty days to fully heal,\nbut the wounds of the caregivers took nine days longer to heal. The psychological stress of caring\nfor a loved one, which emerged from the slow erasure of important relationships in their lives,\nwas preventing their bodi es from healing.\nMany years later, Kiecolt-Glaser found herself in the same situation, when her husband and\nclosest research collaborator, Ronald Glaser, developed fast-progressing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nWhen her internist asked her how she was feeling during a regular check-up, Kiecolt-Glaser said\nshe was feeling stressed, and talked about her husband. The internist told her to take care of herself\nand mentioned that there was now research about stress and health in caregivers\u2014research that\nKiecolt-Glaser herself had pioneered. The science had succeeded in making its way into medicine,\nand back to the source.\nTHE MIND IS THE BODY IS THE MIND\nThere is no longer any doubt that the mind and the body  are intertwined. W hen a new emotional\nor physical stimulus is encountered, the entire mind-body  system is affected\u2014s ometimes in\nminuscule ways, sometimes in massive ways\u2014and the changes can have a cyclical effect, with the\nmind affecting the body , which then affects the mind, and so on.\nModern society, though more medically advanced than ever before, encourages some habits\nand routines that are not healthy for body  or mind. Let\u2019s take just one: lack of exercise.\nFifty thousand years ago a Homo sapiens living in a river settlement with her tribe would have\ngotten the physical exercise she needed simply through the effort of staying alive. Now vast\nnumbers of people are able to provide food, shelter, and safety for themselves with little or no\nphysical exercise. Never before has so much human life taken place in a seated position, and a\ngreat deal of the physical work we do is repetitive and potentially damaging. Our bodies do not\ntake care of themselves in this environment\u2014they need maintenance. If those of us in sedentary or\nrepetitive jobs want to maintain our physical fitness, we have to make a conscious effort to move.\nWe have to set time aside to walk, garden, do yoga, run, or go to the gym. We have to overcome the\ncurrents of modern life.\nThe same is true for social fitness.\nIt\u2019s not easy to take care of our relationships today, and in fact, we tend to think that once we\nestablish friendships and intimate relationships, they will take care of themselves. But like\nmuscles, neglected relationships atrophy. Our social life is a living system. And it needs exercise.\nYou don\u2019t have to examine scientific findings to recognize that relationships affect you\nphysically. All you have to do is notice the invigoration you feel when you believe someone has\nreally understood you during a good conversation, or notice the tension and distress after an\nargument, or the lack of sleep during a period of  romantic strife.\nKnowing how to improve our social fitness, however, isn\u2019t easy. Unlike stepping on the scale,\ntaking a quick look in the mirror, or getting readouts for blood pressure and cholesterol, assessing\nour social fitness requires a bit more sustained self-reflection. A much deeper look in the mirror. It\nrequires stepping back from the crush of modern life, taking stock of our relationships, and being\nhonest with ourselves about where we\u2019re devoting our time and whether we are tending to the\nconnections that help us thrive. It can be hard to find the time for this type of reflection, and\nsometimes it\u2019s uncomfortable. But it can yield enormous benefit.\nMany of our Harvard Study participants have told us that filling out questionnaires every two\nyears and being interviewed regularly has given them a welcome perspective on their lives and\nrelationships. We ask them to really think about themselves and the people they love, and that\nprocess helps some of them. But as we\u2019ve mentioned, this benefit to them is incidental\u2014a side\neffect. They have volunteered for research, and our primary focus is learning about their lives. As\nwe move through this chapter, we\u2019ll help you develop your own mini\u2013Harvard Study. We\u2019ve\nboiled down many of the most useful questions we\u2019ve asked Study participants into tools that you\ncan use to develop a picture of your social fitness. Unlike the actual Harvard Study, these are not\ndesigned to gather information for research. Here, the entire point is to give you the benefit of self-\nreflection that our Study members received throughout their lives. We began that process in\nChapter Three, and this is a chance to go a little bit further.\nLooking in the mirror and thinking honestly about where your life stands is a first step in trying\nto live a good life. Noticing where you are can help put into relief where you would like to be. It\u2019s\nunderstandable if you have some reservations about this kind of self-reflection. Our Study\nparticipants were not always keen on filling out our questionnaires, or eager to consider the larger\npicture of their lives. (Recall Henry\u2019s reluctance to answer the question about his biggest fear.)\nSome would skip difficult questions, leave entire pages blank, and some would just not return\ncertain surveys. Some even wrote comments in the margins of their questionnaires about what they\nthought of our requests. \u201cWhat kinds of questions are these!?\u201d is a response we received\noccasionally, often from participants who preferred not to think about difficulties in their lives.\nThe experiences of the people who skipped questions or entire questionnaires were also\nimportant, though, just as crucial in understanding adult development as the experiences of people\neager to share. A lot of useful data and gems of experience were buried in the shadowed corners of\ntheir lives. We just had to go through a little extra effort to dig it all out.\nOne of these people was Sterling Ainsley.\nOUR MAN IN MONTANA\nSterling Ainsley was a hopeful guy. A materials scientist, he retired at 63 and thought of his\nfuture as bright. As soon as he left his job, he started pursuing personal interests, taking real estate\ncourses and studying Italian on tape. He had business ideas as well, and he began reading\nentrepreneurial magazines for ideas that fit his interest. When asked to describe his philosophy for\ngetting through hard times, he said, \u201cYou try not to let life get to you. You remember your victories\nand take a positive attitude.\u201d\nThe year was 1986. Our predecessor, George Vaillant, was on a long interview trek, driving\nthrough the Rocky Mountains, visiting the Study participants who lived in Colorado, Utah, Idaho,\nand Montana. Sterling had not returned the most recent survey, and there was some catching up to\ndo. He met George at a hotel in Butte, Montana, to give him a ride to the diner where Sterling\nwanted to do his scheduled interview (he preferred not to do it in his home). When George\nbuckled himself into the passenger seat of Sterling\u2019s car, the seatbelt left a stripe of dust across his\nchest. \u201cI was left to wonder,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe last time somebody  had used it.\u201d\nSterling had graduated from Harvard in 1944. After college he\u2019d served in the Navy during\nWorld War II and then he\u2019d married, moved to Montana, and had three children. For the next forty\nyears he worked on and off in metals manufacturing for various companies across the American\nWest. Now he was 64 and lived on a 50' x 100' grass lot near Butte in a trailer that he could pull\nbehind a truck. He liked having the grass because mowing it was his main form of exercise. He\nalso tended a garden with an enormous patch of strawberries and what he called \u201cthe biggest peas\nyou ever saw.\u201d He lived in a trailer, he said, because it cost him only $35 a month for hookups,\nand he didn\u2019t feel too committed to the place.\nSterling was still technically married, but his wife lived over ninety miles away in Bozeman,\nand they hadn\u2019t slept in the same room in fifteen years. They spoke only every few months.\nWhen asked why they had not gotten a divorce, he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do that to the\nchildren,\u201d even though his son and two daughters were grown and had children of their own.\nSterling was proud of his kids and beamed when he spoke of them\u2014his oldest daughter owned a\nframing shop, his son was a carpenter, and his youngest daughter was a cellist for an orchestra in\nNaples, Italy. He said his kids were the most important thing in his life, but he seemed to prefer to\nkeep his relationships with them thriving mostly in his imagination. He rarely saw them. George\nnoted that Sterling seemed to be using optimism to push away some of his fears and avoid\nchallenges in his life. Putting a positive spin on every matter and then pushing it out of his mind\nmade it possible for him to believe that nothing was wrong, that he was fine, he was happy, his\nkids didn\u2019t need him.\nThe previous year his youngest daughter had invited him to visit her in Italy. He decided not to\ngo. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a burden,\u201d he said, although he had been learning Italian specifically for\nthat purpose.\nHis son lived only a few hours away, but they hadn\u2019t seen each other in more than a year. \u201cI\ndon\u2019t go dow n there,\u201d he said. \u201cI telephone him.\u201d\nWhen asked about his grandchildren he said, \u201cI\u2019ve not gotten too involved with them.\u201d They\nwere doing great without him.\nWho was his oldest friend?\n\u201cGosh, so many of them died,\u201d he said. \u201cSo many of them die. I hate to get attached. It hurts too\nmuch.\u201d He said he had an old pal from out east but hadn\u2019t talked to him in years.\nAny work friends?\n\u201cMy friends at work retired. We were good buddies, but they moved away.\u201d He talked about\nhis involvement in the VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars) and the fact he moved up to district\ncommander at one point, but he stepped dow n in 1968. \u201c It takes a lot out of you.\u201d\nWhen did he last talk to his older sister, and how was she doing?\nSterling seemed startled by this question. \u201cMy sister?\u201d he said. \u201cYou mean Rosalie?\u201d\nYes, the sister he told the Study so much about when he was younger.\nSterling thought about it for a long time, and then told George that it must have been twenty\nyears ago that he last spoke to her. A frightened expression came over his face. \u201cWould she still be\nliving?\u201d he said.\nSterling tried not to think about his relationships, and he was even less inclined to talk about\nthem. This is a common experience. We don\u2019t always know why we do things or why we don\u2019t do\nthings, and we may not understand what is holding us at a distance from the people in our lives.\nTaking some time to look in the mirror can help. Sometimes there are needs inside of us that are\nlooking for a voice, a way to get out. They might be things that we have never seen, nor articulated\nto ourselves.\nThis seemed to be the case with Sterling. Asked how he spent his evenings, he said he watched\nTV with an 87-year-old woman who lived in a nearby trailer. Each night he would walk over, and\nthey\u2019d watch TV and talk. Eventually she would fall asleep, and he would help her into bed and\nwash her dishes and close the shades before walking home. She was the closest thing he had to a\nconfidant.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if she dies,\u201d he said.\nLONELINESS HURTS\nWhen you\u2019re lonely, it hurts. And we don\u2019t mean that metaphorically. It has a physical effect on\nthe body . Loneliness is associated with being more sensitive to pain, suppression of the immune\nsystem, diminished brain function, and less effective sleep, making an already lonely person even\nmore tired and irritable. Recent research has shown that for older people loneliness is twice as\nunhealthy as obesity, and chronic loneliness increases a person\u2019s odds  of death in any given year\nby 26 percent. A study in the U.K., the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study,\nrecently reported on the connections between loneliness and poorer health and self-care in young\nadults. This ongoing study includes more than 2,200 people born in England and Wales in 1994\nand 1995. When they were 18, the researchers asked them how lonely they were. Those who\nreported being lonelier were more likely to experience mental health problems, to engage in risky\nphysical health behaviors, and to use more negative strategies to cope with stress. Add to this the\nfact that a tide of loneliness is flooding through modern societies, and we have a serious problem.\nRecent stats should make us take notice.\nIn a study conducted online that sampled 55,000 respondents from across the world, one out of\nevery three people of all ages reported that they often feel lonely. Among these, the loneliest group\nwere 16\u201324- year-olds, 40 percent of whom reported feeling lonely \u201coften or very often\u201d (more on\nthis phenomenon soon). In the U.K., the economic cost of this loneliness\u2014be cause lonely people\nare less productive and more prone to employment turnover\u2014is estimated at more than \u00a32.5\nbillion (about $3.4 billion) annually and helped lead to the establishment of a U.K. Ministry of\nLoneliness.\nIn Japan, 32 percent of adults surveyed before 2020 expected to feel lonely most of the time in\nthe coming year.\nIn the United States, a 2018 study suggested that three out of four adults felt moderate to high\nlevels of loneliness. As of this writing, the long-term effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, which\nseparated us from each other on a massive scale and left many feeling more isolated than ever, are\nstill being studied. In 2020 it was estimated that 162,000 deaths could be attributed to causes\nstemming from social isolation.\nAlleviating this epidemic of loneliness is difficult because what makes one person feel lonely\nmight have no effect on someone else. We can\u2019t rely entirely on easily observed indicators like\nwhether or not one lives alone, because loneliness is a subjective experience. One person might\nhave a significant other and too many friends to count and yet feel lonely, while another person\nmight live alone and have a few close contacts, and yet feel very connected. The objective facts of\na person\u2019s life are not enough to explain why someone is lonely. Regardless of your race or class\nor gender, the feeling resides in the difference between the kind of social contact you want and the\nsocial contact you actually have. But, then, how can loneliness be so physically harmful when it\u2019s a\nsubjective experience?\nAnswering that question is a bit easier if we understand the biological roots of the problem. As\nwe discussed in Chapter Two, human beings have evolved to be social. The biological processes\nthat encourage social behavior are there to protect us, not to harm us. When we feel isolated, our\nbodies and brains react in ways that are designed to help us survive that isolation. Fifty thousand\nyears ago, being alone was dangerous. If the Homo sapiens we mentioned earlier was left at her\ntribe\u2019s river settlement by herself, her body  and brain would have gone into temporary survival\nmode. The need to recognize threats would have fallen on her alone, and her stress hormones\nwould have increased and made her more alert. If her family or tribe were away overnight and she\nhad to sleep by herself, her sleep would have been shallower; if a predator was approaching, she\nwould want to know, so she would have been more easily aroused, and she would have\nexperienced more awakenings in the night.\nIf for some reason she found herself alone for say, a month, rather than a night, these physical\nprocesses would continue, morphing into a droning, constant sense of unease, and they would\nbegin to take a toll on her mental and physical health. She would be, as we say, stressed out. She\nwould be lonely.\nThe same effects of loneliness continue today. The feeling of loneliness is a kind of alarm\nringing inside the body . At first, its signals may help us. We need them to alert us to a problem. But\nimagine living in your house with a fire alarm going off all day, every day, and you start to get a\nsense of what chronic loneliness is doing behind the scenes to our minds and bodi es.\nLoneliness is only one piece of the mind-body  equation of relationships. It is the visible tip of\nthe social iceberg; much more is submerged beneath the surface. There is now a vast body  of\nresearch revealing the associations between health and social connection, associations that trace\nback to the origins of the species, when things were much simpler. Our basic relationship needs\nare not complicated. We need love, connection, and a feeling of belonging. But we now live in\ncomplicated social environments, so how we meet those needs is the challenge.\nLIFE BY THE NUMBERS\nThink for a moment about a relationship you have with a person you cherish but feel like you\ndon\u2019t see nearly enough. This needn\u2019t be your most significant relationship, just someone who\nmakes you feel energized when you\u2019re with them, and who you\u2019d like to see more often. Run\nthrough the possible candidates (there may only be one!) and get this person in mind. Now think\nabout the last time you were together and try to re-create in your imagination how they made you\nfeel at the time. Were you optimistic, feeling almost invincible? Did you feel understood?  Maybe\nyou were quick to laugh, and the ills in your life and the world felt less daunting.\nNow think about how often you see that person. Every day? Once a month? Once a year? Do\nthe math and project how many hours in a single year you think you spend with this person. Write\nthis number dow n and hang on to it.\nFor us, Bob and Marc, though we meet up every week by phone or video call, we see each\nother in person only for a total of about two days (forty-eight hours) every year.\nHow does this add up for the coming years? When this book  comes out, Bob will be 71 years\nold. Marc will be 60. Let\u2019s be (very) generous and say we are both around to celebrate Bob\u2019s\n100th birthday. At two days per year for twenty-nine years, that\u2019s fifty-eight days that we have left\nto spend together in our lifetimes.\nFifty-eight out of 10,585 da ys.\nOf course, this is assuming a lot of good fortune, and the real number is almost certainly going\nto be lower.\nTry this calculation with your own cherished relationship, or just consider these round\nnumbers: If you\u2019re 40, and you see this person once a week for a coffee hour, that\u2019s about eighty-\nseven days before you turn 80. If you see them once a month, it\u2019s about twenty days. Once a year,\nabout two days.\nMaybe these numbers sound like plenty. But contrast them with the fact that in 2018, the\naverage American spent an astonishing eleven hours every day interacting with media, from\ntelevision to radio to smartphones. From the age of 40 to the age of 80, that adds up to eighteen\nyears of waking life. For someone who is 18, t hat\u2019s twenty-eight years of life before they turn 80.\nThe point of this mental exercise is not to alarm you. It\u2019s to bring clarity to something that goes\nlargely unnoticed: how much time we actually spend with the people we like and love. We don\u2019t\nneed to be with all of our good friends all the time. In fact, some people who energize us and\nenhance our lives might do so specifically because we don\u2019t see them very often, and like anything\nelse in life, there is a balance that should be struck. Sometimes we are compatible with a person\nonly to a point, and that point is good e nough.\nBut most of us have friends and relatives who energize us and who we don\u2019t see enough. Are\nyou spending time with the people you most care about? Is there a relationship in your life that\nwould benefit both of you if you could spend more time together? These untapped resources are\noften already in our life, waiting. A few adjustments to our most treasured relationships can have\nreal effects on how we feel, and on how we feel about our lives. We might be sitting on a goldmine\nof vitality that we are not paying attention to\u2014be cause this source of vitality is eclipsed by the\nshiny allure of smartphones and TV or pushed to the side by work demands.\nTWO CRUCIAL PREDICTORS OF HAPPINESS\nIn 2008 we telephoned the wives and husbands of Harvard Study couples in their 80s every\nnight for eight nights. We spoke to each partner separately and asked them a series of questions\nabout their days. We mentioned these surveys in Chapter One (they generated a lot of useful data!).\nWe wanted to know how they\u2019d felt physically that day, what kinds of activities they\u2019d been\ninvolved in, if they\u2019d needed or received emotional support, and how much time they\u2019d spent with\ntheir spouse and with other people.\nThe simple measure of time spent with others proved quite important, because on a day-to-day\nbasis this measurement was clearly linked with happiness. On days when these men and women\nspent more time in the company of others, they were happier. In particular, the more time they spent\nwith their partners, the more happiness they reported. This was true across all couples but\nespecially true for those in satisfying relationships.\nLike most older folks, these men and women experienced day-to-day fluctuations in their\nlevels of physical pain and health difficulties. Not surprisingly, their moods  were lower on the\ndays when they had more physical pain. But we found that the people who were in more satisfied\nrelationships were buffered somewhat from these ups and dow ns of mood\u2014t heir happiness did not\ndecline as much on the days when they had more pain. When they felt worse physically, they did\nnot report declines in mood as much as individuals who were in less satisfying relationships.\nTheir happy marriages protected their moods  even on the days when they had more pain.\nThis might all sound quite intuitive, but there is a very powerful yet simple message nestled in\nthese findings: the frequency and the quality of our contact with other people are two major\npredictors of happi ness.\nYOUR SOCIAL OBSERVATORY\nSterling Ainsley, so eager to avoid thinking about any of his relationships, believed he was\ndoing pretty well at social fitness. He thought the way he conducted himself with his kids was\nhealthy, he thought his refusal to divorce his wife whom he rarely saw was somewhat heroic, and\nhe even prided himself on his ability to talk with people\u2014a skill he\u2019d developed in his work life.\nBut when asked to look more deeply in the mirror and consider his relationships, it became clear\nthat deep dow n he felt quite alone, and he had little understanding of how isolated he was.\nSo where do we start? How can we come closer to seeing the reality of our own social\nuniverse?\nIt\u2019s good t o start simple. First, ask: Who is in my life?\nIt\u2019s a question that most of us, amazingly, never bother to ask ourselves. Even making a basic\nlist of the ten people who popu late the center of your social universe can be illuminating. Try it\nbelow; you might be surprised at who comes to mind and who doe sn\u2019t.\nWHO ARE MY CLOSEST FRIENDS AND RELATIVES?\n________________________\u2003________________________\n________________________\u2003________________________\n________________________\u2003________________________\n________________________\u2003________________________\n________________________\u2003________________________\n________________________\u2003________________________\nA few essential relationships\u2014your family, romantic partner, close friends\u2014probably come to\nmind quickly, but don\u2019t think only of your most \u201cimportant\u201d or successful connections. List those\nwho affect you from day to day and year to year\u2014good or bad. Your boss or a particular\ncoworker, for example. Even relationships that seem insignificant could make the list. We\u2019ll talk\nmuch more about this in a later chapter, but acquaintances and casual relationships built around\nactivities like knitting, playing soccer, or meeting with a book  club could be more important to you\nthan you think. The list might also include people you really enjoy but almost never see: for\nexample, an old friend you often find yourself thinking about but with whom you\u2019ve fallen out of\ntouch. It might even include people you only exchange pleasantries with, like the driver of the bus\nyou take to work, whom you look forward to seeing and who gives your day a little jolt of good\nenergy.\nOnce you\u2019ve got a good set of people, it\u2019s time to ask: What is the character of these\nrelationships?\nWe\u2019ve asked Harvard Study participants a huge variety of questions over the years to try to\nanswer this larger question and create \u201cpictures\u201d (really, datasets) that reflect the character of their\nsocial universes. But trying to get some perspective on your own social universe needn\u2019t be as\ncomplex as research. You can simply think about the quality and the frequency of contact you have\nwith each person and use two broad dimensions to capture your social world: 1) How a\nrelationship makes you feel, and 2) How often that happens.\nBelow you will find a chart that you can use to give your social universe a shape on this two-\ndimensional spectrum. Where you locate someone on this chart should depend on how energized or\ndepleting that relationship feels, and how frequently you interact with that person. It looks like this:\nEXAMPLE OF A SOCIAL UNIVERSE\nThis might seem simplistic at first,\u2026 and in a way, it is. You\u2019re taking something intensely\npersonal and complicated, flattening it, and giving it a static place in this social universe;\ncomplexities will be shed in the process. That\u2019s okay. This is a first step at capturing the character\nof the relationships that make your life what it is.\nWhat do w e mean by energizing and depleting?\nThese are subjective terms, and that\u2019s intentional; this is about recognizing how you feel when\nyou are with these individuals. Sometimes we don\u2019t really know how we feel about a relationship\nuntil we stop to think about it.\nIn general, an energizing relationship enlivens and invigorates you, and it gives you a sense of\nconnection and belonging that remains after the two of you part ways. It makes you feel better than\nyou would feel if you were alone.\nA depleting relationship induces tension, frustration, or anxiety, and makes you feel worried,\nor even demoralized. In some ways, it makes you feel lesser or more disconnected than you would\nfeel if you were alone.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that an energizing relationship will make you feel good all the time or that a\ndepleting relationship will make you feel bad all the time. Even our most vital relationships have\ntheir challenges, and many, of course, are a mixed bag. Your general intuition about each person on\nyour list is the thing you want to capture: When you spend time with this person, how do y ou feel?\nTake a look at the chart and think about where each of the people on your list might land. Do\nthey energize or deplete you? Do you see them a lot, or only a little?\nThat cherished person you don\u2019t see enough of can act as your starting point. Set them on the\nmap with a small dot\u2014like a star in your social universe.\nMY SOCIAL UNIVERSE\nAs you set your relationships in their place, think about each one. Why is this person in this\nparticular place? What is it about the relationship that compelled you to put them there? Is this\nrelationship where you want it to be? If a relationship is particularly difficult and has been giving\nyou a depleted feeling, do a ny reasons for this come to mind?\nChecking in with each relationship like this can help us appreciate and be thankful for people\nwho enrich our lives, and it can help us see which relationships we want to work on improving.\nYour answers to these questions will (and should) reflect your own preferences about the amount\nand kind of social connections that suit you. You might realize that you\u2019d like to see this person\nmore often, but that person is in just the right spot. Maybe this other relationship is depleting but\nimportant and needs some special attention. If you have a sense of which direction you\u2019d like a\nrelationship to move, draw an arrow from where they are to the spot you\u2019d like them to be.\nWe want to make clear that identifying a relationship as depleting does not mean you should\ncut that person out of your life (although after some reflection you may decide you need to see\ncertain people less often). Instead, it may be a sign that there is something important there that\nneeds your attention. And that means the relationship contains an oppor tunity.\nIn truth, almost all relationships contain oppor tunities; we just have to identify them. Examples\ninclude important relationships from our past, positive relationships we have been neglecting, and\ndifficult relationships that may contain the seeds of a better connection. But these oppor tunities\ndon\u2019t last forever; we have to take advantage of them while we can. If we wait too long, we might\nfind, as Sterling Ainsley did, that it\u2019s too late.\nROSALIE, HARRIET, AND STERLING\nSterling Ainsley was one of the Harvard College men in the Study, but he was not born into\nprivilege. In fact, he was born directly into his older sister\u2019s arms. This was near Pittsburgh,\nPennsylvania, in 1923, and Rosalie, his sister, was 12 years old. She\u2019d been home alone with their\nmother, who was giving Rosalie a French lesson at the kitchen table when she suddenly went into\nlabor. They did not have a telephone and there was no time to fetch the neighbors or a doctor.\nThrough waves of screaming pain their mother managed to give Rosalie instructions about what to\ndo every step of the way, and Rosalie was able to help deliver Sterling safely. She even tied and\ncut the umbilical cord. \u201cI was extremely close to Sterling,\u201d Rosalie told the Study. \u201cAs far as I was\nconcerned, I was responsible for him. I treated him like my own child.\u201d\nSterling\u2019s father was a steelworker and made just enough to support their family of seven, but\nhe was also a compulsive gambler. Every week he would risk his wages, only a fraction of which\nmade it home, so the older kids were forced to work. Three weeks after Sterling was born, his\nfather committed his mother to a sanitarium. For four months, Rosalie took care of Sterling, feeding\nhim from a bottle. \u201cI remember walking the floor with him, singing songs,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen my\nmother came home, she was different. My father was illiterate, but my mother had been a brilliant\nwoman and spoke three languages with us and taught us how to read and write both English and\nFrench, but after that she was never the same. She couldn\u2019t take care of Sterling. She didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do, e ven though she\u2019d already raised four kids. So I looked after him for several years.\u201d\nWhen Sterling was nine years old, his father again committed his mother to a sanitarium, this\ntime permanently, and then abruptly moved away, leaving the younger children to fend for\nthemselves. By this time, Rosalie, at 21 years old, was married and had a child of her own, and\nshe and her husband took three of her siblings into their home. She wanted to bring Sterling also,\nbut a family friend, Harriet Ainsley, had recently lost her own son to a tragic accident and offered\nto take Sterling and raise him as her own. Already strained financially, Rosalie and her husband\nagreed.\nThe Ainsleys lived on a farm in rural Pennsylvania and the lifestyle was a shock for Sterling,\nbut his adoptive parents were kind, calm, and supportive. His adoptive father was stern but fair,\nand taught Sterling everything he could about how to run and operate the farm. When Sterling was\n19 he said of Harriet, his adoptive mother, \u201cShe means about everything in the world to me. She\nhas been a wonderful mother. I think she has been responsible for my aspiring to anything. She is\nthe one who gave me a great interest in English literature.\u201d\nThanks in part to encouragement from his adoptive mother and his sister Rosalie, Sterling did\nwell in high school, ran (and lost) a campaign for school president, and was accepted to Harvard\nwith a scholarship. When Sterling entered the Study at age 19, Rosalie was asked what she thought\nof him, and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe him today. He has a tendency, I think, to bring out the\nbest in people that he comes in contact with. He has high ideals. When I spend a day with Sterling,\nI feel as though I have been to some higher institution of learning.\u201d\nThese two brave and resilient women, Rosalie and Harriet, played pivotal roles in Sterling\u2019s\nlife. His biological mother, who was not a part of his life, nonetheless played a vital role through\nher cultivation of the kindness, caring, and determination in Rosalie that then allowed Rosalie to\nraise Sterling by herself in those early years. Still, their father was abusive to Sterling, something\nRosalie could not control, and the eventual breakup of the family was extremely difficult for\nSterling. If it wasn\u2019t for each of the women who loved him in turn, it is highly unlikely Sterling\nwould have gone to college and made a life for himself out west. As working-class women in the\nearly half of the twentieth century, there was much preventing them from pursuing their own\npersonal priorities. But they did their best to help Sterling. He said many times in his interviews\nhow grateful he was for their support and for their love.\nAnd yet he lost touch with both of them.\nTHE KEYSTONES OF RELATIONSHIPS\nWe\u2019ve been saying that human beings are social creatures; in essence this simply means that\neach of us as individuals cannot provide everything we need for ourselves. We can\u2019t confide in\nourselves, romance ourselves, mentor ourselves, or help ourselves move a sofa. We need others to\ninteract with and to help us, and we flourish when we provide that same connection and support to\nothers. This process of giving and receiving is the foundat ion of a meaningful life. How we feel\nabout our social universe is directly related to the kinds of things we are receiving from and giving\nto other people. When Study participants expressed a sense of frustration or dissatisfaction with\ntheir social lives, as Sterling did in his later life, it could often be traced to a particular kind of\nsupport that was missing.\nHere are the sorts of questions about various types of support that the Study has asked\nparticipants about over the years:\nSafety and Security\nWho would you call if you woke up scared in the middle of the night?\nWho would you turn to in a moment of crisis?\nRelationships that give us a sense of safety and security are the fundamental building blocks of\nour relational lives. If you can list specific people in response to the above  questions, you are very\nfortunate\u2014those relationships are crucial to cultivate and appreciate. They help us navigate\nthrough times of stress and give us the courage to explore new experiences. What\u2019s essential is the\nconviction that these relationships will be there for us if things go wrong.\nLearning and Growth\nWho encourages you to try new things, to take chances, to pursue your life\u2019s goals?\nFeeling secure enough to venture out into unknown territory is one thing, but being encouraged\nor inspired to do s o by someone we trust is a precious gift.\nEmotional Closeness and Confiding\nWho knows everything (or most things) about you?\nWho can you call on when you\u2019re feeling low and be honest with them about how you\u2019re feeling?\nWho can you ask for advice (and trust what they say)?\nIdentity Affirmation and Shared Experience\nIs there someone in your life who has shared many experiences with you and who helps strengthen your sense of who you\nare and where you\u2019ve come from?\nFriends from childhood, siblings, people you shared major life experiences with\u2014these\nrelationships are often neglected because they have been with us for so long, but they are\nespecially valuable because they cannot be replaced. As the song goes, You can\u2019t make old\nfriends.\nRomantic Intimacy (Love and Sex)\nDo you feel satisfied with the amount of romantic intimacy in your life?\nAre you satisfied in your sexual relationships?\nRomance is something most of us hope for, not only for sexual satisfaction, but also for the\nintimacy of another\u2019s touch, the sharing of day-to-day joys and sorrows, and the meaning that\ncomes with witnessing each other\u2019s experiences. For some of us, romantic love feels like an\nessential part of life. For others, not so much. Marriage, of course, is not necessarily the\nbenchmark of romantic intimacy. The proportion of people ages 25 to 50 who never marry has\nincreased dramatically in the last half century in many places around the world. In the U.S., this\nproportion increased, from 9 percent in 1970 to 35 percent in 2018. These figures do not tell us the\npercentage who experience romantic intimacy, but they are an indicator that in the U.S. more\npeople remain unmarried in their adult lives than perhaps ever before. In addition, some committed\npartnerships are \u201copen,\u201d including people outside the couple in both sexual and emotional\nintimacy.\nHelp\u2014Both Informational and Practical\nWho do you turn to if you need some expertise or help solving a practical problem (e.g., you need to plant a tree, fix your\nWiFi connection, apply for health insurance)?\nFun and Relaxation\nWho makes you laugh?\nWho do you call to see a movie or go on a road trip?\nWho makes you feel relaxed, connected, at ease?\nBelow you\u2019ll find a table arranged around these keystones of support. The first column is for\nthe relationships you think have the greatest impact on you. Place a plus (+) symbol in the\nappropriate columns if a relationship seems to add to that type of support in your life, and a minus\n(-) symbol if a relationship lacks that type of support. Remember: it\u2019s okay if not all (or even most)\nrelationships offer you all of these types of support.\n \n \nSOURCES OF SUPPORT IN MY LIFE\nMy\nRelationship\nWithSafety\nand\nSecurityLearning\nand\nGrowthEmotional\nCloseness\nand\nConfidingIdentity\nAffirmation\nand Shared\nExperienceRomantic\nIntimacyHelp\n(Both\nInfo and\nPractical)Fun and\nRelaxation\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \nThink of this exercise like an X-ray\u2014a tool that helps you see below the surface of your social\nuniverse. Not all of these types of support will feel important to you, but consider which of them\ndo feel important, and ask yourself if you\u2019re getting enough support in those areas. If you\u2019re feeling\na certain dissatisfaction in your life, do any of the gaps on the chart resonate with that feeling?\nMaybe you realize you have plenty of people you have fun with, but nobody  you can turn to when\nyou need someone to confide in. Or vice versa.\nAs you fill in and expand this table, you might see some gaps, and also some surprises. You\nmight not have realized that you only have one person you go to for help, or that a person you take\nfor granted actually makes you feel safe and secure, or that another person reinforces your sense of\nidentity in important ways. We know from personal experience (and many conversations over\ndrinks at conferences) that even professionals in the fields of psychology and psychiatry have a\nhard time seeing their own lives in this way without focused reflection.\nMOVING FORWARD\nSometimes this kind of reflection alone will point us in the direction we\u2019d like to go, but even\nafter we see what we\u2019d like to change we may still have trouble taking the first steps.\nThere is an entire field of research that studies human motivation\u2014why we make the decisions\nwe make, why some people make efforts to change while others never manage it. This research is\npopu lar among advertisers, who use it to encourage us to buy stuff. But we can also use it to\nencourage ourselves to do things we want\u2014like take steps toward growth in our relationships. In\nfact, we\u2019ve already applied some of it in this chapter: one of the things this research shows is that\na key to motivating change is recognizing the difference between where we are and where we\nwould like to be. Defining these two states creates a kind of potential energy that helps us to take\nthat first difficult step. This is what you have started to do with these relational tools. You\u2019ve\nmapped your social universe and the quality of your relationships, and you\u2019ve reflected on what\nyou might like to change. From here, the process of actually doing it can be messy\u2014pa rticularly\nfor challenging relationships\u2014bu t the potential rewards are great. We\u2019ll get into that process more\nin coming chapters, but there are a few things you can do immediately, and some useful principles\nto keep in mind.\nWORKING FROM THE TOP DOWN\nFocus first on what\u2019s working well. This is the easiest place to begin. Take a look at the\nrelationships on the energizing side of your social universe and consider how you might solidify or\nencourage what\u2019s great about them. Tell (and show!) those people how much you appreciate them,\nand why. It never hurts to double down on what\u2019s already bringing energy and vitality into your\nlife. These relationships are already rolling, but there are usually one or two that have slowed\ndown and need a little push to get up and running at full tilt again. Even good relationships tend to\nrepeat the same routines over and ove r. It might be time to try some new things with them.\nNext, take a look at those relationships that are just peeking over that energizing line, or are\nmaybe a little bit depleting on balance. Is there a way you can give these relationships a nudge, and\nmake them more energizing? Minor changes in these relationships can sometimes relieve small\nburdens that have been adding up.\nThe relationships you\u2019ve identified as depleting might require some more consideration and\nreflection. You might need to take a risk and reach out to someone you might not normally contact,\nmessage them, plan a get-together, or invite them to an event. It might mean addressing some\nemotional elephant in the room like a recent argument or a snarky comment. (That could require\nsome additional preparation, and we\u2019ll talk about navigating disagreements and emotional\nchallenges like this in coming chapters.)\nThere are some nuts and bolts to this kind of effort. You have to actually make that call, take\nout your calendar, clear that evening, and make plans. Preferably recurring plans!\nBut even with your most positive relationships, some of the old habits, the old automatic ways\nof being and interacting that make the relationship less energizing, may resurface. What follows are\na few broad principles that we\u2019ve found both in research and therapy to be effective in enlivening\nand energizing relationships:\nSuggestion #1: The Power of Generosity\nIn the Western world, with its emphasis on individualism, the myth of the \u201cself-made\u201d man or\nwoman gets a lot of airtime. Many of us imagine that our identity is self-created, that we are who\nwe are because we made ourselves that way. In reality, we are who we are because of where we\nstand in relation to the world and to other people. The spoke of a wheel, if not attached to a wheel,\nis just a piece of metal. Even a hermit living in a cave is defined by his relation to, and distance\nfrom, other people.\nRelationships are necessarily reciprocal systems. Support goes both ways. The support we\nreceive is rarely an exact mirror image of the support we provide, but the old adage \u201cyou get what\nyou give\u201d is a good g eneral rule.\nThis idea of giving what you\u2019d like to receive in return is one answer to the powerlessness and\nhopelessness that people sometimes feel when they think of their relationships. We can\u2019t directly\ncontrol the way other people engage with us, but we can control the way we engage with them. We\nmay not be receiving a certain kind of support, but that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t give it.\nThe Dalai Lama reminds us that what goes around comes around. \u201cWe are self-centered and\nselfish, but we need to be wisely selfish, not foolishly so,\u201d he once said. \u201cIf we neglect others, we\ntoo lose.\u2026 We can educate people to understand that the best way to fulfill their own interest is to\nbe concerned about the welfare of others. But this will take time.\u201d\nResearch clearly shows that he\u2019s right: helping others benefits the one who helps. There is both\na neural and a practical link between generosity and happiness. Being generous is a way to prime\nyour brain for good feelings, and those good feelings in turn make us more likely to help others in\nthe future. Generosity is an upward spiral.\nGo back through the questions about support from earlier in the chapter and, thinking honestly\nabout yourself, answer them in the oppos ite direction: Do you provide these types of support to\nothers? If so, to whom? Are there people in your life you want to support more? Recall Kiecolt-\nGlaser\u2019s research on caregiver stress and wound healing from earlier in this chapter. If you have\npeople in your life who are caring for others, or who are under major life stress, are there ways\nyou can be there for them, and make sure they are receiving support themselves? If you are a\ncaregiver, are you getting the support you need? As you look over your social universe, how does\nthe balance of giving and receiving feel?\n \n \nPEOPLE I SUPPORT\nMy\nRelationship\nWithSafety\nand\nSecurityLearning\nand\nGrowthEmotional\nCloseness\nand\nConfidingIdentity\nAffirmation\nand Shared\nExperienceRomantic\nIntimacyHelp\n(Both\nInfo and\nPractical)Fun and\nRelaxation\n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \n        \nSuggestion #2: Learning New Dance Steps\nWe get better at what we practice, and without realizing it we can become very talented at\ndoing things that are not in our interest. Sterling Ainsley, for example, had gotten better and better\nat avoiding closeness and connection. He had good reason; even though he had his sister, Rosalie,\nthere with him during the first years of his life, she couldn\u2019t stop his father\u2019s abuse, and his family\nof origin was pulled apart when his father committed his mother to the sanitarium. When Sterling\nmoved to the farm, he could no longer see Rosalie on a regular basis, and this was painful to him.\nSo he carried his fears of close relationships far into his adult life. With the exception of his\nadoptive mother, he never established that crucial sense of safety and security with another person,\nlet alone with multiple people. Without necessarily articulating it to himself, he lived his life\nassuming that he would be happier, or at least safer, without close contacts. Being close to others,\nhe believed, was a risk.\nHe was right, in a way. Our strongest feelings emerge from our connections with other people,\nand while the social world is filled with pleasures and meaning, it also contains doses of\ndisappointment and pain. We get hurt by the people we love. We feel the sting when they\ndisappoint us or leave us, and the emptiness when they die.\nThe impulse to avoid these negative experiences in relationships makes sense. But if we want\nthe benefits of being involved with other people, we have to tolerate a certain amount of risk. We\nalso have to be willing to see beyond our own concerns, and our own fears.\nThis raises that important question of how someone with Sterling\u2019s traumatic history can keep\nfrom letting it dominate their life. We hope he would have good experiences of closeness as he got\nolder that would change his reigning paradigm. It happens. A positive, trusting relationship with a\nspouse can make a less secure person feel more secure. But too many people with Sterling\u2019s\nhistory just move from one self-fulfilling prophecy to another and never have a different\nexperience of closeness.\nThe question is, how do we keep from always fighting the last traumatic battle and open\nourselves to new experience?\nSuggestion #3: Radical Curiosity\nEvery man I meet is my master in some point, and in that I learn of him.\nRalph Waldo Emerson\nWe often struggle in relationships for the same reason we struggle in other areas of life: we\nbecome too self-focused. We worry about whether we\u2019re doing it right, whether we\u2019re good at\nsomething, whether we\u2019re getting what we want. Like Sterling, or John Marsden, the unhappy\nlawyer, when we become too self-focused, we can forget about the experiences of others.\nIt\u2019s a common trap, but it\u2019s not inevitable. The same curiosity that makes us want to experience\nsomething new in a book  or a movie can inform how we approach our relationships in even the\nmost routine moments of life.\nIt can be a real joy to lose ourselves in the experience of another person. It can also feel\nstrange at first, if you\u2019re not used to it, and it might take some effort. Curiosity\u2014real, deep\ncuriosity about  what others are experiencing\u2014 goes a long way in important relationships. It\nopens up avenues of conversation and knowledge that we never knew were there. It helps others\nfeel understood and appreciated. It\u2019s important even in less significant relationships, where it can\nset a precedent of caring and increase the strength of new, fragile bonds.\nMaybe you know someone in your life who is always talking to people, rooting out their\nstories and opinions. It\u2019s no coincidence that these people are often very joyful and alive. Just as\nthe \u201cstrangers on a train\u201d experiment we mentioned in Chapter Two demonstrated, interacting with\nother people improves our mood a nd makes us happier than we expect it will.\nBob thinks of his father, who would talk to strangers everywhere. He was obsessively\u2014\nradically\u2014curious about everyone. Bob\u2019s aunt and uncle often told a story about how they once\ngot into a cab with him in Washington, D.C. Bob\u2019s father sat in the front, as always, so he could\ntalk to the driver. While he was extracting this man\u2019s entire life story, he started playing with the\nquarter-glass window that used to be a feature in old cars. He was so absorbed in the conversation\nthat he didn\u2019t realize the window had come off in his hand. Peals of laughter were coming from the\nbackseat, but Bob\u2019s father was too absorbed in his conversation to notice. He set the little window\non the seat beside him and started playing with the window crank, which also came off. He set that\ndown, too, a nd just kept asking questions. Lucky for the car it was a short drive.\nThis behavior came naturally to him. He didn\u2019t necessarily do it to be kind to people, he did it\nbecause it made him feel good. It energized him. Some of us are out of practice and have forgotten\nhow this kind of curiosity can feel, so we have to be more deliberate. We have to take an almost\nradical approach to cultivating the often subtle seeds of our natural interest in people, and take a\nbold step beyond our usual conversation habits. We need to make a point to ask ourselves: Who is\nthis person, really, and what\u2019s their deal? Then it\u2019s as simple as asking a question, listening to the\nreply, and seeing where it takes us.\nThe crucial point is that being curious helps us connect to others, and this connection makes us\nmore engaged with life. Genuine curiosity invites people to share more of themselves with us, and\nthis in turn helps us understand them. This process enlivens everyone involved. The \u201cstrangers on\na train\u201d experiment points to these cascading benefits, which we\u2019ll discuss much more in Chapter\nTen. Even a small interest in another person, a brief word, can create new excitements, new\navenues of connection, and new pathways for life to flow.\nLike generosity, curiosity is an upward spiral.\nFROM CURIOSITY TO UNDERSTANDING\nWhen people hear that we, Bob and Marc, are therapists, they often react by saying something\nlike, \u201cHow can you listen to other people\u2019s problems all the time? That must be exhausting and\ndepressing.\u201d It\u2019s true that listening isn\u2019t always easy, but the more prevalent and powerful\nexperience for both of us is one of gratitude to the people we work with in therapy. We learn from\ntheir experience and it deepens our connection to them. One of our greatest joys (and this is not\nconfined to therapy) comes in moments when we sense that we\u2019ve understood the experience of\nanother person and then communicated that understanding in a way that feels true to them. It\u2019s life-\naffirming to suddenly find oneself in sync with the experience of someone else.\nThis is a crucial step in connecting with others through curiosity: communicating your new\nunderstanding back to them. This is where a lot of the magic happens, where the connection\nbetween people becomes solid, visible, and meaningful. Hearing an accurate understanding of our\nown experience coming from another person, articulated in their words, can be thrilling, especially\nwhen we\u2019re feeling alienated in a social setting. Suddenly someone is seeing us as we are, and that\nexperience momentarily breaches the barrier that we feel between us and the world. To be seen is\nan amazing thing.\nConversely, it\u2019s an amazing thing to really see another person, and to communicate that new\nsight. The thrill of connection happens both for the person being seen and the person doing the\nseeing. Again, the connection and the feeling of vitality go bot h ways.\nThis is not a new or unconventional idea. The classic and hugely influential Dale Carnegie\nbook  How to Win Friends and Influence People, written in 1936, emphasized this point. The book\nis based on six principles, and the very first is \u201cBecome genuinely interested in other people.\u201d As\nwith anything, the more you practice this kind of curiosity, the easier it gets. And the materials for\npractice are almost always available. You can make a choice right now, today, even in the next few\nminutes, that will move you in the right direction.\nTAKING IT BACK TO LIFE\nJust as maintaining social fitness requires some regular exercise, reflecting on all of your\nrelationships benefits from regular check-ins. Don\u2019t hesitate to do it again in the future. If your\nsocial fitness is not where you would like it to be, you might want to do these reflective check-ins\neven more often. It never hurts\u2014especially if you\u2019ve been feeling low\u2014to take a minute to reflect\non how your relationships are faring and what you wish could be different about them. If you\u2019re the\nscheduling type, you could make it a regular thing; perhaps every year on New Year\u2019s Day or the\nmorning of your birthday, take a few moments to draw up your current social universe, and\nconsider what you\u2019re receiving, what you\u2019re giving, and where you would like to be in another\nyear. You could keep your chart or relationships assessment somewhere private, or even right here\nin this book , so you know where to look the next time you want to peek at it to see how things have\nchanged. A lot can happen in a year.\nIf nothing else, doing this reminds us of what\u2019s most important; always a good thing. Over and\nover again, when the participants in the Harvard Study reached their 70s and 80s, they would make\na point to say that what they valued most were their relationships with friends and family. Sterling\nAinsley himself made that point. He loved his adoptive mother and sister deeply\u2014bu t he lost touch\nwith them. Some of his fondest memories were of his friends\u2014whom he never contacted. There\nwas nothing he cared more about than his children\u2014whom he rarely saw. From the outside it might\nlook like he didn\u2019t care. That was not the case. Sterling was quite emotional in his recounting of\nhis most cherished relationships, and his reluctance to answer certain Study questions was clearly\nconnected to the pain that keeping his distance had caused him over the years. Sterling never sat\ndown to really think about how he might conduct his relationships, or what he might do to properly\ncare for the people he loved most.\nIf we accept the wisdom\u2014and more recently the scientific evidence\u2014that our relationships\nreally are among our most valuable tools for sustaining health and happi ness, then choos ing to\ninvest time and energy in them becomes vitally important. And an investment in our social\nfitness isn\u2019t only an investment in our lives as they are now. It is an investment that will affect\neverything about  how  we live in the future.\n  5  \nATTENTION TO RELATIONSHIPS\nYour Best Investment\nThe only gift is a portion of thyself.\nRalph Waldo Emerson\nHarvard Study Second Generation Questionnaire, 2015\nIt seems I am \u201crunning on automatic\u201d without much awareness of what I\u2019m doing.\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003O ccasionally\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nI rush through activities without being really attentive to them.\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003O ccasionally\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nI pay attention to physical experiences, such as the wind in my hair or the sun on my face.\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003O ccasionally\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nImagine you began your life with all the money you\u2019ll ever have. The\ninstant you were born you were given one account, and anytime you\u2019ve had to\npay for something, it\u2019s come out of that account.\nYou don\u2019t need to work, but everything you do costs money. Food, water,\nhousing, and consumer goods  are as expensive as ever, but now even sending\nan email requires some of your precious funds. Sitting quietly in a chair\ndoing nothing costs money. Sleep costs money. Everything you encounter\nrequires you to spend money.\nBut the problem is this: you don\u2019t know how much money is in the\naccount, and when it runs dry, your life is over.\nIf you found yourself in this circumstance, would you live in the same\nway? Would you do a nything differently?\nThis is a fantasy, but change one key element and it\u2019s not far from our\nactual situation as human beings. Only instead of money, our one account has\na limited amount of time\u2014and we don\u2019t know how much.\nIt is an everyday sort of question\u2014How should we spend our time?\u2014bu t\nbecause of the brevity and uncertainty of life, it is also a profound question,\nand has major implications for our health and happiness.\nThere is a Buddhist mantra that monks are taught to use in meditation. It\ngoes like this: \u201cIf only death is certain, and the time of death is uncertain,\nthen what should I do?\u201d\nWhen you are confronted with an unavoidable awareness of the end of\nyour own life, it imbues the world with a new perspective, and different\nthings become important.\nWhen we conducted our eight-day survey of Harvard Study couples in\ntheir 80s, at the end of each daily interview we asked them a different\nquestion about their perspectives on the life they\u2019d lived so far. The value of\ntime was often central to their answers:\nDAY 7: As you look back on your life, what do you wish you had done less of? Had done\nmore of?\nEdith, age 80: Less getting upset about silly things. When you put them into perspective, they weren\u2019t all that\nimportant. Less worrying about those things. More time with my children, husband, mother, father.\nNeil, age 83: Wish I\u2019d spent more time with my wife. She died just as I\u2019d begun to taper down with work.\nThese are only two of many similar responses. Nearly all Study\nparticipants were concerned about how they\u2019d spent their time, and many felt\nthat they hadn\u2019t given enough thought to what they paid attention to. It\u2019s an\nextremely common feeling. The flow of days has a way of whisking us away,\nso that we feel life is merely happening to us, that we are subjected to it,\ninstead of actively shaping it. Like many people, some of our Study\nparticipants reached the late stages of their lives and looked back and had\nthoughts like, I didn\u2019t see my friends enough\u2026  I didn\u2019t pay enough\nattention to my kids\u2026 So much of my time was spent doing things that\nweren\u2019t important to me.\nNote those verbs that we can\u2019t escape: We \u201cspend\u201d time, we \u201cpay\u201d\nattention.\nLanguage\u2014and perhaps English in particular\u2014is so saturated with\neconomic jargon that these words seem natural, they seem to make sense, but\nour time and attention are much, much more precious than these words\nsuggest. Time and attention are not something we can replenish. They are\nwhat our life is. When we offer our time and attention, we are not merely\nspending and pay ing. W e are giving our  lives.\nAs the philosopher Simone Weil once wrote, \u201cAttention is the rarest and\npurest form of generosity.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because attention\u2014time\u2014is the most valuable thing we possess.\nMany decades after Simone Weil, the Zen master John Tarrant gave her\ninsight a new dimension in his book The Light Inside the Dark. \u201cAttention,\u201d\nhe wrote, \u201cis the most basic form of love.\u201d\nWe are pointing here to a truth that is difficult to put into words; like\nlove, attention is a gift that flows both ways. When we give our attention, we\nare giving life, but we are also feeling more alive in the process.\nTime and attention are the essential materials of happiness. They are the\nreservoir from which our lives flow. This is more accurate than any financial\nmetaphor. Just as the water from a reservoir can be directed to, and enrich,\nparticular areas of a landscape, the flow of our attention can enliven and\nenrich particular areas of our lives. So it never hurts to take a look at where\nour attention has been flowing, and ask if it\u2019s going into places that benefit\nboth the people we love and ourselves (these two things usually go together).\nAre we thriving? Are the activities and pursuits that make us feel most alive\ngetting their due share? Who are the people most important to us, and are\nthose relationships, challenges and all, getting the attention they deserve?\nNO TIME TODAY BUT PLENTY OF TIME\nTOMORROW\nWe are using the word \u201cattention\u201d in two different ways.\nThe first meaning of the word is really that of priority and time spent.\nThis relates to the frequency dimension of the social universe chart from\nChapter Four. Are we prioritizing the things that are most important to us,\nmoving them to the front of the list when we apportion our time?\nThat\u2019s easy to say, you might be thinking, but you obviously haven\u2019t seen\nmy life. I can\u2019t just magically put more hour s into the day. I\u2019m investing my\ntime in work so that my loved ones can eat and my kids have clothes to\nwear to school. I\u2019m already stretched to the maximum, so how can I devote\ntime that I don\u2019 t have?\nIt\u2019s a good qu estion. So let\u2019s talk for a moment about time.\nWe often have two contradictory feelings about the time we have\navailable to us. On one hand we sense a time famine and feel that there\u2019s just\nnot enough time in the day to do everything that we need to do, let alone that\nwe want to do. On the other hand, we tend to think that in some unspecified\nfuture we will have a time surplus, as if we\u2019ll get to a place in our lives\nwhere the kinds of things capturing our time right now will cease to consume\nus. That overdue visit to parents, that call to an old friend\u2014a nything we tend\nto imagine happening later\u2014often gets the same treatment. \u201cThere\u2019ll be\nplenty of time later,\u201d we think, \u201cfor that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that large numbers of people report feeling too busy and\noverwhelmed with responsibilities and obligations. As the twenty-first\ncentury steamrolls ahead, it feels as if we have less and less time available,\nand those of us who feel time-poor are more stressed and less healthy. The\nmost time-poor people in every society must be working longer and longer\nhours, right?\nNot exactly. Globally, average work hours have declined significantly\nsince the middle of the last century. Americans on average are working 10\npercent less than they did in 1950 , and in some countries like the Netherlands\nand Germany, working hours have been reduced by as much as 40 pe rcent.\nThese are averages, and there are some caveats about who is working\nmore, who is working less. For example, working mothers have the least\nleisure time, people with more education tend to work more and have less\nleisure time, and those with less education tend to have the most leisure time.\nSo the picture isn\u2019t simple. But the data are clear: even considering the\ncaveats, people are less busy with work than in recent generations, and yet\nwe still feel that our time is stretched to the max. Why?\nThe answer to this question may lie in the second meaning of the word\n\u201cattention,\u201d which is about how we spend time, and specifically, about what\nour mind is doing at any given moment.\nTHINKING ABOUT WHAT IS NOT HAPPENING\nThe two of us, Bob and Marc, have lived several hundred miles from\neach other for more than two decades. In order to work on projects together\nwe have had to meet up by phone or video call. We\u2019re old friends but we\nhave to set strict appointments, otherwise we\u2019d never make it happen. When\nthe appointment finally comes, at least once a week, we both see it like a\nscheduled respite in a hectic workweek. We relax a little bit and let down\nour guard. And sometimes, after being so focused all day or all week, when\nwe\u2019re finally talking with each other, our attention wanders.\nYou know the feeling. Life is crazy, and there are always a million things\nto do. When you sit down with a friend, or with your kids, and you have a\nmoment, your comfort and confidence in the relationship means you don\u2019t\nreally need to pay full attention. These are the people you know. You have a\nroutine together, the interaction is familiar, and maybe there\u2019s nothing\nparticularly novel going on, so your mind kind of floats away. And even\nwhen our lives aren\u2019t floode d with worries and to-dos, there\u2019s always the\nvast flow of information on the internet calling to us. One moment of\ndowntime in our day, and out comes the phone.\nEven as we were working on this chapter, literally discussing the act of\npaying attention, Marc began to sense a familiar silence on the phone. Bob\nhad spaced out.\n\u201cBob,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost you.\u201d\nIt happens to everybody . In a 2010 study, Matthew Killingsworth and\nDaniel Gilbert turned one of the modern culprits of distraction\u2014the\nsmartphone\u2014against itself, and used it to conduct a massive study of how we\nspend our waking moments, both physically and mentally. First they designed\nan app that contacted participants on their smartphones at random times\nthroughout the day and presented them with questions about what they were\ndoing, thinking, and feeling, recording their answers. The database collected\nmillions of samples from more than five thousand people of all ages in\neighty-three countries and across eighty-six occupational categories. Their\nfindings showed that close to half of our waking moments are spent thinking\nabout something other than what we are doing. Close to half! As the authors\nof the study point out, this is not just an unfortunate mental quirk, but a\ndistinctly human evolutionary adaptation.\nThinking about the past and the future lets us plan, anticipate, and make\ncreative connections among different ideas and experiences. But the modern\nenvironment, with all of its stimulation, may hold our minds in this state of\ndistraction far beyond the point of diminishing returns. Our minds are not\nanticipating and making creative connections so much as wandering in the\nweeds. And the study by Killingsworth and Gilbert clearly showed what we\nare all dimly aware of\u2014that a wandering mind is conne cted to\nunhappi ness.\n\u201cThe ability to think about what is not happening,\u201d they wrote, \u201cis a\ncognitive achievement that comes at an emotional cost.\u201d\nTHE OWL AND THE HUMMINGBIRD\nThis cognitive ability to remember the past and anticipate the future is\none reason some of us feel so busy\u2014not because of the number of tasks we\nhave to complete in the day, but because of the sheer number of things\ncompeting for our attention. What is commonly called \u201cdistraction\u201d is\nprobably better understood a s overstimulation.\nRecent findings in neuroscience have shown that our conscious minds\ncannot do more than one thing at a time. It may feel like you are able to\nmultitask and think about two (or more) things at once, but really your mind\nis switching between them. This is a costly process neurologically speaking.\nSwitching from one task to another takes energy and a measurable amount of\ntime. Then, when we switch back, it takes another period of time to really\nwrap our minds around the original object of attention. And it\u2019s not only\nabout the time cost; it\u2019s about the quality of our attention. If we are always\nswitching from one thing to another, then we are never able to truly focus and\nexperience the pleasure and effectiveness of a focused mind. Instead we live\nin a state of constant recalibration, or what the writer Linda Stone\nperceptively calls \u201ccontinuous partial attention.\u201d\nHuman awareness is not the speedy, nimble creature some of us believe it\nto be. Our brains have evolved to be more like owls than hummingbirds: we\nnotice something, turn our attention to it, and focus in. It is in this state of\nintense, solitary focus that we are in possession of our most uniquely human\nand powerful mental faculties. When we focus on one thing, we are at our\nmost thoughtful, creative, and productive.\nBut in the screen-heavy environment of the twenty-first century, our mind-\nowls, large and unwieldy, are treated like hummingbirds, and they end up\nflopping ineffectively from one thing to the next. Doing this day in and day\nout accommodates us to what is actually an unnatural, anxiety-producing\nmode in which the mind struggles to find nourishment.\nWhich owl is going to feel busier, the one focusing on the sound of a\nmouse in the snow, or the one trying to draw tiny bits of nectar from a\nthousand flowers? And which owl is going to be, in the end, better\nnourished?\nONE FAMILY\u2019S LIFE OF ATTENTION\nKnowing that your attention is valuable is one thing, but what does\nattention look like in our relationships over the course of a lifetime?\nFor some real-world context, let\u2019s take a look at Leo DeMarco, our high\nschool teacher from Chapter Two, who was generally considered to be one\nof the Harvard Study\u2019s happiest men, and how he managed his time and\nattention.\nLeo was incredibly busy as a high school teacher and his time was\nstretched to the maximum. He was deeply involved with his students. More\ninvolved than most teachers, according to those who knew him. He always\nfelt there was more to do, and never hesitated to help a student who was\nhaving a hard time or to meet with a concerned parent. He was also involved\nin extracurricular activities and so was not always available to his own\nchildren after school or on the weekends. His family enjoyed his company\u2014\nhe was a good listener, and always ready with a well-timed joke\u2014so they\nnoticed when he wasn\u2019t around and sometimes wondered if he valued his\nwork more than his family.\nIt\u2019s true that his work was important to him. It gave his life meaning, and\nhe told the Study more than once that it made him feel like a valuable member\nof the community, like he meant something to the people he worked with and\nespecially to his students. This kind of purpose is important to our happiness\nand well-being (more on that in Chapter Nine), and it\u2019s not uncommon that it\ncomes into conflict with other priorities, like family time. This competition\nfor our attention is a tricky challenge that a lot of us find ourselves grappling\nwith. But it\u2019s not insurmountable.\nLeo\u2019s family was not afraid to share their feelings about this. His wife,\nGrace, mentioned it to him, and his two daughters and son mentioned it also.\nIn 1986 his oldest daughter, Katherine, was asked about the strongest\nmemories she had of Leo, and she talked with great feeling about their fishing\ntrips. Every summer, when he was not teaching, Leo would take one child at\na time for a week to different camping spots and fishing holes. During these\ntrips she remembered him being attentive to her, not just fishing, and asking\nabout her life and what she thought of things. Unable to turn off the teacher in\nhimself, he showed them how to tie on the hooks and bobbe rs, where the fish\nliked to hide out, how to build a fire, and how to identify constellations in the\nnight sky. He made sure they would all be able to camp and fish on their own,\nso they could handle themselves in the wilderness and continue the tradition\nwith their own kids, should they ever have them.\nLeo gave his children his focused attention, and he offered it to his wife,\nGrace, as well. In his early 80s, when Leo was asked what kinds of activities\nthey did together as a couple, he said:\nWe\u2019ll garden together or I\u2019ll just walk along with her and we just\ntalk about the landscape. I mean, yesterday we went for a three- or four-\nmile hike. Bundled up, deep in the woods , and we kept stopping and\nwatching the ducks fly out of the creek that we were crossing over.\nThere\u2019s a lot of that in my life. These are things that we share. Or when I\nread a book , I know what kinds of things appeal to her so I can suggest\nthat she take a look at something. And she does the same for me.\nThese are small things, small moments in the days of Leo and Grace\u2019s\nlife, but taken together over a lifetime, these small moments add up.\n\u201cAttention is the most basic form of love.\u201d It\u2019s not a coincidence that Leo is\nboth one of the more attentive, present members of the Study and one of its\nhappiest.\nTHE MODERN MEANS OF CONNECTION\nTo Leo and other First Generation Harvard Study participants who were\nraising their kids in the 1940s , 1950s , and 1960s , the online life we know in\nthe twenty-first century would have sounded like science fiction. Back then,\nthey didn\u2019t have to contend with the omnipresence of smartphones, the\npervasive nature of social media, or the overwhelming glut of information\nand stimuli. But their struggles with relationships might have more in\ncommon with the struggles of today than it first appears.\nIn 1946,  a young Stanley Kubrick published a photo in Look magazine\nthat would be very familiar today: a subway car full of New York City\ncommuters, heads bowed, nearly every single one of them absorbed in\u2026\ntheir newspapers. And many original Harvard Study families talked about\nhaving the same feelings many of us have today\u2014they struggled to give their\nfamilies the attention they deserved, work was overwhelming, the world\nseemed to be going crazy, and they were worried for their children\u2019s future.\nRemember, 89 percent of the Study\u2019s college men served in World War II\u2014a\ncatastrophic conflict the outcome of which, at the time, was entirely uncertain\n\u2014and then raised children amidst the Cold War and pervasive fears of\nnuclear disaster. Inside the home, instead of the internet, parents were\nworried about what television was doing to their kids, and to society in\ngeneral. So while their challenges might have been different in nature and\nscale, and the speed of cultural change may have been, at least in some ways,\nless extreme than what we experience, the effective solutions for nourishing\nrelationships\u2014de voting time and attention in the present moment\u2014were the\nsame as they are today. Attention is the actual stuff of life, and it\u2019s equally\nvaluable no matter what era a person lives in.\nOUR ATTENTION, ONLINE\nTechnologies like the smartphone and social media now play a role in\nshaping some of the most intimate parts of our lives. Quite often, when we\nconnect with another person, there is a device and a piece of software\nbetween us.\nThis is a vulnerable situation; an incredible amount of emotion and life\nflow through these media. The kindling of romance, breakups, news of births\nand deaths, the basic conduct of friendships, and all kinds of other intimate\ninteractions are now filtered through devices and software whose design\nsubtly\u2014and sometimes not-so-subtly\u2014shapes each interaction. How is this\naffecting our relationships? Our happiness? Are these new forms of\ncommunication deepening or inhibiting our ability to meaningfully connect\nto each other?\nDefinitive answers to these questions are not easy to come by. Every\nindividual uses these technologies differently, and as with any period of\nsocial transformation, the true nature of change is hard to see until we have\nsome distance to look back on it. But one thing we do know is that social\nmedia and online life are complicated. There are reasons to be hopeful, and\nreasons to worry.\nTHE GIVE-AND-TAKE OF SOCIAL MEDIA\nOn the positive side, when social media is used to sustain relationships\nwith friends and family, it can enhance feelings of connectedness and\nbelonging. Old friends and colleagues that we may have lost touch with in the\npast are now only a few clicks away, and new communities emerge every\nday around interests and challenges. Someone with a rare disease like cystic\nfibrosis can find support and comfort online, and someone who has been\nmarginalized because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or the way\nthey look can find a community beyond their physical location. For anyone\nwho is isolated and in an unusual situation, the internet is a true blessing.\nBut there are important questions to ask, and the answers may have\nimplications for our personal well-being and for society. Among the most\nurgent is how these online spaces affect the way children and adolescents\ndevelop. As data from our own Harvard Study (and many others) have\nshown, early social experiences matter. A person\u2019s style of relating to others\nlater in their life is linked to how they developed as children. We call them\nthe formative years for a reason (more on this in Chapter Eight). What\nimpact does more online interaction have on young people\u2019s ability to read\nsocial cues and recognize emotions in real life? Or on their ability to give\nmeaningful conversational cues and emotional signals? A great deal of in-\nperson communication has nothing to do with language. Do these nonverbal\nabilities atrophy in virtual contexts in ways that affect in-person interactions?\nThis is a rich and developing area of research, some of which we are\nconducting ourselves. The results so far are not conclusive; much more\nresearch must be done. But what\u2019s clear at this point is that we can\u2019t assume\nthat online spaces are the same as physical spaces, and we especially can\u2019t\nassume that the social skills kids develop by being together in person are\nskills they can also develop on line.\nISOLATION AND CONNECTION\nIn 2020 the world was rocked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The rapid\nspread of a microscopic virus drastically changed much of the world\u2019s way\nof life, separating us from our friends, neighbors, and families, and taxing our\nindividual psychological fortitude to the extreme. Quarantines drove people\ninto their homes, and social distancing rules prevented most forms of\nsocializing. Restaurants shut down. Workplaces closed. Almost overnight,\nonline video calls and social media became many people\u2019s only connection\nto the outside world. It was like a massive global experiment in both social\nisolation and the nature of life online.\nAs weeks of lockdown stretched into months, online tools began to fill\nthe void left by a lack of real-world interaction. Remote meetings kept many\nbusinesses afloat and allowed schools and universities to keep their (virtual)\ndoors open. Religious services were held online. Even weddings and\nfunerals were conducted virtually.\nBut for those who lacked internet access, the situation was more dire.\nFaced with total isolation or the risk of infection, many people chose to risk\ninfection. In nursing homes where social media and video calling were rare,\nthe only thing worse than the virus was the social isolation, which was so\ndamaging to residents\u2019 health that it became an official cause of death.\nWithout social media and video calling, it\u2019s likely that the health effects\nof the lockdown would have been much more severe.\nBut it soon became clear that these virtual tools were far from sufficient.\nSomething was missing in the feeling of these online meetings, in their\nsensory experience and emotional content.\nCommunication is not only an exchange of information. Human touch and\nphysical proximity have emotional, psychological, and even biological\neffects. Boxed in by the capabilities of software, the experience of social\ninteraction online is different and often more constrained. Whereas in normal\ntimes the limitations of online connection are offset by regular in-person\ninteractions, during the pandemic these limitations were placed into stark\nrelief. Despite our virtual connectedness, diseases of despair, depression,\nand anxiety increased in the first year of pandemic, and feelings of loneliness\nworsened in some communities. Even among those most well-connected\nonline, many began to experience \u201cskin hunger,\u201d a longing driven by the\ndeprivation of human touch. In the face of intense isolation, social media was\nat least something. But it wasn\u2019t enough.\nThis massive global experiment in isolation made one thing very clear:\nthe physical presence of another human being cannot be duplicated by a\nmachine. There is no substitute for being together.\nDON\u2019T SCROLL, ENGAGE\nSocial media and virtual interaction are here to stay, and they are likely\nto evolve in unpredictable ways. As we watch the way societies all over the\nworld cope with these technological changes, is there anything we can do in\nour own lives to magnify the good a nd mitigate the bad?\nThankfully, we do have some data on this. How an individual uses these\nplatforms matters, and we have a couple of very basic recommendations that\nyou can implement today:\nFirst, engage  with others.\nOne influential study showed that those who use Facebook  passively, just\nreading and scrolling, feel worse than those who engage actively by\ncontacting others and commenting on posts. A similar conclusion was\nreached in a study in Norway, one of the \u201chappiest\u201d countries on the planet.\nNorwegians use Facebook  at high rates, children especially, and one study\nfound that the kids who used Facebook  primarily to communicate\nexperienced more positive feelings. The kids who used it primarily to\nobserve experienced more negative feelings. These findings are not that\nsurprising: we now know that those who compare themselves to others more\nfrequently are less happy.\nAs we said earlier, we are always comparing our insides to other\npeople\u2019s outsides, always comparing our own experiences of ups and downs,\ngood days and bad days, feelings of confidence and insecurity, with the\ncurated version of life that others show us. This happens most starkly on\nsocial media, where we\u2019re quick to post photos of a good time at a restaurant\nor beach vacation, but rarely balance those out with the reality of dinner\ntable arguments or bad hangovers. This imbalance means that when we\ncompare our lives with the pictures that others show us on social media, it\u2019s\neasy to feel like the good life is something that only other people are\nenjoying.\nSecond, take your temperature when using social media.\nWhen it comes to social media, one size does not fit all. What\u2019s good for\nsomeone else may not be good for you. So when you\u2019re thinking about your\nown habits online, how you feel really matters. When you spend half an hour\non Facebook , do you come away feeling energized? Do you feel depleted\nafter a long click-hole journey around the internet? Taking a moment to notice\nthe changes in your mood and outlook after a period of time on Facebook  or\nTwitter can point you in the right direction. Next time you find yourself\npinned to your chair by a screen, just take a second and check in with\nyourself; how do y ou feel?\nThird, check in with how your social media use is seen by people who\nare important to you. Ask your partner how they feel about the way you use\nyour phone. Are your online habits affecting them? Are there certain times or\ncertain activities\u2014at breakfast, after dinner, in the car\u2014du ring which they\nmiss your full attention and presence? What about your kids? Older people\ntend to assume that it\u2019s primarily kids that are glued to screens, but it\u2019s not\nuncommon at all for kids to complain about their parents\u2019 obsession with\ntheir smartphones. This isn\u2019t something that you can always perceive\nyourself; you might need to ask.\nFinally, take tech holidays. These will vary depending on your life, but\nmaking a point to clear technology out of your life for small periods of time\ncan reveal how it is affecting you. In science, we use a control group to stand\nin relief against the treatment group so any effect can be clearly seen. In your\nlife, you might need a control period. What does it feel like to refrain from\nlooking at social media for four hours? If your phone is unavailable, are you\nmore attentive to the people you love? After a day free of social media, do\nyou feel less overwhelmed, less scattered?\nAnytime we pick up a smartphone or go online, we are increasing our\npotential reach and ope ning ourselves to vulnerabilities. The best that each of\nus can do is to try to understand how both sides of this equation map onto our\nown lives, and strive to maximize the good a nd mitigate the bad.\nTo that end, we have one crucial advantage over all of the tech giants: the\nwar for our attention is being fought on our home turf; quite literally, in our\nminds. And it can be won there.\nBEING (AND STAYING) ALERT\nThe present moment is the only time over which we have\ndominion.\nThich Nhat Hanh\nThese dilemmas of attention may seem unique to the modern moment, but\nat their core they are very old, millennia older than the internet, and they have\nvery old solutions.\nIn 1979, Jon Kabat-Zinn adapted ancient Buddhist meditation practices\ninto an eight-session course designed to help terminally ill patients and those\nwith chronic pain reduce feelings of stress. He called the course\n\u201cMindfulness-Based Stress Reduction,\u201d or MBSR, and its therapeutic\nsuccess led to the word \u201cmindfulness\u201d becoming the almost ubiquitous term\nit is today. A great deal of research now supports its effectiveness, and a\nlarge number of medical schools now offer mindfulness training.\nAt its core the practice of mindfulness is about alertness and attention.\nKabat-Zinn often defines mindfulness in this way: \u201cthe awareness that\nemerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-\njudgmentally to things as they are.\u201d By making a conscious effort to pay\nattention to the sensations of our bodi es and what is happening around us, and\ndoing it without the abstraction and filter of judgment, our thinking and\nexperience are brought into sync with where we are right now. The human\nmind has a tendency to run away; the goal of mindfulness is to keep bringing\nit back home, to the present moment.\nOver the years, elements of mindfulness have permeated the broader\nculture, and efforts to commercialize it have led some to distrust mindfulness\npractices. But its core concepts have been around for centuries and are part\nof many cultural traditions. The goal is simply an everyday sort of\nattentiveness. Even the U.S. military is invested in mindfulness and learning\nhow to keep human beings focused, because being alert to the moment, for a\nsoldier, is a matter of life and death.\nThe same can be said for the rest of us. Being alert is the feeling of\nactually living. Accumulated moments of autopilot (for example, a mindless\ndaily commute plus hours of surfing the internet plus the automatic routines\naround waking and going to sleep) contribute to the feeling that life is racing\nby and that we\u2019re missing it as it happens.\nBy learning to pay attention to what\u2019s happening in front of us, we gain\nmore than the sensations of life; we also increase our ability to act. We\u2019re not\nthinking about what\u2019s already happened, about what might happen, about\nwhat we have to do later; we are alert to the moment, which is where any\naction must take place. If our intention is to connect with other people, being\npresent is what makes that possible.\nA moment of mindfulness needn\u2019t be a strenuous act of meditation. We\nneed only to stop, pay attention, and notice things as they are. An amazing\namount of information is available in every fleeting moment of our lives. You\ncan take a moment right now, in the place you are. You can notice the weight\nof this book in your hand, the feel of the page (or of the device you are using\nto read or listen to it), the movement of the air across your skin, or the play of\nlight on the floor of the room. Or you can try asking yourself this lovely\nquestion, which is useful in any situation, at any time: What\u2019s here that I\u2019ve\nnever noticed before?\nThe word \u201cmindfulness\u201d is unfortunate in a way, because its meaning may\nnot be evident to some people. The word seems to suggest that the practice is\nabout thinking the right things, that if we are mindful it means our mind is\n\u201cfull\u201d of the right thoughts.\nBut mindfulness is simpler than that.\nAs the Gilbert and Killingsworth study showed, more often than not, most\npeople\u2019s minds are already full of thought\u2014about ourselves, the future, and\nthe past. This kind of thinking pulls our minds into a narrow tunnel made of\nthought and worry, cut off from immediate experience. It can be dark and\nclaustrophobic there.\nThe present moment is large and spacious, if we allow it to be. Even\nwhen it contains sad or scary experiences, this moment includes so much\nmore than the content of our minds. The sense of being truly alive comes with\ngiving our attention only to what is happening right in front of us, to grab hold\nof sensations\u2014the feelings of our bodies, the things we see and hear, the\npresence of the people who are with us\u2014and use them to make a hard left out\nof thinking about other things and places, and to emerge from the tunnel of our\nown minds into the vastness of the present, the only place anything, or\nanyone, really exists.\nAs the spiritualist Ram Dass simply put it, the idea is to \u201cbe here now.\u201d\n\u201cA\u201d FOR EFFORT\nThat same question\u2014W hat\u2019s here that I\u2019m not noticing?\u2014can be\nextraordinarily powerful when we apply it to people: What about this person\nhave I not noticed before? Or: What is this person feeling that I\u2019ve been\nmissing? This is part of that radical curiosity we talked about in Chapter\nFour.\nMore often than not, when we are in the presence of other people, we are\nmissing a lot about their experience. In any interaction, and in any\nrelationship (even our closest), there is an enormous amount of feeling and\ninformation that goes right over our heads. But in the end, which matters\nmore: How right we are about what another person is experiencing, or how\ncurious we are about their experience in the first place?\nIn 2012 the two of us designed a study to help work this out. If you\u2019ve\never had a difficult conversation with a romantic partner, you know how\nfraught that can be, and how much misunderstanding can go on. So we\nrecruited 156 couples from diverse backgrounds, and asked each partner to\nrecord a one- or two-sentence summary about a relationship event in the past\nmonth that frustrated, angered, or disappointed them (for example, the partner\ndid not follow through on something they had promised, did not share\ninformation about an important event, did not do a household task that was\ntheirs to do). Then we played each partner\u2019s recording for the couple to\ninitiate a discussion, and we instructed them to try to come to a better\nunderstanding of what occurred.\nThe participants didn\u2019t know this, but we were tracking the importance of\nempathy. What we wanted to know was this: Is it more important to be\naccurate in our understanding of our partner\u2019s feelings, or is it more\nimportant that our partners see that we are making an effort to unde rstand?\nAfter their interaction, we asked them about both their own and their\npartner\u2019s feelings during these conversations. We also asked a series of\nquestions about their partner\u2019s intentions and motivations, including the\ndegree to which they felt their partner was trying to understand them.\nWe expected that empathic accuracy\u2014getting the right answer about\nwhat your partner was feeling\u2014would correlate with a stronger sense of\nrelationship satisfaction. This correlation was certainly there\u2014understanding\nhow your partner is feeling is a good t hing.\nBut more important than that, especially for women, was the empathic\neffort involved. If a person felt their partner was making a good-faith effort\nto understand them, they felt more positively about the interaction and about\nthe relationship, regardless of their partner\u2019s accuracy.\nTo put it simply, understanding another person is great, but just trying to\nunde rstand goes a long way in building connection.\nSome people do this automatically, but efforts to understand others can\nalso be deliberate, intentional behaviors. It needn\u2019t come naturally to you at\nfirst, but the more you try, the easier it will get. The next time you have the\noppor tunity, try asking yourself:\nHow is this person feeling?\nWhat is this person thinking?\nAm I missing something he re?\nHow might I feel if I were in this person\u2019s shoes?\nAnd when you can, let them know that you\u2019re curious and trying to\nunderstand\u2014a  small effort that can have an enormous impact.\nLEO GETS A B+ FOR EFFORT\nLeo may not have been the Study member who spent the most time with\nhis family, but over the years he made a conscious attempt to improve in that\narea, and when he did spend time with them, he made it count. That doesn\u2019t\nmean that he took them on spectacular adventures or international trips, or\nthat he crammed the maximum amount of excitement into every moment of\nfamily time. No. He paid attention to his children and his wife and he did so\nrelatively consistently. He was available to them, in the moment. He listened,\nhe asked questions, and he made a point to help whenever he could.\nWe asked him what had appealed to him about his wife when they first\nmet in high school, and he listed a number of things: her intelligence, her ease\nof manner, and something mysterious that he couldn\u2019t put his finger on\u2014\u201cjust\nsomething that I liked about her. I liked her right from the start.\u201d But when we\nasked him what he thought she liked about him, the question startled him.\n\u201cWell I\u2019ve never thought about that, to be honest,\u201d he said. He was so\ninterested in Grace that he hadn\u2019t thought about how he appeared to her.\nThis focus on the world outside of himself is a theme in Leo\u2019s life. When\nhis family all got together, he said he enjoyed being a fly on the wall. Their\nrelationships with each other were fun for him to watch, to see them in their\nnatural states, how they were different with each other than with him. Their\nrelationships infused the household with energy. \u201cIt makes life wonderful,\u201d\nhe said.\nLeo was lucky. His curiosity, attention to others, and lack of self-\nconsciousness were natural for him. These do not come as naturally to\neveryone. Some of us have to make a more deliberate effort and learn to be\nattentive in this way. Even Leo, who remained attentive to his wife\nthroughout his life, didn\u2019t keep up his proactive approach to connecting with\nhis children. He talked with them less and less after they left home, and in\ngeneral was less attentive. When she was in her mid-30s, his youngest\ndaughter, Rachel, wrote an unprompted note on her Second Generation\nquestionnaire:\nAdore both parents. Just realized this year that I have to carve time out to be with them,\nespecially to get my father to talk. He has always let my mother do the necessary\ncommunicating. Now I initiate great late-night conversations, and feel much closer to him.\nThis comment is very revealing. The DeMarco family was close to each\nother, it\u2019s true, but sometimes that\u2019s not enough. After Rachel became an\nadult, she lost some of that closeness with her parents in a way that didn\u2019t\nfeel good to her. She had to become more active in making time for them, and\nin nurturing her relationship with her father. As a family, they already had the\nability to communicate and to be close, and yet effort and planning were still\nnecessary. Closeness didn\u2019t just happen on its own. Life is busy. So many\nthings get in the way, and it\u2019s easy to become passive and just go with the\nflow. Rachel made a choice to move against the flow of her life and\nreconnect.\nRachel\u2019s choice didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. Leo may not have known it\nwhen he was a young father, but he was sowing the seeds of connection that\nwould come back and nourish him (and his kids) later in life. Rachel and his\nother children learned that this kind of connection with their father felt good\nand gave their lives a special feeling they couldn\u2019t easily get from anyone\nelse. They knew this because of Leo\u2019s earlier efforts.\nAt the very end of her questionnaire, Rachel made a final note to Study\nresearchers:\np.s. Sorry this is late, I live in the deep woods on a mountain, no H2O, electricity, etc. A bit\ncut-off!\n\u2026 so it seems more than one lesson from their camping trips took hold.\nA close look at the DeMarco family reveals what research also shows\nare some of the natural outgrowths of focused attention: reciprocal love\nand consideration, a sense of belonging, and positive feeling about  human\nrelationships in general\u2014which then leads to more positive relationships,\nand better health. In the case of Leo and the DeMarco family, their close\nattention to each other seems to have had a major impact on all of their lives.\nA LITTLE MORE ATTENTION, EVERY DAY\nWe\u2019ve already asked you to consider the relationships in your life that\ncould use some more time. Now we\u2019re going to ask you to consider a deeper\nquestion: Of the people in your life who are already receiving your time,\nwho among them is receiving your full attention?\nThis question may be more difficult to answer than you think. We often\nbelieve that we are giving our full attention, but our automatic actions and\nreactions make it hard to know for sure. You might have to make an effort to\nobserve yourself and to consider if you really are offering the people who\nare most important to you the fullness of your attention.\nHow you do this will be particular to your own life, but here are a few\nsimple ways to begin.\nFirst, think of one or two relationships that enrich your life, and consider\ndevoting some extra attention to them. If you made a social universe chart in\nChapter Four, you might take a look at it and ask yourself, What action could\nI take today  to give attention and appreciation to someone who deserves\nit?\nSecond, consider some changes to your day. Is it practical to create some\ntime or activities that are distraction-free, particularly when you are with the\npeople you care most about? For example, no phones at the dinner table? Are\nthere set times in the week or in the month that you can dedicate to a certain\nperson? Can a change in your daily schedule lead to a regular time for coffee\nor a walk with a loved one or a new friend? Can you arrange a few pieces of\nfurniture to facilitate conversation rather than facilitate screen time?\nFinally, you might continue the practice we began in Chapter Four, and\nbring some curiosity to each moment you have with the people in your life,\nespecially those you know well and perhaps take for granted. This takes\npractice, but it\u2019s not hard to get better at it. \u201cHow was your day?\u201d\u2014\u201cFine\u201d\nneedn\u2019t be the end of a conversation. It is your sincere interest that will\nmotivate folks to respond. You might follow up with something a little more\nplayful like, \u201cWhat was the most fun thing that happe ned today ?\u201d Or, \u201cDid\nanything surprising happe n today ?\u201d And when someone makes a casual\nreply you can dig deeper: \u201cCan I ask you more about  that\u2026 I\u2019m so curious\nand not sure I really unde rstand it fully\u2026\u201d Try to put yourself in this\nperson\u2019s place and imagine what they have experienced. Engaging\nconversations often come from this perspective-taking alone, and curiosity\ncan be contagious. You might find that the more interested you are in others,\nthe more interested they become in you, and you might also be surprised how\nfun this process can be.\nLife is always at risk of slipping by unnoticed. If the days and months and\nyears feel as if they are moving too quickly, focused attention might be one\nremedy. Giving something your undivided attention is a way of bringing it to\nlife and assuring that you don\u2019t float through time on automatic pilot. Noticing\nsomeone is a way of respecting them, paying tribute to the person they are in\nthat exact moment. And noticing yourself, checking in about how you move\nthrough the world, about where you are now and where you would like to be,\ncan help you identify which people and pursuits most need your attention.\nAttention is your most precious asset, and deciding how to invest it is one of\nthe most important decisions you can make. The good news is you can make\nthat decision now, in this moment, and in each moment of your life.\n  6  \nFACING THE MUSIC\nAdapting to Challenges in Your Relationships\nThere is a crack, a crack in everything\nThat\u2019s how  the light gets in.\nLeonard Cohen\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1985, S ection VI\nQ#8: What is your philosophy for getting over the rough spots?\nAt age 26, Peggy Keane seemed to everyone who knew her to be well on\nthe path to a good life. She had a promising career, and a loving family. We\nheard from her in Chapter Three as she told us about her marriage to a man\nshe described as \u201cone of the nicest men on the planet.\u201d But this picture of her\nlife did not match the deeper reality. Only a few months after her wedding,\nPeggy\u2019s life fell into disarray when she acknowledged to herself, her husband,\nand her family that she was gay. Peggy had been hiding this truth about herself\nfor years, and when she finally turned to face it, her entire world seemed to\ncollapse. She felt alone, out of energy, and out of resources. It was the most\ndifficult moment of her life. When she came up for air after that period of\nconfusion and despair, she looked around at her life and thought, What now?\nWho can I turn to?\nThroughout this book , we\u2019ve been emphasizing that relationships are the\nkey not only to navigating difficulties, big and small, but to flourishing in the\nface of them. George Vaillant summed this point up well when he wrote:\n\u201cThere are two pillars of happiness revealed by the [Harvard Study].\u2026 One\nis love. The other is finding a way of coping with life that does not push love\naway.\u201d\nIt is within our relationships\u2014and especially our close relationships\u2014\nthat we find the ingredients of the good life. But getting there isn\u2019t simple.\nWhen we look across the eighty-four years of the Harvard Study, we can see\nthat the happiest and healthiest participants were those with the best\nrelationships. But when we examine the lowest moments in our participants\u2019\nlives, a great deal of them also involve relationships. Divorces, the death of\nloved ones, challenges with drugs and alcohol that pushed key relationships to\nthe brink\u2026 many of the hardest times in participants\u2019 lives have been the\nresult of their love for and closeness to other people.\nIt\u2019s one of the great ironies of life\u2014and the subject of millions of songs,\nfilms, and great works of literature\u2014that the people who make us feel the\nmost alive and who know us best are also the people able to hurt us most.\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that the people who hurt us are malicious, or that we are\nacting maliciously when we hurt others. Sometimes there is no fault. As we\ntravel on our own unique paths, we can hurt each other without intending to.\nThis is the conundrum we find ourselves in as human beings, and how we\ndeal with challenges often defines the course of our lives. Do we face the\nmusic? Or do w e bury our heads in the sand?\nWhat did Peggy do?\nLet\u2019s fast-forward in Peggy\u2019s life to March of 2016, shortly after her 50th\nbirthday, and take a look at how things worked out for her.\nThroughout the 1990s , Peggy focused on her career. She completed a\nmaster\u2019s degree and started teaching. After one short relationship and a period\nof being single, Peggy fell in love in 2001 and has been in a close relationship\nwith the same woman ever since. She describes her relationship as \u201cvery\nhappy, warm, and comfortable.\u201d But in 2016 she\u2019d been having some trouble\nat work, and the stress was affecting her life:\nQ1: In the last month, how often have you been upset because of something that happened\nunexpectedly?\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003R arely\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003 Often \u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nQ2: How often have you felt nervous and stressed?\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003R arely\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003 Often \u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nBut even though she\u2019d been under pressure, Peggy wasn\u2019t particularly\nworried:\nQ3: How often have you felt confident about your ability to handle your personal problems?\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003R arely\u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003 Often \u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nQ4: How often have you felt difficulties piling up so high that you could not overcome them?\nNever\u2003\u2003\u2003 Rarely \u2003\u2003\u2003S ometimes\u2003\u2003\u2003O ften\u2003\u2003\u2003A lways\nWhat were the reasons for Peggy\u2019s confidence in tackling problems?

Because of her full engagement\nwith the people who are close to her, she\u2019s lived, as Zen Buddhists sometimes\nsay, \u201cthe ten thousand joys and the ten thousand sorrows.\u201d\nAs we travel along our individual paths, one of the few things we can be\nabsolutely sure of is that we will face challenges in life and in our\nrelationships that we don\u2019t feel equipped to handle. The lives of two\ngenerations of Harvard Study participants broadcast this truth loudly and\nclearly. It doesn\u2019t matter how wise, how experienced, or how capable we are;\nwe will sometimes feel overmatched. And yet if we are willing to face into\nthese challenges, there is a tremendous amount that can be done. \u201cYou can\u2019t\nstop the waves,\u201d Jon Kabat-Zinn wrote, \u201cbut you can learn to surf.\u201d\nIn Chapter Five, we talked about the importance of paying attention to the\npresent moment, and the incredible value of directing that attentiveness\ntoward the people in our lives. Now the question becomes: What happens\nwhen we find ourselves in that present moment, engaged with people and\nexperiencing significant challenges? Life happens only in the moment. If\nwe\u2019re going to face the music, we have to do it one moment at a time, one\ninteraction at a time, one feeling at a time.\nThis chapter is about these moment-to-moment choices and interactions,\nabout living with and adapting to challenges in our relationships and in life,\nso that when the waves come crashing our way, rather than succumbing to\nthem, we can meet them with all of the resources at our disposal, and ride.\nREFLEXIVE VS. REFLECTIVE\nMany difficulties in relationships stem from old habits. We develop\nautomatic, reflexive behaviors over the course of our lives that become so\nintimately woven into our days that we don\u2019t even see them. In some cases,\nwe become used to avoiding certain feelings and turning away, while in other\ncases we might be so overcome by emotion that we act on our feelings before\nwe realize it.\nThe old phrase \u201cknee-jerk reaction\u201d is apt. When a doctor taps our knee in\njust the right spot, our nerves react and our foot kicks up. No thought or\nconscious effort is involved. Emotions often seem to affect us in the same\nway. A great deal of research has shown that once an emotion is elicited, our\nreactions are almost automatic. Emotional reactions are complex but include\nwhat researchers have called an \u201caction tendency\u201d\u2014an urge to behave in a\ncertain way. Fear, for example, includes an urge to escape. Emotions have\nevolved to enable rapid responses, particularly when we feel threatened. So\nwhen humans lived primarily in the wilderness, action tendencies had a strong\nsurvival benefit. Now things are less straightforward.\nWhen Bob was a medical student, he encountered two cases that put into\nrelief a crucial difference between more adaptive and less adaptive ways of\ncoping with stress. Both involved women in their late 40s, each of whom had\nfound a lump in her breast. We\u2019ll call them Abigail and Lucia. Abigail\u2019s\ninitial reaction to the lump was to minimize its significance, and to tell no one.\nIt was probably nothing, she decided. It was small, and whatever it was, it\nwasn\u2019t important. She didn\u2019t want to bother her husband or her two sons, who\nwere away at college and busy with their own lives. After all, she felt fine\nand had other things to worry about.\nLucia\u2019s initial reaction was alarm. She told her husband, and after a brief\nconversation they agreed she should call her doctor and schedule an\nimmediate appointment. Then she called her daughter and let her know what\nwas going on. While she waited for the biopsy results to come back, she did\nher best to put it out of her mind so that she could get on with her life. She had\na career, and other things to deal with. But her daughter called every day and\nher husband dot ed on her to the point that she had to ask him for some space.\nAbigail and Lucia were both responding to an incredible stressor in ways\nthat were natural for them. We all do this. Our habitual responses\u2014pa tterns of\nboth thinking and behaving\u2014that arise when stressful events occur are what\npsychologists call coping styles.\nOur coping styles affect the way we deal with every challenge that comes\nour way, from a minor disagreement to major catastrophe, and a key part of\nevery coping style is how we use our relationships. Do we seek help? Do we\naccept help? Do we turn inward and face challenges in silence? Whatever\ncoping style we use has an impact on those around us.\nThe coping styles of the two women that Bob encountered in his medical\ntraining could not have been more different. Abigail managed her fear by\ndenying the significance of what she had discovered, and in this way she\nfaced away from the difficulty. She did not involve her loved ones and did not\ntake any action. She saw her situation as a potential burden on others. Lucia\nwas also afraid, but she used her fear to face toward the difficulty and to take\nthe actions necessary to preserve her health. She saw her situation as a matter\nthat was larger than herself, something her family should face together. She\nleaned in to the situation, dealt with it directly, but remained flexible as well,\nmanaging the ebb and flow of the other demands of her life.\nIt turned out that both of these women had cancer. Abigail never told her\nfamily or her doctor what she had found and ignored the lump until she began\nto feel ill. By then it was too late, and the cancer took her life. Lucia caught\nthe cancer early, went through a long course of treatment, and survived.\nThis is an extreme example, but this contrast in outcomes stuck with Bob\nfor the clarity of its message: the inability or refusal to face challenges\ndirectly and to engage your support network can have enormous\nconsequences.\nFACING THE MUSIC VS. BURYING OUR\nHEADS IN THE SAND\nAbigail\u2019s case is not unusual at all. Marc has helped run two separate\nstudies designed to help women with breast cancer deal more directly with\ntheir fears and to access the support of important people in their lives. Among\nthese women, Abigail\u2019s initial reaction\u2014avoidanc e\u2014was common.\nIt\u2019s often easier to turn away than it is to confront what troubles us. But\ndoing so can have unintended consequences, and the effect of avoidance can\nbe especially pronounced in the place it happens most: our personal\nrelationships.\nMany studies have shown that when we avoid confronting challenges in a\nrelationship, not only does the problem not go away, but it can get worse. The\noriginal problem keeps burrowing down into the relationship and can lead to\na variety of other problems.\nThis has been clear to psychologists for a long time, but what has been\nless clear is how this kind of avoidance can affect us over the course of life.\nDoes a tendency to avoid dealing with challenges affect us only in the short\nterm, or are there long-term consequences?\nTo get a lifetime perspective on this question, we used data from the\nHarvard Study and asked, What happe ns over the course of an entire life\nwhen a participant tends to face the music (lean in), and what happe ns\nwhen they tend to bury their heads in the sand (avoid)? We found that a\ntendency to avoid thinking and talking about difficulties in middle age was\nassociated with negative consequences more than thirty years later. Those\npeople whose typical responses were to avoid or ignore difficulties had\npoorer memory and were less satisfied with their lives in late life than those\nwho tended to face difficulties directly.\nOf course, life is always bringing us new and different challenges. What\nserved you well yesterday might not work today, and different kinds of\nrelationships require different skills. The friendly joking to lighten an\nargument with your teenage child probably will not work with your neighbor\nwho asks you to curb your dog. During a heated exchange at home, you might\ntake your partner\u2019s hand; at work your boss might not appreciate the same\ngesture. We need to cultivate a variety of tools and use the right tool for the\nright challenge.\nOne lesson from research is that there are advantages to being flexible.\nThere are men and women in the Harvard Study who are incredibly strong-\nwilled. They have set ways of responding to challenges, and they stick to\nthem. In some situations, they may find themselves in control, but in others\nthey may be at a loss.\nIt was not uncommon in the 1960s , for example, for our First Generation\nStudy participants to have difficulty finding common ground with their baby\nboom er children. This inability to adapt caused them stress.\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that hippy movement,\u201d Sterling Ainsley told the Study in\n1967. \u201cIt disturbs me.\u201d He found himself alienated from his children, unable\nto be curious about their different views of the world.\nEach of us has cultivated certain coping strategies through our lives, and\nthey can become set in stone. This kind of \u201cstrength\u201d can actually make us\nmore fragile. In an earthquake, the sturdiest, most rigid structures are not the\nones that survive. In fact, they might be the first to crumble. Structural science\nhas figured this out, and building codes now require flexibility in tall\nstructures, so that buildings are able to ride the literal wave rolling through\nthe earth. The same with human beings. Being able to flex with changing\ncircumstance is an incredibly powerful skill to learn. It might be the\ndifference between getting through with minor damage and falling apart.\nChanging our own automatic way of responding is not an easy thing to do.\nThere are brilliant people in the Harvard Study\u2014actual rocket scientists\u2014\nwho never managed even to recognize, much less control, their own coping\nstrategies, and their lives were poorer for it. At the same time, participants\nlike Peggy Keane, and her parents, Henry and Rosa, were able to grow by\nfacing the trials of their lives as squarely as they could, and by using the\nsupport of friends and family.\nSo how do we move beyond our initial reactions when confronted by\nchallenges?\nWhen we are in the throes of emotional events, pos itive or negative, minor\nor major, our reactions often unfold so fast that we experience our emotions as\nif they are happening to us, and we are at their mercy. But in truth, our\nemotions are much more affected by our thinking than we realize.\nThere is now a great deal of research showing the connection between\nhow we perceive events and how we feel about them. Humans understood this\nlong before science developed the objective evidence.\n\u201cA happy heart is good medicine and a cheerful mind works healing,\u201d the\nBible says, \u201cbut a broken spirit dries up the bones\u201d (Proverbs 17:22).\nThe Stoic philosopher Epictetus noted that \u201cMen are disturbed not by\nevents, but by the views they take of them.\u201d\n\u201cMonks,\u201d the Buddha said, \u201cwe who look at the whole and not just the\npart, know that we too are systems of interdependence, of feelings,\nperceptions, thoughts, and consciousness all interconnected.\u201d\nOur emotions need not be our masters; what we think, and how we\napproach each event in our lives, matters.\nONE MOMENT AT A TIME\nIf we take any emotional sequence\u2014a stressor that evokes a feeling that\nelicits a reaction and its aftermath\u2014and we zoom in and slow the sequence\nway down, a new hidden level of processing is revealed. Just as medical\nresearchers find treatments for illness by looking at the smallest processes in\nthe body , some surprising possibilities become available to us when we\nexamine our emotional experience at a more microscopic level.\nThis process\u2014from stressor to reaction\u2014happens in stages. Each stage\npresents us with a range of choices that can propel us in a more positive or\nmore negative direction, and each stage can be altered by our thinking or\nbehavior.\nScientists have mapped these stages and used these maps to help children\ncurb aggression, to help adults reduce depression, and to help athletes\nperform at peak efficiency. But these maps are useful for anyone in any\nemotional situation. By understanding how we move through these stages, and\nslowing them down, we can illuminate some of the mysteries behind why we\nfeel the way we feel and do t he things we do.\nThe model that follows provides a way for you to slow your reactions and\nput them under a microscope. We offer it as something you can keep in your\nback pocket (metaphorically) and use anytime, for any emotional situation.\nOur main focus in this book  is on relationships, so we present examples of\nhow this model can be used to respond to challenging experiences with other\npeople. But it can be applied to challenges of all sorts\u2014to unexpected and\nminor irritants like getting a flat tire, or to chronic health stressors like\ndiabetes or arthritis. One moment at a time.\nTHE W.I.S.E.R. MODEL OF REACTING TO EMOTIONALLY CHALLENGING\nSITUATIONS AND RELATIONSHIP EVENTS\nThis model downshifts our typical reactions one or two gears and gives us\na chance to look more closely at the rich particulars of situations, the\nexperiences of other people, and our own reactions that we may have been\nmissing.\nTo show you how this model can be used in everyday life, we\u2019ll use a\nscenario we see a lot, both in our clinical practices and among participants in\nthe Harvard Study: a family member who offers unwelcome advice.\nImagine a mother, we\u2019ll call her Clara, who has been having difficulty\nconnecting with her teenage daughter, Angela. Angela is fifteen, and as most\nfifteen-year-olds do, she\u2019s striving to become more independent. She feels\nstifled by her mother and father and wants to spend time only with her friends.\nAngela has been a good student most of her life, but in the last year her grades\nhave been slipping, she\u2019s been caught drinking several times, and she\u2019s been\nskipping classes, all of which have caused fights at home.\nAngela\u2019s grandparents are sympathetic\u2014Clara was defiant at that age\nherself\u2014and they try to be supportive and leave the parenting to Clara. But\nClara\u2019s older sister, Frances, also has teenage kids and thinks that Angela\u2019s\nparents are failing her. Aunt Frances worries about where Angela\u2019s headed\nand feels like it might be her duty to intervene.\nAt a family barbecue, Frances sees her niece Angela at the end of the\npicnic table, disengaged, texting with friends. \u201cYou know, smartphones kill\nthe brain,\u201d she says, jokingly. \u201cThey\u2019ve basically proved it in the lab.\u201d Then\nshe says to her sister Clara, her tone still trying to communicate humor but\nwith a hint of seriousness, \u201cYou wonder why her grades are slipping, maybe\nyou should try disciplining her, take the phone away. That\u2019s what I do with my\nkids. Maybe then she\u2019ll have time for schoolwork.\u201d\nOkay\u2014so how could Clara use the W.I.S.E.R. model to help her decide\nhow to respond to her sister?\nStage One: Watch (Curiosity Cures the Cat)\nThere\u2019s an old adage in psychiatry: Don\u2019t just do s omething, sit there.\nOur initial impressions of a situation are powerful, but they are rarely\ncomplete. We tend to focus on the familiar, and this narrow view risks\nexcluding potentially important information. Regardless of how much you can\nobserve initially, there is almost always more to see. Whenever you encounter\na stressor and you feel the emotion brewing, a bit of purposeful curiosity right\naway is useful. Thoughtful observation can round out our initial impressions,\nexpand our view of a situation, and press the pause button to prevent a\npotentially harmful reflexive response.\nIn Clara\u2019s case, taking a moment to watch won\u2019t be easy. She has a long\nhistory of fraught interactions with her sister, and her first reaction is to feel\ninsulted. Frances\u2019s comment hurts, because Clara feels some shame about her\ninability to reach Angela, her inability to connect. Her knee-jerk response\nmight be to snap and sarcastically reply with something like, \u201cThanks for the\nawesome advice, now how about you mind your own business!\u201d From there,\nan argument might ensue. Another response might be to say nothing, keep her\nfeelings inside, run over the comment again and again in her mind, and harbor\nher resentment and shame until she\u2019s furious by the time of the next family get-\ntogether.\nWatch refers to the entire situation: the environment, the person you\u2019re\ninteracting with, and you. Is the situation unusual or common? What typically\nhappens next? What have I not considered that might be an important part of\nwhat is unfolding?\nFor Clara, this might mean thinking about how her sister experiences these\nfamily functions. Maybe Frances is not comfortable around Clara because\nClara has always been \u201cthe cool aunt.\u201d Or there could be some stress in\nFrances\u2019s life, such as concern about their mother\u2019s health, that has nothing to\ndo with what\u2019s happening in the moment. This watch phase might take some\ntime and even extend over the next hour or so. Clara might let Frances\u2019s\ncomment go in the moment and then ask her mother what she thought was\ngoing on there. If she did this, she might learn that Frances has been having\nfights with her husband, or that she\u2019s feeling pressured at work. This kind of\nconsideration is not meant to excuse behavior, but simply to flesh out the\ncontext of what\u2019s happening. Context is incredibly valuable. It never hurts to\ntake in as much information as possible, beyond what you notice right away.\nThe curiosity that we muster during the watch phase also includes\ncuriosity about your own emerging reactions\u2014how you\u2019re feeling, and why.\nYou might notice what\u2019s happening in your body , that your heart is beating\nfaster, that you\u2019re pursing your lips or gritting your teeth (signs of anger). You\nmight notice an impulse to lash out or to hide yourself because you feel\nashamed. Becoming more conscious of how you react and what you might be\nabout to do can help you ride that wave of emotion rather than having it crash\nover you.\nThis leads us to the second stage, which is a critical turning point in\nresponse to stress: interpreting what the situation means for you.\nStage Two: Interpret (Naming the Stakes)\nIt is in this stage where things often go wrong.\nInterpreting is something we are all doing, all the time, whether we know\nit or not; we look around at the world, at what is happening to us, and we\nassess why those things are happening, and what it means for us. Of course,\nwe build this assessment on reality, but reality is not always so clear-cut.\nEach of us perceives and interprets a situation in our own way, so what we\nsee as \u201creality\u201d may not be what other people see. One of the major pitfalls is\nthinking that a situation is all about us; it rarely is.\nIf you want to understand a situation as clearly as possible, you first need\nto make sense of what\u2019s at stake for you. Emotion is usually a sign that there is\nsomething important going on for you; if there wasn\u2019t, you wouldn\u2019t be feeling\nanything. An emotion could be related to an important goal in your life, a\nparticular insecurity, or a relationship you cherish. Asking the question, Why\nam I getting emotional? is a good way to figure out what\u2019s at stake for you. If\nyou see the stakes clearly, you may be able to interpret the situation more\nskillfully.\nBob refers to this stage as \u201cfilling in the blank.\u201d Because our observation\nof a situation is rarely complete, we often jump to conclusions about what we\ndon\u2019t know. Many situations are ambiguous and unclear, and it is on this\ncanvas of ambiguity that we can project all sorts of ideas. If we\u2019ve only done\na quick-and-dirty job of observing in the watch stage, we probably don\u2019t have\nall the information we could have about what\u2019s really going on, which leads\nto hasty conclusions.\nIn Clara\u2019s case, she might think, Why did that comment make me so mad?\nIs this about  my sister, or abou t my difficulties with Angela, or just about\nAngela? M y feelings are incredibly strong\u2014 why is this so important to me?\nConsidering her sister, she might think, Is Frances doing this on purpose\nto hurt me or is she doing this because she really thinks she\u2019s going to help\nAngela? Is it because she resents that I don\u2019t encourage her to be more\ninvolved in Angela\u2019s life? Is it possible that she doesn\u2019t feel valued in the\nfamily as the elder sister who has  useful advice?\nWhen we fill in the blanks, we sometimes make mountains out of\nmolehills. It often happens that we snag on negative aspects of a stressor and\nturn something small and manageable into something enormous and\noverwhelming.\nJust asking the question\u2014What is it I\u2019m assuming here?\u2014can bring what\nlooks like a mountain closer into line with its molehill reality. Assumptions\nare the source of an incredible amount of misunderstanding. As the old saying\ngoes, Never assume, because when you assume, you make an ass of u and\nme.\nBut it\u2019s also possible to err in the oppos ite direction and make true\nmountains into molehills, as in the example of Abigail, who found a lump in\nher breast and told no one. If we\u2019re trying to minimize or avoid thinking about\na big problem, we might ignore it entirely.\nThe important thing in the interpret stage is to expand our understanding\nbeyond our initial automatic perception. To consider more perspectives, even\nif those perspectives are uncomfortable. To ask, What might I be overlooking\nhere?\nAgain, this is a place where some attention to our own emotions can be\nhelpful. When you feel a pulse of fear, a pulse of anger, or a sinking feeling in\nyour stomach, think of it as a signal to inject some healthy curiosity into the\nsituation, to ponder not only the stressor itself, but also your own emotional\nreality: Why am I feeling this way? Where are these emotions coming from?\nWhat is really at stake? What is so challenging for me about  this situation?\nStage Three: Select (Choosing from the Options)\nYou\u2019ve made a point to watch, you\u2019ve interpreted (and then reinterpreted)\nthe situation and expanded your view; now the question becomes, What\nshould I do?\nWhen we are under stress, we sometimes find ourselves reacting before\nwe have considered our options, or even considered that we might have any\noptions. Slowing down can allow us to consider possibilities and think about\nthe likelihood of success for those possibilities: Given what\u2019s at stake and\nthe resources at my disposal, what can I do in this situation? W hat would be\na good outcome here? And what is the likelihood that things will go well if I\nrespond  this way instead of  that way?\nIt\u2019s in the select stage that we clarify what our goals are and what\nresources we have at our disposal. What do I want to accomplish? How best\ncan I accomplish that goal? Do I have strengths that can help me (e.g.,\nhumor and an ability to take the edge off heated conversations), or\nweaknesses that could hur t me (e.g., a t endency to snap w hen criticized)?\nLet\u2019s say that Clara has talked to her mother and gotten some perspective.\nShe realizes that Frances really is worried about Angela, but Frances doesn\u2019t\nunderstand that the situation is different than with Frances\u2019s own kids. Clara\nrealizes she has more than one goal here: she wants to maintain a positive\nrelationship with her sister, protect her daughter from criticism, and also feel\ngood a bout her ability as a mother.\nSo now Clara thinks about what she should do; the options, and the\nlikelihood t hat each option will lead to a positive outcome. She worries that if\nshe does nothing, Frances will continue criticizing her child and blaming\nClara for not being a good enough parent. So she decides to say something.\nBut how? And when? They often rib each other, but Clara doesn\u2019t feel like\njoking when her feelings are hurt, and she knows any joke will sound passive-\naggressive and make things worse. So she decides to wait until she and\nFrances are alone, and talk to her then. In thinking about this talk, she realizes\nthat Frances might actually be a helpful sounding board for some of her\nstruggles with Angela, but she definitely does not want Frances to give\nadvice.\nClara has to choose among options at this stage. One response may not\n(and probably will not) be the end of it. No one approach by itself is likely to\nbe effective in addressing all the challenges in a complicated situation or in a\nrelationship across time. Clara may try multiple strategies with her sister in\nthe coming months. And, of course, circumstances change; her sister may have\nsome highly visible and difficult parenting challenges of her own, and this\nmight change how Clara responds to her sister.\nSelecting a strategy is highly personal. Cultural norms and our individual\nvalues play important roles here. Confronting someone directly is considered\nbad manners in some cultures, while in others it is considered mature and\nauthentic. Often, it comes down to intuition honed by experience\u2014what feels\nlike the best way to respond to this situation, in this moment.\nUsing the W.I.S.E.R. model as a guide for responding to a stressor may at\ntimes be difficult. The stressor may happen fast and there may not be time to\nslow down your response. Or the source of stress may recur and evolve over\ntime, so you may need to revisit these stages as the situation changes. The key\nis to try to slow things down where you can, zoom in, and move from a fully\nautomatic response to a more considered and purposeful response that aligns\nwith who you are and what you are seeking to accomplish.\nStage Four: Engage  (Implementing With Care)\nNow it\u2019s time to respond as skillfully as possible, to engage  the strategy\nyou\u2019ve selected. If you\u2019ve taken some time to observe and interpret the\nsituation, and if you\u2019ve made some effort to consider the possibilities and\ntheir likelihood of success, your response is more likely to succeed. But the\nproof of the pudding is in the eating. Even the most logical response can fail if\nwe do a poor job implementing that strategy. Practice\u2014either in our minds or\nrunning it by a trusted confidant\u2014can help. Chances of success also increase\nif we first reflect on what we do well and what we don\u2019t do so well. Some of\nus are funny, and we know that people respond well to our sense of humor.\nSome of us are more soft-spoken, and we know that quiet discussion in\nprivate settings is more comfortable for us.\nClara gets up the nerve to say something when she and Frances have\ncleared the dishes together and they are alone in the kitchen. She\u2019s direct, and\ncalm; her emotions are still there but they are more in the background. At first\nit goes well; Frances is apologetic for offering unsolicited advice (she\u2019s been\nthinking about her comment, too, and felt bad for how it came out). The two of\nthem agree that they both want what\u2019s best for Angela, and Clara shares some\nrecent problems, which Frances understands. Then Clara says something\nabout Angela being her own person and not being like Frances\u2019s kids (it\nsounded so good in her head!) and the situation turns quickly. Frances really\nhas been under a lot of stress at work and arguing more than usual with her\nhusband, so Clara\u2019s comment hits a raw nerve. They start to argue again, and\nthen are interrupted by their mother.\n\u201cI kind of like it when you fight,\u201d their mother says.\n\u201cLike it? Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause it reminds me of what you were like when you were younger,\nand I feel like I\u2019m 35 a gain.\u201d\nThey laugh. But soon that feeling wears off, and the two sisters leave the\nbarbecue with strong emotions and things still not fully resolved.\nStage Five: Reflect (Monday M orning Quarterbacking)\nHow did that work out? Did I make things better or worse? Have I\nlearned something new about  the challenge I\u2019m facing and about  the best\nrespons e?\nReflecting on our response to a challenge can yield dividends for the\nfuture. It\u2019s in learning from experience that we truly grow wiser. We can do\nthis not only for something that just happened, but for events both big and\nsmall that have happened in the past and linger in our memories. Take a look\nat the worksheet below and consider using it to reflect on an incident or\nsituation that\u2019s troubling you.\n \n \nWATCH\nDid I face the problem directly or try to avoid it?\nDid I take time to get an accurate assessment of the situation?\nDid I talk with the people involved?\nDid I consult with others to get their understanding of what happened?\nINTERPRET\nDid I recognize how I felt and what was at stake for me in this situation?\nWas I willing to acknowledge my role in the situation?\nHave I focused too much on what is going on in my own head and not enough on what is going on around me?\nAre there alternative ways of understanding what is going on in this situation?\nSELECT\nWas I clear about the outcome I wanted?\nDid I consider all the available options for responding?\nDid I do a good job identifying resources available to help me?\nDid I weigh the pros and cons of different strategies to achieve my goals?\nDid I choose the tools that would work best in meeting the current challenge?\nDid I reflect on IF or WHEN I should do something about the situation?\nDid I consider who else could be involved in solving the problem or meeting the challenge?\nENGAGE\nDid I practice my response or run it by a trusted confidant to increase the likelihood that it would succeed?\nDid I take steps that are realistic for me?\nDid I evaluate progress and was I willing to adjust as needed?\nWhat steps did I rush through or mess up or skip over? What did I do well?\nREFLECT\nIn light of all I\u2019ve just reflected on, how would I do things differently next time?\nWhat have I learned?\nDon\u2019t worry if this list of questions, or even the W.I.S.E.R. model in\ngeneral, seems like too much to think about at once. Many of the steps in the\nW.I.S.E.R. model may be things you already do instinctively, and 90 percent\nof everyday life doesn\u2019t require this kind of reflection. Think of the model and\nthis list of questions as a kind of coaching tool for that final 10 percent of life\nwhen you feel stuck, or you notice yourself behaving in ways that don\u2019t serve\nyou well.\nWhen it\u2019s all over, the consideration of what happened, and why, helps us\nto see things we may have missed, and helps us understand the causes and\neffects of these emotional cascades that may have escaped our notice. If we\u2019re\ngoing to learn from our experience and do better next time, we have to do\nmore than just live through it. We have to reflect. In doing so, when we find\nourselves in the heat of a similar moment next time, we may be able to take\nthat extra split second to consider the situation, clarify our goals, consider\noptions for responding to it, and move the needle of our lives in the right\ndirection.\nGETTING UNSTUCK\nThe W.I.S.E.R. model is most straightforward when it is applied to\ndiscrete relationship challenges. But stress comes in all varieties, and many\ninvolve more chronic patterns in our relationships. Sometimes we encounter\nsimilar things over and over in a relationship, the same arguments, the same\nannoyances, the same sequence of unhelpful responses. We end up feeling that\nwe are not moving forward, and we can\u2019t imagine getting out of our current\nrut. The two of us, Bob and Marc, refer to this feeling with the highly\nscientific name of stuckness.\nWe see this both in our Harvard Study participants and among people who\ncome to us seeking psychotherapy. People often feel stuck in their lives and\nmay not be able to articulate fully why they feel that way. They may find\nthemselves having the same disagreements with a partner over and over, no\nlonger able to have even a simple conversation that does not get heated. At\nwork, it might feel like a boss is frequently micromanaging and finding fault,\nleading to a sense of worthlessness that can be difficult to overcome. (In fact,\nwork relationships that fall into a rut are some of the most vexing. More on\nthat in Chapter Nine.)\nFor example, John Marsden from Chapter Two found himself deeply\nlonely in his early 80s, in part because he and his wife were locked in a\nrepetitive cycle of not giving each other what they most needed\u2014a ffection\nand support.\nQ: Do you ever go to your wife when you\u2019re upset?\nA: No. Definitely not. I would get no sympathy. I would be told that it\u2019s a sign of weakness. I mean I can\u2019t tell you\nthe negative signals I get all day it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s so destructive.\nJohn was thinking about the reality of his life\u2014about real conversations\nwith his partner. But without realizing it, he was also constructing that reality.\nHis isolation from his wife became a self-fulfilling prophecy. He saw every\nnew encounter with her as proof of his theory: She doesn\u2019t want to be close to\nme, I can\u2019t trust her with my feelings.\nAs the modern Buddhist teacher Shohaku Okumura writes, \u201cThe world we\nlive in is the world we create.\u201d\nAs in many Buddhist teachings, there is a double meaning there. Humans\nphysically create the world we live in, but at every moment we are also\ncreating a picture of the world in our minds by telling stories to ourselves\u2014\nindividually and collectively\u2014that may or may not be true.\nNo two relationships are the same, but one person will often get stuck in\nsimilar places in different relationships. The old saying, \u201cWe\u2019re always\nfighting the last battle,\u201d is very true. We tend to think that the thing that\nhappened to us before is about to happen again, whether that is the case or not.\nAt their core, feelings of stuckness come from patterns in our lives. Some\npatterns help us navigate life efficiently and quickly, but others may lead us to\nrespond in ways that don\u2019t serve us well. These patterns may include\nspending time with the wrong people\u2014the wrong friends, and even the wrong\npartners. Far from being random, these patterns often reflect areas of\npreoccupation and struggles from our past, which in a way feel like home.\nThey are like a set of familiar dance steps that we fall into. A familiar\nsensation, even if it\u2019s negative, is activated in a conversation with someone,\nand there is a kind of comfort in that familiarity. Oh here it is again, I know\nthis danc e.\nMost of us feel a certain amount of stuckness to some degree, so the\nquestion is really about the strength of that feeling. Is it consistently\ndiminishing your quality of life? Is it pervasive, shaping many or most areas\nof your daily experience?\nBob was stuck in a pattern himself earlier in his life. He dated a series of\nwomen, and his friends were consistently surprised at the partners he was\nchoosing. The relationships kept souring. Feeling stuck, he went into\npsychotherapy, and in describing each of these failed relationships to his\ntherapist, he saw that these failures weren\u2019t coincidences or a string of bad\nluck. His therapist helped him realize that he\u2019d been choosing the same type of\nperson over and over again\u2014a type of person with whom he was not\ncompatible. Getting honest perspectives on your life from people you trust can\nbe very illuminating in your effort to become unstuck. Such trusted observers\nwill almost certainly see things that you can\u2019t.\nYou may also be able to do something like this yourself by asking, If\nsomeone else was telling me this story, what would I think? What would I\ntell them? This kind of self-distanced reflection can shed new light on old\nstories.\nRealizing that you may not be seeing the whole picture is a big first step in\nbreaking free of mental patterns that lock us in. The Zen master Shunryu\nSuzuki taught that it is a positive thing to approach some situations in life as if\nyou\u2019ve never lived them before. \u201cIn the beginner\u2019s mind there are many\npossibilities,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut in the expert\u2019s mind there are few.\u201d We all feel\nlike experts when it comes to our own lives, and the challenge is to stay open\nto the possibility that there is more we can learn about ourselves\u2014to allow\nourselves to be beginners.\nRELATIONSHIPS, ADAPTATION, AND THE END\nOF THE WORLD\nWhen the Covid-19 pandemic struck the world in 2020, the social\nisolation, financial strain, and constant worry was an enormous shock to\nsocieties all over the globe. As the pandemic and lockdowns continued,\nisolation and anxiety around the world surged. Stress levels went through the\nroof. It was, by many measures, a challenge on a scale that the world had not\nexperienced since World War II.\nWhen the pandemic began, we went back to our Study records to read\nonce more what our original Study members told us about how they got\nthrough big life crises. They had grown up in the Great Depression, and most\nof the college men had served in World War II. What most of them recalled\nwas that in order to survive these great crises, they leaned on their most\nimportant relationships. The men who fought in the war talked about the bonds\nthey formed with their fellow soldiers and how important those bonds were,\nnot just for their safety but also for their sanity. After the war, many talked\nabout how important it was to be able to share at least part of their\nexperiences with their wives. In fact, those who did so were more likely to\nstay married. The support they got from others during those hard times, and\nlater in processing them, was crucial. And we find that today.\nThe pandemic froze our lives, locked us in with those we live with, kept\nus apart from the friends and coworkers we were accustomed to seeing every\nday. We never signed up to be with our spouses and children 24/7, but we had\nto make do. Many older adults never dreamed that they\u2019d be separated from\ntheir precious grandchildren for more than an entire year.\nFlexibility became more important than ever. To survive we had to give\neach other space, cut each other slack. If we needed distance from a spouse, it\nmay not have been because there was something wrong with the relationship\nbut because these were abnormal times.\nSadly, Covid-19 won\u2019t be the last global catastrophe, or the last\npandemic. These things will continue to come\u2026 and go. That\u2019s the nature of\nlife.\nThe Harvard Study teaches us that it\u2019s crucial to lean on those\nrelationships that can hold us up when things go sideways, just as the Study\nfamilies did during the Great Depression, World War II, and the Great\nRecession in 2008. Through the Covid-19 pandemic, that meant staying in\ntouch, in a purposeful way, with people who were now suddenly distant from\nus. Sending that text, setting up a video chat, making a phone call. Not just\nthinking of a distant friend but reaching out. It meant being patient with the\npeople we love and asking for help when we needed it. The same will be true\nfor the next crisis, and the next.\nFor Marc, the idea that relationships help us navigate major challenges is\nquite personal.\nIn December of 1939, at the same time that Arlie Bock was interviewing\nHarvard College sophomores in his mission to figure out what makes people\nhealthy, Marc\u2019s father, Robert Schulz, then 10 years old, was on a passenger\nship with his older sister, crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Born to a Jewish\nfamily in Hamburg, they\u2019d fled Nazi Germany, and arrived in the United States\nwith only the clothes on their backs, two small suitcases, and no clear plan.\nBut they were alive. And for one major reason: Marc\u2019s grandmother\u2019s\nnatural habit of forming deep connections with people.\nMarc\u2019s father remembers an idyllic early life as a child in Hamburg. Even\nas his family navigated his father\u2019s death at a young age, he was surrounded\nby family and friends. Life was good. His family\u2019s textile business was\nthriving, and he was into gymnastics and playing the piano. Marc heard him\ntalk often about the beauty of Hamburg, the lake at the center of the city, and\nespecially marzipan, a sweet, almond-flavored German treat, a staple of his\nearly childhood.\nHe had a charmed life back then, he always said.\nBut things began to change as the Nazis consolidated power and began\ntheir campaigns against Jews. Etched in his memory was a particularly scary\nday and night in November of 1938 when he was nine years old. During the\nevening of terror that would come to be known as Kristallnacht, or \u201cCrystal\nNight,\u201d many Jewish homes, businesses, and synagogues in his neighborhood\nwere destroyed or burned to the ground. The next day, the Gestapo came to his\nschool and rounded up many of the Jewish teachers and students.\nAs deportations and detentions of Jews were being conducted all over the\ncity, Marc\u2019s grandmother reached out to close friends of hers, a German\nfamily that ran a dairy down the street. They agreed to hide Marc\u2019s father and\nhis family in the basement of the dairy. Without the combination of this\nkindness and a great deal of luck, they would not have survived.\nEven to this day, Marc stays in touch with the descendants of that family in\nGermany, who tell the same story but from the perspective of their parents and\ngrandparents, who\u2019d made a decision in the moment to protect their friends at\ngrave risk to themselves. It was an act of kindness that could have cost them\ntheir lives. Without them, Marc would not exist.\nACCEPTING THE BIG RISK\nThe question for us in our daily lives is: When we confront personal or\nglobal challenges, when people hurt us, or when we find that we have hurt\nothers\u2026 w hat do w e do?\nHuman beings are mysterious, wonderful, dangerous creatures. We are at\nonce vulnerable and incredibly resilient. We have the capacity for creating\nboth magnificent beauty and vast destruction.\nThat\u2019s the big picture. But if we zoom in a little bit and focus on the life of\na single person\u2026 your life, let\u2019s say\u2026 and even the small events and stresses\nin your life, the complexity of who we are remains.\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you struggle, at least sometimes, to understand\nthe people in your life\u2014from those you love most to those you barely know.\nIt\u2019s difficult to really connect with other people and know them. It\u2019s difficult\nto love and to be loved. It\u2019s difficult to keep from pushing love away.\nBut making the effort can bring joy, novelty, safety\u2014and sometimes it can\neven be lifesaving. Slowing down, attempting to see difficult situations\nclearly, and cultivating positive relationships can help us manage the waves,\nwhether they come from a political crisis, a strange virus that travels around\nthe globe, a moment of reckoning about who we really are, or a rush of anger\nat a family barbecue. Our initial, automatic responses are not the only ways\nwe can respond. Recognizing this can allow us to pause in the midst of\nchallenge, in the midst of our own bad luck, our own repeating problems,\neven our own mistakes, and chart a path forward.\nIn the coming chapters, we will talk about applying the ideas we\u2019ve\ndiscussed so far to particular kinds of relationships. Every type of\nrelationship is a little bit different; family relationships are different from\nwork relationships, which are different from marriages, which are different\nfrom friendships. Of course, sometimes these categories overlap. Our family\nmembers might also be our coworkers, and our siblings might also be our best\nfriends. Still, broad categories can be helpful to consider, while still\nremembering that each relationship is unique and requires its own kind of\nattention and adaptation. In the next chapter, we\u2019ll start close to the heart, with\nthe person beside you.\n  7  \nTHE PERSON BESIDE YOU\nHow Intimate Relationships Shape Our Lives\nWhen we were children, we used to think that when we were\ngrown-up we would no longer be vulnerable. But to grow up is to accept\nvulnerability.\u2026 T o be alive is to be vulnerable.\nMadeleine L\u2019Engle\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1979\nIn Plato\u2019s Symposium, Aristophanes gives a speech about the origin of\nhuman beings. In the beginning, he says, every human had four legs, four arms,\nand two heads. They were strong and ambitious creatures. Zeus, in order to\ndiminish their fearsome powers, split them all down the middle. Now,\nwalking on only two legs, every human is in search of their other half.\n\u201c\u200a\u2018Love,\u2019\u200a\u201d Plato says, \u201cis the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our\ndesire to be complete.\u201d\nAfter thousands of years, this idea still resonates.\n\u201cJean is my better half,\u201d Dill Carson, one of the inner-city Boston\nparticipants, told the Harvard Study when asked about his wife. \u201cEvery\nevening we sit down and have a glass of wine. It\u2019s a kind of ritual, I don\u2019t feel\nthe day is complete without it. We talk about the things we\u2019re feeling and\nwhat\u2019s going on. If we had an argument, we\u2019ll talk about that. We talk about\nplans, about the kids. It kind of rounds out the day, smooths over the rough\nedges. If I had to do it all over again, I\u2019d marry the same woman, without a\ndoubt.\u201d\nMy better half\u2026 It\u2019s a sentiment that a number of Harvard Study\nparticipants expressed when asked about their partners. The deepest and most\npositive intimate connections often gave participants a feeling, as Plato was\nsuggesting, of balance and unity.\nUnfortunately, there is no universal formula for happy partnerships, happy\nromances, happy marriages, no single magical key that can unlock the joys of\nintimate companionship for everyone. The way two \u201chalves\u201d might fit together\nvaries from culture to culture, and of course from one particular relationship\nto the next. Even from one era to another, or one generation to another, the\nforms of relationships change. Most of the original participants in the Harvard\nStudy, for example, were married at some point in their life, partly because\nthis was the most acceptable expression of commitment at the time. Today, the\nvariety of committed relationships is increasing, and formal marriage is\nbecoming less common. In the United States in 2020, 51 percent of all\nhouseholds did not consist of any married couples. In 1950, the number was\ncloser to 20 percent. But a change in form doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a change\nin feeling; human beings remain much the same. Even within the range of\nseemingly \u201ctraditional\u201d marriages there can be a lot of variation. Love comes\nin all shapes and sizes.\nTake James Brewer, one of the Study\u2019s college participants. He came from\na small town in Indiana, and when he first arrived at Harvard he was an\nintelligent but still naive young man with little life experience. He told the\nStudy he could not understand the idea of \u201cheterosexuality.\u201d To him it made no\nsense that anyone should be restricted to having sex with only one gender\u2014as\nfar as he was concerned, beauty was beauty, and love was love. He was\nattracted to both men and women; shouldn\u2019t everybody  feel that way? He was\nopen about this idea with his friends and fellow students until he began to\nencounter resistance, and then significant prejudice, at which point he began\nto hide his sexuality. Soon after college, he married Maryanne, whom he\ndeeply loved and who loved him, and they had kids and lived a full life\ntogether. But in 1978, after thirty-one years of marriage, Maryanne died of\nbreast cancer, at the age of 57.\nWhen the Study asked James why he thought their marriage had lasted so\nlong, he wrote,\nWe survived because we shared so very much. She read important\nparts of good book s to me. We talked of castles and kings, of cabbages,\nand many other things. We looked and compared notes on what we saw.\n\u2026 We enjoyed eating together, seeing places together, sleeping together.\n\u2026 Our parties, our best parties, were spontaneous ones that we created\nfor just the two of us, often as surprises for each other.\nThree years after Maryanne\u2019s death, a Harvard Study interviewer visited\nJames in his home. During the visit James asked the interviewer to follow him\nas he went into a brightly lit room chattering with birds. Beside the windows\nwere a few cages, and in the middle of the room, several rope lattices and\nartificial trees. The birds alighted on him as he opened their cages and fed\nthem. They were his wife\u2019s birds, he told the interviewer, still so grief-\nstricken that he couldn\u2019t manage to say her name. Asked about his current love\nlife, he said that he\u2019d had some short-lived relationships, that many people\nthought of him as gay, and while he wasn\u2019t currently in a relationship, he\nhadn\u2019t given up on the possibility. \u201cI suppos e eventually someone will come\nalong and touch my heart,\u201d he said.\nAs anyone who has loved another person knows, the pursuit of intimate\nconnection is not without hazards: by opening ourselves to the joy of loving\nand being loved, we risk being hurt. The closer we feel to another person, the\nmore vulnerable we become. Yet we continue to take that risk.\nThis chapter wades into the deep end of intimacy and the effect intimate\nconnection has on well-being. We encourage you to see everything we offer in\nthe coming pages through the lens of your own personal experiences, and to\ntry to uncover some of the reasons behind both the successes and the\nchallenges you\u2019ve had in intimate relationships. As the lives of our Harvard\nStudy participants show, recognizing and understanding your emotions, and\nhow those emotions affect your intimate partner\u2014the person beside you\u2014can\nhave both subtle and sweeping impacts on your life.\nINTIMACY, AND ALLOWING OURSELVES TO\nBE KNOWN\nWe asked Study participants and their partners a set of questions about\nintimacy again and again over many decades. This allowed us to see each\nunique trajectory of feeling\u2014affection, tension, and love\u2014from a\nrelationship\u2019s beginnings to its very end. These relationships ran the gamut\nfrom brief and fiery to long and sleepy, and everything in between. Let\u2019s look\nat one of those that\u2019s in between:\nJoseph Cichy and his wife, Olivia, married in 1948 and remained married\nuntil Olivia passed away in 2007 just after their fifty-ninth wedding\nanniversary. Their marriage is representative of a strong partnership, and the\nways that two people can support each other over the duration of a life. But\ntheir partnership is representative for another reason, too: it was far from\nperfect.\nOver the years, whenever the Study checked in with Joseph, he reported\nthat he felt good about his life. He had a career he liked, three wonderful kids,\nand a \u201cpeaceful\u201d relationship with his wife. In 2008, we asked their daughter,\nLily, to reflect on her childhood and she told the Study that her parents were\nabout as calm as a married couple could be. She couldn\u2019t remember them\nhaving a single argument.\nJoseph had given a similar account to the Study across many years. \u201cI am\nas easy to get along with as anyone who ever lived,\u201d he triumphantly told the\nStudy in 1967 when he was 46 years old. He loved his wife, Olivia, just as\nshe was, he said; there was nothing he would change about her. He gave his\nchildren the same respect he would give to anyone, offering guidance when\nthey asked for it, but not trying to control them. In his work as a businessman,\nhe did his best to listen to the perspectives of others before offering his own\nview of a situation. \u201cThe only form of persuasion that works is to empathize,\u201d\nhe said.\nIt was a philosophy that served Joseph well his entire life. He enjoyed\nlistening to people and learning about their experiences. We\u2019ve been making\nthe case that understanding how others feel and think is beneficial to us in our\nrelationships, and Joseph is a great example of this. But for everyone who\nwas close to Joseph, this interest in people and ability to listen coexisted with\na problem: he was afraid of opening himself to others, even the people he\nloved.\nAnd this included his wife, Olivia.\n\u201cThe greatest stress in our marriage isn\u2019t conflict,\u201d Joseph told the Study.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia\u2019s frustration about my unwillingness to let her get inside me. She\nfeels shut out.\u201d She was honest with him about how much this concerned her,\nand Joseph was well aware of her concern, telling the Study on several\noccasions that Olivia often told him how difficult he was to truly know. \u201cI\u2019m\nself-sufficient,\u201d he said. \u201cMy biggest weakness is not leaning on anybody . I\u2019m\njust made that way.\u201d\nJoseph was tuned in enough to other people that he could see and\narticulate their difficulty with him, but he could never get past a core, deeply\nrooted fear that is not uncommon: he didn\u2019t want to be a burden, or to feel\nanything but fully independent. Though he attended Harvard, Joseph came\nfrom humble beginnings, and told the Study that he learned the value of self-\nsufficiency as a child on his family farm, where he spent days on end\noperating a horse-drawn plow alone. His mother and father were busy with\ntheir own work on the farm, and Joseph was expected to take care of himself.\nAs an adult he believed he should handle any problems he encountered\u2014\nemotional or otherwise\u2014on  his own. He didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\nIn 2008, his daughter Lily, who was in her 50s, told a Study interviewer\nthat she still lamented this philosophy. Her father was always there for\npractical support when she needed him, and she felt she could count on him at\nany time of the day or night (and in fact, she did count on him; he helped her\nthrough a difficult marriage and some of the most trying times of her life). But\nshe never felt that she fully knew him.\nAt the age of 72, when asked about his relationship to his wife, Joseph\ntold the Study that the marriage was stable, but that there was also a sense of\ndisconnection between them. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing pulling us apart,\u201d he said, \u201cbut\nwe\u2019re not bound together.\u201d\nJoseph had decided as a young man that in his relationships, two things\nwere more important than anything else: keeping the peace, and being self-\nsufficient. It was important to him that his life and his family\u2019s life be stable\nabove  all else. This wasn\u2019t necessarily wrong; his life, by most measures,\nwas a good one. He loved his family, and they were all very loyal to each\nother. Joseph was conducting his life in the way that felt safe, and to the extent\nhis approach prevented strife, it worked for him. It\u2019s not bad to have a\nmarriage where there\u2019s little disagreement. But are there costs to always\nkeeping the peace? By being so protective of his inner experience, and so\nselective about what he shared\u2014by not being daring enough to open himself\nup\u2014w as Joseph denying both himself and Olivia the full benefits of an\nintimate connection?\nMany of us have someone like this in our lives; we should remember it\u2019s\nnot necessarily a sign that they don\u2019t care. But Olivia, at least, felt a sense of\nincompleteness, because the keystone of intimacy is the feeling of knowing\nsomeone and of being known. In fact, the word intimacy comes from the Latin\nintimare: to make known. Intimate knowledge of another person is a feature of\nromantic love, but it\u2019s also more than that. It\u2019s a quintessential piece of the\nhuman experience, and it begins long before our first kiss, long before we\nconsider marriage, in the very earliest days of life.\nINTIMATE ATTACHMENT: THE STRANGE\nSITUATION\nFrom the moment we are born we begin seeking close connections, both\nphysical and emotional, to other people. We begin life as helpless creatures,\ndependent on others for our very survival. Almost everything we encounter as\ninfants is intensely novel and potentially threatening, so it\u2019s essential that we\nestablish a strong connection to at least one other person from the very first\ndays of life. Being close to our mothers or fathers or grandparents or aunties\nis comforting and provides a refuge from danger. As we grow, we can explore\nthe world beyond our comfort zone knowing that we have a safe place to go if\nthings get scary. The simplicity and clarity of the young child\u2019s situation\nprovides a great oppor tunity to observe the fundamentals of human emotional\nconnection. This period of life vividly displays some core truths about close\nemotional bonds that are relevant for adults as well as children.\nIn the 1970s , Mary Ainsworth, a psychologist, designed a laboratory\nprocedure to help reveal how babies respond to the world around them and\nthe people on whom they are most dependent. It\u2019s known as the \u201cStrange\nSituation,\u201d and it has proved so useful over the decades that it\u2019s still\nemployed in research today, more than fifty years later. The key elements of it\nwork like this:\nA baby, usually between 9 and 18 months old, accompanied by her\nprimary caregiver, is introduced to a room with some toys in it. After\nspending a short time in the room interacting with the caregiver and playing\nwith the toys, a stranger enters. At first the stranger minds her own business,\nlets the child get used to her presence, and then tries to connect with the baby.\nA short time later, the caregiver leaves the room.\nNow the baby finds herself in a strange place, with a strange person, and\nno one with whom she feels close. Often the baby will immediately show\nsigns of discomfort and begin to cry.\nA short time later, the caregiver returns.\nWhat happens next is a key reason for the experiment. The child has\nencountered a strange situation, experienced some stress, and now her\ncaregiver has returned. The researchers have deliberately disrupted the\ninfant\u2019s sense of safety and connection\u2014albeit briefly\u2014and the child needs to\nreestablish these. How will she respond? The way the infant attempts to stay\nconnected to the person on whom she depends for survival\u2014her attachment\nstyle\u2014is believed to reveal how the child views her caregiver and also\nherself.\nA SECURE BASE\nEach of us has a particular way of staying connected to a person we need.\nAttachment styles are relevant not just to understanding early childhood, but\nalso to understanding how we manage relationships throughout our lives.\nIt is normal for children to get upset when a caregiver leaves, and in fact\nthis is what the healthy, well-adjusted child does. When the caregiver returns,\nthe child will immediately seek contact, and upon receiving it, calm down and\nreturn to a state of equilibrium. The child seeks contact during this \u201creunion\u201d\nbecause she views her caregiver as a source of love and safety and also feels\ndeserving of that love. A child who displays this sort of attachment behavior\nis considered securely attached.\nBut infants who feel less securely attached cope with that insecurity in\ntwo different ways: by expressing anxiety or avoidance. More anxious infants\nwill seek immediate contact when the caregiver returns to them, but have\ntrouble being soothed. Avoidant children, on the other hand, may appear on\nthe surface to be unconcerned about the caregiver\u2019s presence. They may show\nlittle outward distress when the caregiver leaves the room, and may not seek\ncomfort when the caregiver returns. They sometimes even turn away from the\ncaregiver during the reunion. Parents may take this to mean that the child\ndoesn\u2019t care. But appearances in such cases can be deceiving. Attachment\nresearchers theorize that these avoidant children do care when the caregiver\nleaves, but they have learned not to make too many demands on their\ncaregiver. They do this, according to the theory, because they\u2019ve sensed that\nexpressing their needs may not result in receiving love, and may also drive the\ncaregiver away.\nIn real life, children encounter variations on the Strange Situation\nrepeatedly\u2014when they\u2019re droppe d off at daycare and then picked up at the\nend of the day, for example\u2014and each of these encounters shapes their\nexpectations about future relationships. They develop a sense of how likely it\nis that others will be helpful, and also a judgment about how deserving they\nare of support.\nAdult life is, in some fundamental ways, a real-world, highly complex\nversion of the Strange Situation. Like every child who has been separated\nfrom their parent, each of us longs for a sense of security, or what\npsychologists call a secure base of attachment. A child may feel threatened\nbecause her mother is not in the room, and an adult may feel threatened by a\nfrightening health diagnosis; both benefit from a sense that someone is there\nfor them.\nBut attachment security exists on a spectrum for adults as well, and many\nof us are not fully secure in our attachments. Some of us may cling to others\nduring times of stress yet have difficulty finding the comfort we seek, while\nothers, like Joseph Cichy, may avoid closeness because we fear, deep down,\nthat if we become a burden to others, we will drive them away. Or we may\nnot be convinced that we are fully lovable. And yet we still need connection.\nLife becomes more complex as we age, but the benefits that come from\nhaving secure conne ctions continue through e very phas e of life.\nHenry and Rosa Keane, from Chapter One, are a shining example of two\npeople with secure connections. Every time they faced a difficulty together\u2014\nfrom one of their children contracting polio, to Henry being laid off, to the\ntask of facing their own mortality\u2014they were able to turn to each other for\nsupport, comfort, and courage.\nThe sequence for both babies and adults is often similar: a stress or\ndifficulty disturbs our sense of security, and we seek to restore that sense. If\nwe\u2019re lucky we are able to do this by gaining comfort from those who are\nclose to us, and we return to equilibrium.\nIn our last interview with them, sitting at their kitchen table, Henry and\nRosa kept physically reaching out for each other, especially when answering\ndifficult questions about future health challenges and their own mortality.\nThrough most of the interview, they were holding hands.\nThat simplest of gestures\u2014holding a partner\u2019s hand\u2014is a helpful portal\ninto the world of adult intimate attachment. In the Strange Situation, when a\nsecurely attached child seeks her caregiver and is comforted by a hug, there\nare physiological and psychological benefits. Her body  and her emotions are\ncalmed. Is the same true for adults? What\u2019s happening exactly when someone\nholds our hand?\nLOVING CONTACT: THE EQUIVALENT OF A\nDRUG\nJames Coan ventured into the world of attachment research by accident.\nHe had wanted to know what was happening in the brains of people suffering\nfrom post-traumatic stress disorder (a mental health condition characterized\nby flashbacks, nightmares, and worries about a traumatic event), and he was\nscanning their brains for clues. With a better understanding of their brain\nactivity, he hoped, new treatments could be devised and their suffering could\nbe eased. One of his study participants happened to be a Vietnam War veteran\nwith intense combat experience who refused to participate in the research\nwithout his wife in the room. Coan was eager for his participation and was\nhappy to make accommodations that allowed the study to continue, so the\nman\u2019s wife sat beside him while he lay in the fMRI (brain scanning) machine.\nMRI machines can be loud, and when the test began the man became\nagitated and didn\u2019t want to continue. His wife, sitting beside him, sensed his\nagitation and instinctively took his hand in hers. This had a calming effect on\nhim, and he was able to go on.\nCoan was intrigued by this effect, and when the study was over, he\ndeveloped a new brain imaging study to see if he could find some neural\nevidence for what had happened.\nParticipants in the new experiment were put into the fMRI machine and\nshown one of two slides. A red slide meant there was a 20 percent chance\nthey would receive a small electrical shock. A blue slide meant they would\nnot receive a shock.\nThe participants were divided into three groups: the first group had no one\nin the room with them during the experiment. The second group held the hand\nof a complete stranger. The third group held the hand of a spouse.\nThe results were crystal-clear: holding hands with someone they felt close\nto calmed the activity in the fear centers of participants\u2019 brains, and\ndiminished their anxiety. But perhaps most remarkable, holding hands with\nsomeone they felt close to actually diminished the amount of pain participants\nsaid they felt when they received a shock. There was also a benefit to holding\nthe hand of a stranger, but the effect was so pronounced for intimate partners\n(particularly those in more satisfied relationships) that it led Coan to conclude\nthat holding a loved one\u2019s hand during a medical procedure had the same\neffect as a mild anesthetic. Study participants\u2019 relationships were affecting\ntheir bodi es in real time.\nMORE THAN A FEELING\nRelationships live inside of us. The mere thought of a person who is\nimportant to us can generate hormones and other chemicals that travel through\nour blood and affect our hearts, our brains, and numerous other body systems.\nThese effects can span a lifetime. As we noted in Chapter One, using data\nfrom the Harvard Study, George Vaillant found that marital happiness at age\n50 was a better predictor of good physical health in late life than age 50\ncholesterol level.\nCoan was able to analyze the effect of intimate connection on a person\u2019s\nbrain in the lab, but we obviously can\u2019t (yet) put ourselves into an fMRI\nmachine while we\u2019re on a first date, or when we\u2019re having an argument with a\npartner in a parking lot. Luckily, at the very root of all intimate attachment,\nregardless of our age, there is a different kind of diagnostic tool that each of\nus can access just by paying attention:\nEmotion.\nIn any situation in life, emotions are a signal that there are matters of\nsignificance to us at play, and they are especially revealing when it comes to\nintimate relationships. If we take some time to pause and examine that\nseemingly simple thing, how we feel, we can develop an invaluable life tool:\nthe ability to look beneath the surface of our relationships. Our emotions can\npoint us to hidden truths about our wishes and fears, our expectations about\nhow others should behave, and the reasons we view our partners the way we\ndo.\nImagine it this way: when scuba divers descend into a body  of water, they\nhave depth indicators on their wrists. But they can also feel the depth in their\nbodies. The deeper they go, the more pressure they feel.\nEmotions are a kind of depth indicator for a relationship. Most of the time\nwe are swimming near the surface of life, interacting with our partners and\ngoing about the daily business of living. The underlying emotional currents are\nburied a bit deeper, in the dark of the water. When we experience a strong\nemotion, positive or negative\u2014a sudden welling-up of gratitude, or a surge of\nanger at being misunderstood\u2014i t\u2019s an indication of something deeper. If we\nmake an effort to pause in these moments, to watch and interpret, as we\u2019ve\nsuggested in our W.I.S.E.R. model of interaction (Chapter Six), we can begin\nto see more clearly the things that are important to us, and also what\u2019s\nimportant to our partners.\nNURTURING A BEDROCK OF EMPATHY AND\nAFFECTION\nHow important are the emotions that we feel (and express) during\ninteractions with our partners? Can emotions indicate the strength of\nconnection, and the likelihood of  a lasting partnership?\nWe investigated the link between emotion and relationship stability in one\nof our earliest joint research studies. We brought couples who were married\nor living together into the lab and videotaped them for eight to ten minutes as\nthey discussed a recent upsetting incident in their relationship. Later the\nvideos were rated for how much each partner expressed specific emotions\n(for example, affection, anger, humor) and behaviors (for example,\n\u201cacknowledges partner\u2019s perspective\u201d).\nWe specifically asked research assistants who did not have extensive\ntraining in psychology to rate the emotions in these videos. Would these\nuntrained observers\u2019 natural human ability to recognize how others are feeling\nbe useful in predicting stability in relationships?\nFive years later, we checked back with the couples to see how they were\ndoing. Some were still together, some were not. When we set their\nrelationship status beside our research assistants\u2019 ratings of emotions in their\nearlier interactions, we found that the ratings predicted with close to 85\npercent accuracy which couples had stayed together. This is consistent with\nmany other studies showing that emotions between partners are a critical\nindicator of whether intimate relationships thrive or fail. The fact that raters\nwith no special knowledge of psychology could accurately predict\nrelationship strength was significant because it showed that most adults have a\nfacility to accurately read emotions. Most of the raters had not yet\nexperienced deep, longer-term relationships, yet when they looked closely,\nthey could sense important, sometimes subtle emotions and behaviors in the\ncouples. Emotions drive relationships, and not icing them matters.\nNot every type of emotion is equally predictive of the health of a\nrelationship, however. Some are particularly important, and in our study, two\ncategories of emotion stood ou t:\nEmpathy and affection.\nThe men and women who expressed more affectionate emotions while\nthey were discussing something upsetting with their partner were more likely\nto be together five years later. Empathic responses from the men were also\nimportant. The more that men were tuned in to their partner\u2019s feelings, the\nmore they showed interest in understanding their partner, and the more they\nacknowledged their partner\u2019s perspective, the more likely the couple was to\nstay together. These findings, along with our findings about the importance of\nempathic effort (discussed in Chapter 5), point to an important idea about\nintimate relationships: if a couple can cultivate a bedrock of affection and\nempathy (meaning curiosity and the willingne ss to listen), their bond will\nbe more stable and e ndur ing.\nA FEAR OF DIFFERENCES\nAll kinds of things can cause strong, challenging emotions in intimate\nrelationships. Even positive emotions can be challenging. A great love,\nbecause of its importance to us, can become plagued by a great fear of loss.\nBut one of the most common reasons for strong emotions in a relationship\nis simple differences between partners. Where there is difference, there may\nbe disagreement, and where there is disagreement there is often emotion.\nWhen differences first arise, they can be alarming. After the initial\nexcitement and euphoria of a new relationship begins to wane, you might start\nto notice things about your partner that worry you. Sometimes it might be Big-\nD Differences (like whether or not to have kids) that warrant consideration of\nwhether the relationship is right for both of you. But often it\u2019s little-d\ndifferences that seem big because of the adjustments they require. Maybe one\nof you likes to joke around in times of stress and the other finds nothing funny\nabout hard times. Or one of you loves to explore new restaurants and the other\nprefers to cook at home.\nWhen you begin to discover these differences, it\u2019s easy to feel threatened.\nIf you\u2019re married or living together, you might feel as though the specific life\nyou\u2019ve always imagined is under threat, but you\u2019ve come too far to turn back.\nYou might feel trapped, and begin to have thoughts like, My partner is:\nSelfish\nIgnor ant\nImmoral\nDamaged\n\u2026 and the differences can come to look like problems that are hardwired\nby background or family. This can seem to be evidence of how incompatible\nthe two of you are.\nPsychologist Dan Wile wrote in his book  After the Honeymoon:\nAfter the honeymoon. The very words carry a burden of sadness, as\nif for a short while we lived in a golden trance of love, and now we\u2019ve\nbeen jolted awake. The fog of early infatuation has lifted and we see our\npartners for who they are.\u2026 Immediately comes the thought, \u201cOh no! Is\nthis the person I\u2019m suppos ed to spend the rest of my life with?\u201d\nConfronted with these emotions, we often (and understandably) think the\ngoal should be to avoid or reduce differences. Joseph Cichy was a master at\nminimizing difficulties. He lived his entire life doing his best to avoid conflict\nand smooth over any cracks. And in terms of diminishing conflict, it worked.\nBut the result was a marriage with less emotional closeness, less intimacy.\nSo the question becomes, if a smooth relationship with no conflict is not\nthe path to rich and fulfilling intimacy, but conflict often causes stress, what\ndo w e do?\nTHE DANCE\nEarly in their marriage, Bob and his wife, Jennifer, used their weekly date\nnight to go to a ballroom dancing class. Most of the other couples were\nengaged and taking the class to help them on their wedding day. During one\nclass Jennifer, who is a psychologist, wondered: Could each couple\u2019s way of\ndancing together be a window into what their relationship was like? As with\nnew challenges in relationships, new dance moves are sometimes awkward at\nfirst, and it takes couples time to learn the steps and to adjust to and\naccommodate each other. One partner is usually a faster \u201cstepper\u201d or more of\na natural than the other, but both make mistakes, both are learning. Could their\ndancing indicate which couples were capable of tolerating and forgiving\nmistakes? Could their style of resolving problems in the dance predict\nwhether they\u2019d still be together in five years?\nJust as with dancing, the old adage that you have to learn by doing is\nespecially apt when it comes to relationships. There is give-and-take, flow\nand counterflow. There are routines, steps, and improvisations. Most\nimportantly, there are mistakes and missteps. No couple is going to be Fred\nAstaire and Ginger Rogers the first time they take the floor together. (Even\nFred and Ginger needed a lot of practice!) Both partners must learn as they\ngo. These missteps are not failures or signs that dancing together is\nimpossible. Instead, they are oppor tunities to learn; step here instead of there.\nMy partner wants to go this way\u2014I\u2019ll go with him. Now I would like to go\nthat way\u2014he\u2019ll have to learn to come with me. Yes, we notice the mistakes\nand those moments when we are not in sync. But the important thing is how\nboth dance partners respond.\nThe same is true in life. In the end, what matters most are not the\nchallenges we face in relationships, but how  we manage  them.\nUNDERVALUED OPPORTUNITIES\nOne thing both of us, Marc and Bob, know from decades of doing couples\ntherapy is that people in intimate relationships often overlook the\noppor tunities presented by disagreements.\nIt happens all the time: a couple shows up for their first session, and one\npartner has a very clear idea of why they are there. It often involves pointing a\nfinger at the other person:\nHe has trouble letting things go.\nShe needs to work on he r ange r issues.\nHe doesn\u2019t do hi s share around t he hous e.\nShe never wants to go out , but I don\u2019 t like sitting ar ound.\nHe\u2019s obsessed with sex (or he\u2019s not interested in sex).\nWhatever the \u201cproblem\u201d is, the implication is clear: my partner needs to\nbe fixed. But in reality, there\u2019s almost always a deeper, more complex tension\nwithin the relationship that the couple has not acknowledged. Discovering that\ntension usually requires both self-reflection and conversation.\nIn couples therapy, we assume that there will be disagreements and\ndifferences, and we encourage couples to recognize and attempt to understand\nthem. Disagreements, and the emotions that come with them, are\noppor tunities to revitalize a relationship by revealing those important\ntruths hidden below the surface.\nTwo lives, in all of their complexity, are bound to include differences that\ndon\u2019t quite fit together. Maybe you feel the need to keep things clean and a\npile of dirty dishes causes a flash of frustration, or your partner gets angry at\nyou about your attention to your smartphone, or maybe one of you is often\nrunning late and that causes arguments.\n\u201cYou never put the cap back on the toothpaste tube!\u201d one partner might\ncomplain, with an emotional weight that doesn\u2019t seem to match the\ncircumstances.\nThe intense feelings that emerge in recurring arguments, however trivial,\noften come down to one of a few common, but profound concerns. See if any\nof these ring a bell:\nYou don\u2019 t care about  me.\nI\u2019m working har der at this than y ou ar e.\nI\u2019m not sure I can trust you.\nI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose you.\nYou don\u2019 t think I\u2019m good e nough.\nYou don\u2019 t accept me for who I am.\nSifting through the emotions of a disagreement to uncover these fears and\nworries and feelings of vulnerability\u2014bot h our partner\u2019s and our own\u2014isn\u2019t\nalways easy. First we have to allow for the possibility that we are missing\nwhat\u2019s really going on beneath the surface. Because we have an instinct to\nprotect ourselves, we have a tendency to jump to conclusions without\nrealizing that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Just as we flinch or throw up our hands\nwhen a physical object is hurled at us, we tend to flinch and pass judgment\nwhen a heavy emotion comes our way.\nThe cap on the toothpas te tube would never bother me\u2014why does it\nhave to bot her you? Y ou\u2019re too sensitive!\nAnd just like that, rather than investigating the disagreement and the\nemotions that come with it, we\u2019ve taken a hard stance, passed judgment, and\ndecided that the problem is our partner\u2019s oversensitivity. This kind of\njudgment happens instantly in all kinds of situations, from \u201ctrivial\u201d\ndisagreements to the biggest issues of love and connection.\nJoseph Cichy, for example, couldn\u2019t see the full extent of his wife\u2019s\nexperience because he was too immersed in his own interpretation. He\nunderstood that his resistance to being open bothered her, but he\u2019d already\ndecided that his understanding was the right one. In his mind, he was saving\nher the trouble of hearing about his personal feelings. Sharing his emotions, he\nthought, would endanger his peaceful relationship with his wife, and he didn\u2019t\nwant to lose her. But in an effort to protect against that vulnerability, he was\ncontributing to the vulnerability that his wife felt. After all, the person she was\nclosest to in the world did not seem to need her as much as she needed him.\nHe never asked the question, What would it mean for our relationship if I\nshared more of my feelings?\nWe all have our own vulnerabilities, those fears and worries that cause us\nto react to disagreements by turning away from them to protect ourselves.\nThese emotions are not easy to face, but the disagreements we have with our\npartners have the potential to reveal them to us.\nMUTUAL VULNERABILITY: A SOURCE OF\nSTRENGTH\nWhen our Second Generation participants spoke of the lowest moments in\ntheir lives, a large proportion of those moments were related to intimate\nrelationships. Deep, intimate connections are by their nature incredibly\nvulnerable situations. When two people who are intimate are in harmony, the\neffect can be exhilarating, but if the relationship falters, the result can cause\nintense emotional pain, feelings of betrayal, and critical self-examination. As\none of our Second Generation participants, Aimee, told the Study:\nMy first husband is from Texas and we moved there after meeting in\nArizona. We lived in a small town raising our daughters, but my husband\nworked in Dallas, so he had to spend nights there occasionally. A friend\ncalled me one night and said he saw my husband being intimate with\nanother friend of ours. My husband admitted to an affair. It destroyed me,\nbut I also felt sure that I could keep going on my own. My daughters and I\nmoved back to Phoenix and lived for two years with my aunt and her\nhusband. As I examined possible reasons for the breakup, I began to\nwonder whether I was just less fun, less exciting after our move to\nTexas. It was something of a blow to my self-confidence as a young\nwoman. Could I be everything to someone, or was I lacking some\nessential \u201cwife\u201d feature?\nTo have an intimate partnership with someone is to expose ourselves to\nrisk. When we trust someone enough to build a life around our relationship\nwith them, that person becomes a kind of keystone. If our connection to them\nfeels precarious, the entire structure of our lives may feel more precarious,\ntoo. That can be a frightening situation. Couples often share not just finances\nand resources, but children, friends, and important connections to each others\u2019\nfamilies. Worries about the relationship failing and causing a domino effect on\nthe rest of our lives can be overwhelming, and can seep down into our\nperception of ourselves. We may wonder, as Aimee did, about our own fitness\nas a partner, and if we\u2019re even capable of fulfilling another person\u2019s needs.\nIf we\u2019ve been hurt before, and most of us have, we might be reluctant to\nfully trust an important relationship. Even if we\u2019ve been with someone for\ndecades, we can still feel a need to protect ourselves.\nMutual, reciprocal vulnerability can lead to stronger and more secure\nrelationships. The ability for partners to trust and be vulnerable with each\nother\u2014to pause, notice their own and their partner\u2019s emotions, and\ncomfortably share their fears\u2014is one of the most powerful relationship skills\nthat a couple can cultivate. It can also relieve a lot of stress, because both\npartners can get the support they need without having to muster energy in an\nattempt to be stronger than they really are.\nIf we do manage to cultivate a strong and trusting bond, we\u2019re still not out\nof the woods , because even the best relationships are susceptible to decay.\nJust as trees need water, intimate relationships are living things, and as the\nseasons of life pass they can\u2019t be left to fend for themselves. They need\nattention, and nour ishment.\nTHE ENDURING INFLUENCE OF INTIMATE\nPARTNERSHIPS\nLove seems the swiftest, but it is the slowest of all growths. No man\nor woman really knows what perfect love is until they have been married\na quarter of a century.\nMark Twain\nAmazing things can happen when a relationship is nurtured over decades.\nOn the other hand, if our most important relationship is neglected, life can\ndevolve into isolation and loneliness.\nFor illustrations of those two paths, let\u2019s go back to Leo DeMarco and\nJohn Marsden, two of our First Generation Harvard Study participants. Leo is\none of the Study\u2019s happiest men, and John one of its unhappiest.\nLeo\u2019s relationship with his wife, which spanned nearly his entire adult\nlife, contained much of what we\u2019ve been saying is key to satisfying\nrelationships: affection, curiosity, empathy, and a willingness to face toward\nchallenging emotions and problems, rather than avoid them.\nFor example, in 1987, Leo\u2019s wife, Grace, told the Study that they had\nsome areas of disagreement, including how much time they should spend\ntogether, how much sex they should be having, and how often they should be\naway from home.\nWhen they disagreed, what did they do? They talked about it, she said.\nThey got to know what the other was thinking, and either accepted the\ndifference or worked something out. And just as importantly, they scaffolded\nthis process with affection.\nJohn Marsden\u2019s wife, Anne, had different responses to the same\nquestionnaire. She often disagreed with John, she said. But what was most\ncorrosive for their relationship was the lack of affection between them. She\nbelieved there should be more\u2014and he also believed there should be more.\nBut they could not figure out how to get there and they didn\u2019t talk about it. He\nrarely confided in her. She rarely confided in him. Were there times, the Study\nasked, when they were apart and she wished they were together? \u201cAlmost\nnever,\u201d she said.\nThe different emotional patterns in each of these marriages stretched\nthrough decades of Leo\u2019s and John\u2019s late lives.\nIn 2004,  we videotaped an interview with Leo in his living room. At one\npoint, the interviewer asks:\n\u201cCan you think of five words that describe your relationship with your\nwife?\u201d\nAfter some stopping and starting, and a few attempts to choose the right\nwords, Leo puts a list together:\nComforting\nChallenging\nFeisty\nPervasive\nBeautiful\nAround the same time, in a different part of the country, John Marsden was\ninterviewed in his personal study. In the video he is surrounded by oak\nshelves full of book s, and a bright window to his right looks out on a garden.\nHe\u2019s asked the same question\u2014\u201cCan you think of five words that describe\nyour relationship with your wife?\u201d\u2014and he shifts in his chair.\n\u201cThis is um, this is a required question I suppos e?\u201d John asks.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s required,\u201d the interviewer responds.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure I could come up with much.\u201d\n\u201cJust do y our best.\u201d\nJohn looks around the room and then methodically recites this list:\nTension\nDistant\nDismissive\nIntolerant\nPainful\nMost of us have relationships that fall somewhere in between\u2014or even\nvacillate between\u2014these two extremes. But in these two relationships we see\na vivid contrast in the quality of intimacy\u2014a contrast between facing\nemotional challenges and avoiding them, between affection and distance,\nbetween empathy and indifference.\nRecall for a moment the Coan handholding study and the Kiecolt-Glaser\nwound-healing study, which are among the many studies that have shown two\ncrucial findings: First, that the presence of a trusted, intimate partner\ndecreases stress, and second, that stress can affect the healing ability of our\nbodies. Of course, we can\u2019t know exactly how much of Leo\u2019s and John\u2019s late-\nlife health was attributable to the amount of love they felt in their closest\nrelationship, bu t we do k now that Leo was physically active deep into his life,\nand that John was very ill for many years. Their relationships are not the only\nreason for that, but the love that Leo shared certainly increased his chances\nfor enduring health, and the pain and distance that John felt in his closest\nrelationship could not have helped him. The same is true for their wives. Over\nthe course of these couples\u2019 lives, their relationships dramatically affected\ntheir happiness, life satisfaction, and almost certainly their physical health.\nIt\u2019s a story that appears in the Harvard Study again and again.\nINTIMACY OVER THE COURSE OF THE\nLIFESPAN\n\nThe graph above  was made by a First Generation Study participant,\nSander Meade, as he looked back on his life when he was in his late 70s. The\nscale on the left-hand side of the graph represents a rating from the \u201cBest of\nTimes\u201d to the \u201cWorst of Times,\u201d and the bottom scale shows a participant\u2019s\nage at the time of each rating. Similar to other participants, many of the big\nshifts in Sander\u2019s life satisfaction coincided with changes in his relationships:\nage 47: \u201cmarriage in trouble\u201d; age 52: \u201cdivorce\u201d; age 55: \u201c2nd marriage\u201d; and\nso on.\nSander\u2019s map of his life reflects a key lesson of the Harvard Study and\nmany other research projects: relationships (and especially intimate\nrelationships) play a crucial role in how satisfied we are at any particular\nmoment in life.\nLife changes of all kinds can cause stress in our intimate partnerships.\nEven positive changes like getting married can be stressful. Young couples,\nfor example, are often surprised by the relationship challenges that arise when\nthey become parents. What was suppos ed to be a joyous beginning of family\nlife becomes a minefield of new disagreements and difficulties compounded\nby exhaustion and worry. New parents often start to have arguments they\u2019d\nnever had before. They are more stressed, and they often feel unsupported by\ntheir partners.\nThis is perfectly normal. Many studies, including our own, show that there\nis often a decline in relationship satisfaction after the birth of a child; it\ndoesn\u2019t mean the relationship is in trouble. Caring for an infant is a major\nchallenge, and much of the time and attention that was once devoted to the\ncouple\u2019s relationship must be diverted to the child. So it\u2019s natural for couples\nto struggle somewhat after they have children.\nOur careful tracking of relationships across the lifespan in the Harvard\nStudy points to that moment when kids leave the nest as another key turning\npoint in intimate relationships. There are lots of anecdotes about a potential\n\u201cempty nest boos t\u201d in marital satisfaction, but our Study is one of the few with\nthe data to track relationships across decades, including this transition point.\nExamining the marriages of hundreds of couples, we find that around the time\nthe last child turns 18, partners commonly begin to experience a noticeable\nincrease in relationship satisfaction.\nEven Joseph Cichy, who did not have the closest marital relationship,\nexperienced this boos t. Using data from the Harvard Study, we can plot\nlifetime trajectories of marital satisfaction, which often look similar to\nJoseph\u2019s (below). Each vertical dotted line represents the birth of a child, the\ngray shading represents the time when Joseph and Olivia were raising\nchildren under the age of 18, and the dark vertical line represents the year the\nlast child\u2014h is daughter Lily\u2014went off to college.\nFor the men in the Study, this empty nest boos t has significance beyond a\ncouple\u2019s marital satisfaction. In fact, we found that the size of the empty nest\nboos t (it varies across couples) predicted how long these participants would\nlive. The larger the boos t in relationship satisfaction after the kids left home,\nthe greater their longevity.\nIntimate connections become particularly important in late life. As we\nage, we encounter more physical challenges, and we need to be able to\ndepend on each other in new ways. When male and female Study participants\nwere in their late 70s and early 80s, those who were more securely attached\nto each other reported better mood and fewer disagreements. Two and a half\nyears later, when we checked back in, those securely attached individuals\nreported feeling more satisfied with life and less depressed, and the wives\nshowed better memory functioning\u2014another piece of evidence suggesting that\nrelationships have an impact on our bodi es and brains.\nJOSEPH CICHY\u2019S MARITAL SATISFACTION ACROSS TIME\nWhen we look at the spectrum of how individuals in intimate relationships\nadapted to change and leaned on each other in old age, Leo DeMarco and\nJohn Marsden are again at oppos ite ends. In the interviews we conducted\nwhen they were in their 80s, we asked bot h of them this question:\nWhen you are upset emotionally or sad or worried about  something that\nis not related to your wife, what do y ou do?\nLeo\u2019s answer was characteristic of someone who feels the warmth of a\nsecure attachment with a partner: \u201cGo to her. Talk with her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s\nvery natural. I certainly don\u2019t keep it to myself. She\u2019s my confidant.\u201d\nJohn\u2019s answer, on the other hand, was emblematic of someone who has\nlearned to cope with vulnerability by avoiding dependence on a partner: \u201cI\nkeep it to myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI tough it out.\u201d\nLate life is a time that brings physical challenges and sickness to many.\nFor some of us that means becoming caregivers again (or for the first time),\nand for some of us that means learning how to accept care. Feeling secure in\nan intimate relationship means both being available to help a partner and\nbeing able to depend on a partner in a time of need. It can be a shock to\nrealize we can no longer reach our own feet to tie our shoes, or that we need\nhelp standing up out of a chair. Having a person beside us with whom we are\nable to share our deepest vulnerabilities can be the difference between a\nsense of despair and well-being. When we\u2019re sick, we also often need\nsomeone to act as our advoc ate\u2014a spokesperson, an organizer, someone to be\nour hands or eyes or ears\u2026 or even our memory. On the other side, being that\nadvoc ate certainly involves self-sacrifice, but it can also be a source of\nsatisfaction.\nTo put it simply: couples who are able to face stresses together reap\nbenefits in health, well-being, and r elationship satisfaction.\nA FINAL NOTE ABOUT OUR \u201cBETTER\nHALVES\u201d\nIn the 1996 r omantic comedy Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise famously echoes\nPlato\u2019s notion of love, when he announces to Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, \u201cYou\u2026\ncomplete me.\u201d\nWhile the feeling that our partners can be our \u201cbetter halves\u201d still rings\ntrue, the practical reality is that very few intimate relationships provide both\npartners with everything they need. Expecting to find completion in our\npartners can lead to frustration and even the dissolution of otherwise positive\nrelationships.\nIn his book The All-or-Nothing Marriage, psychologist Eli Finkel argues\nthat our expectations of marriage have become unrealistic\u2014pa rticularly in the\nU.S. and other Western industrialized countries\u2014and that this is part of the\nreason divorce rates rose sharply in the twentieth century. Before 1850 or so,\nmarriage was essentially a partnership for survival. Between 1850 and 1965,\nthe focus of marriage shifted to include enhanced expectations about\ncompanionship and love. In the twenty-first century, a number of factors in the\neconomy and culture have converged in a way that has piled even higher\nexpectations on intimate relationships. People often are less engaged in their\nlocal communities, and they relocate more for work. This greater mobility\nmeans that fewer people are living near extended family. Many do not stay in\none place long enough to build stable groups of friends. Who do we expect to\nfill all of these gaps? The person beside us.\nWithout realizing it, many of us expect our partners to provide money,\nlove, sex, and to be our best friends. We expect them to provide counsel and\nconversation and to make us laugh. We want them to help us become our best\nselves. We not only ask our partners to do these things for us; we also expect\nto provide these things for them. A lucky few may find themselves in\nrelationships where these high expectations are met reasonably well. In most\nrelationships, it\u2019s too m uch to ask.\nHow do our close relationships get weighted down with so much\nexpectation? Sometimes the reason has less to do with the relationship and\nmore to do with waning connections in other parts of our lives. If we\u2019re no\nlonger having the kind of fun we can only have with a group of friends or\nfamily members who know us well, or we\u2019ve stoppe d pursuing our personal\ninterests, hobbies, and passions, we might turn to our partner to fill those\nneeds. The intimate relationship becomes like a sponge, soaking up whatever\nfailed expectation happens to be lying around. Suddenly we\u2019re finding fault\nwith the person beside us when it\u2019s the rest of our lives and our other\nrelationships that need attention. These expectations can take a toll.\nThe research is clear: intimate relationships can be an incredible source\nof sustenance for our minds and bodies. But there are limits to what they can\ndo. If we want to give a relationship the best chance of success, we have to\nsupport it by sustaining other parts of our lives. Our partners may in fact be\nour better halves, but they can\u2019t, by themselves, make us whole.\nTHE PATH AHEAD\nThere is no remedy for love but to love more.\nHenry David Thoreau\nAs you think about how the things we\u2019ve discussed in this chapter map\nonto your own life, consider using the following practices to nudge a\nrelationship in the direction you\u2019d like it to go.\n\u201cCatch\u201d your partner being kind. What was the last thing your partner\ndid that you felt grateful for? A dinner he made? A backrub she gave you? Or\nmaybe there was a moment you were impatient with your partner, but he didn\u2019t\nhold it against you, and you appreciated that.\nTake note of that small act. Research points to the benefits of keeping a\ngratitude diary to record and solidify the things we feel grateful for, but even\nsimply noticing and calling to mind the good, little things your partner does\ncan have a positive impact. This is a simple but powerful way for us to\n\u201ccatch\u201d our partners being kind rather than falling into the common trap of\ngiving more attention to disappointments. Expressing our gratitude to our\npartner increases the impact further. There are reasons we connected to our\npartners in the first place, and reasons they make our lives better now\u2014it\u2019s\ngood to remember those reasons (and to mention them!). It feels good to be\nappreciated.\nStep out of old routines. As we go about the business of life, our\nrelationships can begin to feel like they are stuck in repetitive cycles that are\nnot exciting.\nEvery night: dinner and TV.\nEvery morning: coffee and oatmeal.\nEvery Sunday: mow the lawn, go to the grocery store, cook the same\ndinner.\nTry something different! Make a plan to surprise your partner with\nbreakfast in bed. Maybe you haven\u2019t walked around your neighborhood\ntogether in years\u2014after dinner instead of falling into the groove s of your usual\nroutine, take a stroll and see what\u2019s out there. Plan a weekly date night and\ntake turns choosing what you will do (and maybe surprise your partner with a\nnew activity if a surprise would be welcome).\nWe all fall into habits and routines. That\u2019s normal. But often they become\nso rote that we cease to really notice our partners as we cruise through the\nday. Breaking these routines alerts our minds to novelty, and this helps us\nrecognize and appreciate our partners in new ways. It also signals to our\npartners that they are important to us.\nAnd there\u2019s always dance class\u2026\nTry the W.I.S.E.R. model (squared). When disagreements arise, consider\nusing the W.I.S.E.R. model (from Chapter Six), and sharing the techniques\nwith your partner. The watch and interpret steps are especially useful in\nintimate relationships. Taking extra time to watch ourselves and our partners\nin an emotional situation can help us see with greater clarity the reasons\nbehind the emotions we are feeling. Introducing some stillness into a moment\nof turmoil can help us clear the muddy water below the surface of our\nrelationship.\nSo when you bump up against something about your partner that bothers\nyou, before reacting, pause to watch, and take note of your reactions and what\nyou are thinking.\nThen interpret your feelings and try to make sense of what\u2019s going on.\nAsk: Why is this issue important to me? What exactly is my view? Where\ndoes it come from? Is this something I learned from my family growing up?\nSomething I learned from previous relationships? Something that was\nemphas ized in my religious training?\nThen, the harder part: try to step into your partner\u2019s shoes. Why is my\npartner having such a strong reaction, behaving in this particular way,\nthinking this particular thing? Why might it be important to my partner and\nwhere might my partner have learned this? Where is it coming from?\nSometimes it\u2019s difficult to start conversations about challenging topics,\nand difficult to move interactions in a new direction. The waters of old\ngrievances tend to run deep. Just telling your partner that the topic makes you\nanxious is a good start. There are a few additional techniques that might be\nuseful in that case.\nOne is known as \u201creflective listening.\u201d It helps us make sure we\u2019re\nhearing correctly what our partner is trying to say, and it shows that we care,\nthat we are trying to empathize. It works like this:\nFirst, listen without commenting.\nThen, try to communicate what you\u2019ve heard your partner say without\njudgm ent (this is the hard part). You might begin with something like: What\nI\u2019m hearing you say is ___. I s that right?\nA second technique that is helpful in its own right and can make reflective\nlistening even more valuable is to offer some understanding of your partner\u2019s\nreasons for a feeling or behavior. The goal is not to point out your brilliance\nand ability to see things your partner cannot, but to let your partner know that\nyou see them. You want to communicate that it makes sense that she feels this\nway or that he is behaving in that way, and to nurture that bedrock of empathy\nand affection that research has shown to be valuable. For example, you might\nsay, It makes sense that you feel so strongly about  this\u2026 and then continue\nwith something like: since you care so much about  being kind. Or: \u2026 since\nthis was the way you\u2019ve described things happe ning in your family growing\nup.\nA third useful practice is to try to step back a bit from the conversation, a\npractice that psychologists call \u201cself-distancing,\u201d and look at your experience\nas if you are watching someone else. You might notice the thoughts that this\nperson (i.e., you) is having, and recognize them as fleeting thoughts that may\nshift. This is a technique that shares much in common with mindfulness\napproaches, and the psychologists Ethan Kross and Ozlem Ayduk have done a\nlot of research showing its utility.\nTogether these practices may help you to get started with challenging\nconversations and hang in there emotionally when things get tough, to slow\ndown, and to show your partner that you\u2019re trying to understand.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to come up with some of your own practices that work in\nyour particular relationship. When you feel yourself getting angry or feeling\ndefeated or scared, remember that it\u2019s a signal. Reach out to your partner in\nthose moments. Try to see beneath the surface, and remember that just like\nyou, your partner is also fighting battles.\nWe each bring our own particular strengths and weaknesses into a\nrelationship, our own fears and desires, enthusiasms and anxieties, and the\ndance that results will always be unlike any other.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t harbor resentment,\u201d Grace DeMarco told the Study in 2004,\nreferring to her relationship with Leo. \u201cWhen we\u2019re pushed hard enough, we\nreally say what we feel, get it out in the open. You can be very different but\nstill respect that difference. And we need the difference, actually. He needs\nthe lightening up and I need the settling dow n.\u201d\n  8  \nFAMILY MATTERS\nCall it a clan, call it a network, call it a tribe, call it a family:\nWhatever you call it, whoever you are, you need one.\nJane Howard, author\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1990\nQ: When you think about your family and relatives, with about how many of them do you\nthink you would say:\nWe share most of our joys and sorrows ______\nWe enjoy doing things together; we share interests ______\nWe really don\u2019t make an effort to keep up with one another ______\nWe avoid each other or we probably don\u2019t like each other much ______\nReading through any file in the Harvard Study can feel a lot like looking\nthrough a family photo album, or watching a montage of old 8mm film. Many\nof the records are handwritten in cursive, the stories themselves are steeped\nin the diction and the feeling of past eras, and time seems to move incredibly\nfast. Entire generations of families go by with the flick of a few pages. A\nparticipant is born, speeds through his teens, gets married, and suddenly a\nboy who was only 14 years old moments ago is now 85, and his adult\nchildren are in our offices talking about what he was like as a parent.\nAlthough there are many insights that have come from the close inspection of\ndetailed data from the Study, a casual look through any file quickly puts two\nparticular things into perspective: 1) the pace at which human life unfolds,\nand 2) the significance of family.\n\u201cWe had a big family, and I\u2019m grateful for the experience of that,\u201d one of\nour Second Generation participants, Linda, told the Study in 2018 when she\nvisited our offices in the West End of Boston. Her father was Neal \u201cMac\u201d\nMcCarthy, one of the Study\u2019s most dedicated First Generation participants,\nand he\u2019d grown up on Lowell Street (now Lomasney Way), not far from\nwhere she now sat. \u201cThere was a lot of energy in our family, a lot of love,\u201d\nLinda told us. \u201cBut when I think of my dad I get emotional because he came\nfrom a totally different situation. He had some hard times as a kid and his\nfamily broke apart. He didn\u2019t finish high school. Went to war. Came out of all\nof that and got his feet under him and somehow he was still a great dad,\nalways there for us, always loving. His life could have gone a completely\ndifferent direction. I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d\nNo relationships are quite like the ones we have with our families. For\nbetter or worse, our family members are often the people most involved in\nour lives when we\u2019re young and developing, and who know us for the longest\nstretch of time. Our parents are the first human beings we see when we arrive\nin the world, the first people to hold and nurture us, and much of what we\nlearn to expect from close relationships comes from them. Our siblings, if we\nhave them, are among our first contemporaries, who show us how to behave\nand also how to get into trouble. Our extended family often defines how we\nunderstand the meaning of community. But whatever the makeup of our\nfamily, it is more than a group of relationships; it is, in a very real way, part\nof who we are. So these relationships come with some very high stakes.\nTheir character can have a dramatic effect on our well-being.\nBut the nature and size of this effect is an ongoing debate in the field of\npsychology. Some believe that early family experience determines who we\nbecome. Others think its effect is largely overrated, and that genes are more\nimportant. Because every one of us has had a long history of firsthand\nexperience with our own families, each of us tends to have strong opinions\nabout how families work, and how much they affect or determine our lives.\nFrom that personal experience come important assumptions about what is and\nis not possible (both in our families of origin and the new families that we\ncreate) and these assumptions often determine how we conduct those\nrelationships.\nWe sometimes think, for example, that the way our family is now is the\nway it will always be, that those relationships are set in stone. We also tend\nto paint both our early and current family experiences in absolute, black-and-\nwhite terms: My parents were horrible\u2026 My childhood was idyllic\u2026 My\nfamily was clueless\u2026 My in-laws are intrusive\u2026 My daught er\u2019s an\nange l\u2026 Are family connections really as frozen across time as we often\npicture them?\nThe Harvard Study captures an enormous range of family experience\nover many decades, and it can help to shed some light on how families really\nwork over time. Close bonds, family feuds, and all variety of successes and\nstruggles are represented. We have the accounts of relationships between\nparents and children as seen from both sides. We have \u201ctraditional\u201d nuclear\nfamily households, single-parent households, multigenerational households,\nfamilies with adopted children, families blended through divorce and\nremarriage, and families with siblings who function more like parents. On\ntop of all of that, more than 40 percent of participants had at least one parent\nwho\u2019d immigrated to the U.S. from another country and faced the challenges\nof raising a family in a foreign land.\nNeal McCarthy\u2019s family was one of these. As first-generation Irish\nimmigrants, his mother and father arrived in the United States only months\nbefore Neal was born, and had their fair share of troubles trying to integrate\ninto a new society. As we\u2019ll see, Neal\u2019s childhood had both nurturing and\ntraumatic elements, and his daughter Linda was right\u2014his life could have\neasily gone in a more negative direction. Many lives in the Harvard Study\ndid. But Neal managed to come out ahead and to live a full and vibrant life\nthat included a loving family of his own. His path through life is both moving\nand instructive.\nIn 2012, when he was 84, Neal mailed in our biennial questionnaire and\non the back wrote a note to Robin Western, one of the Study\u2019s long-term\ncoordinators. The note suggests the flavor of his life at the time, and how far\nhe\u2019d come from his early struggles in Boston\u2019s West End:\nDear Robin,\nTrust this finds you well along with your family.\nCan\u2019t believe I\u2019ve been in this Study for over 70 years!\nAlthough I\u2019m now 84, I\u2019m still very active with my family and friends. Babysitting my five-\nyear-old granddaughter keeps grandpa Mac on his toes, also holiday get-togethers are always\nfun! I read books, do crossword puzzles and attend my 7 grandchildren\u2019s school and sports\nactivities.\nWishing your family and you the best always.\nWould love to hear from you and get an update since we last met.\nBest always,\nNeal McCarthy (Mac)\nIf we\u2019d shown this joyful note to Neal when he was 16 and living through\nthe depths of his family struggles, he might have been very surprised. He\ntraveled a long, long way in his life, and faced some extremely difficult\nchoices along the way. Indeed, one common theme among all of the Harvard\nStudy families, regardless of the size or closeness of the family, the joys or\nthe challenges, is the steady march of change.\nAt any one moment a single family can reflect the entire human life cycle\n\u2014with infants, adolescents, and adults at every stage of life all in\nrelationship to each other. As the life cycle continues to turn, every family\nmember finds themselves on new perches, playing new roles. These shifting\nroles always require some adaptation. Parents who only recently were giving\ntheir adolescent child rides to parties and helping with homework soon have\nto learn to respect her growing independence as she transitions into\nadulthood. Siblings have to negotiate changes in their relationship dynamics\nas their life paths diverge. Adult children have to come to terms with\nproviding support to their aging parents and eventually, in one of the more\ndifficult role changes, to accept late-life support themselves. These\ntransitions require more than adaptation to new roles and responsibilities;\nthey require emotional adaptation, too.\nAs time passes, and everyone\u2019s life stage shifts, relationships must\nchange. How a family adapt s to that inevitable change  is one of the key\ndeterminants of the quality of family relationships. We can\u2019t forever remain\nthe small child with ever-watchful parents, or the young adult in the first\nswells of romantic love, or the new retiree with a grandchild giggling on his\nor her knee. It doesn\u2019t matter how tightly we hang on to a particular beloved\nperch in life; eventually that perch begins to crumble. We have to keep\nmoving, facing into new roles and novel challenges, and it\u2019s always easier to\ndo that together. But how?\nThe emotional lattice of every family is as unique as the structure of a\nflower; similar to other families on first glance, but one of a kind upon close\ninspection. For some of us our family evokes a sense of warm belonging, for\nsome a feeling of estrangement, or even fear. For most of us\u2026 it\u2019s\ncomplicated. This complexity makes research challenging, but by closely\nfollowing hundreds of families over many decades, the Harvard Study is in a\nunique position to find points of overlap among families, and to discover\nsome of the common factors that define the character of our family\nrelationships. This chapter is about bringing together critical pieces of this\nresearch to create a different kind of lens through which you can view the\nparticularity of your own family life. Because one of the resounding truths\nthat we find in the Harvard Study over and ove r is this: family matters.\nWHAT IS A FAMILY?\nNo man is an island\nEntire of itself,\nEvery man is a piece of the continent,\nA part of the main.\nJohn Donne\nIt can be tempting to believe that each of us has more control over our\nown fate than we actually do. The truth is that we are all embedded in\necologies bigger than ourselves that shape us in profound ways. Economies,\ncultures, and subcultures all play important roles in what we believe, how\nwe behave, and the progression of our lives. None of these ecologies is more\nimportant than that of the family.\nBut what is a family, exactly? For most of us, when we think of family,\nwe think of our family. But while for one person family might consist of\nbiological parents, siblings, and children, for another it might mean step-\nrelationships or an enormous range of extended family\u2014in-laws, cousins,\nsecond cousins, nieces and nephews. For others it might extend even further,\nto important connections that go beyond blood r elation.\nAny definition of \u201cfamily\u201d begins with the culture that surrounds it. In\nancient China, the idea of family was shaped by Confucianism and a\ncollectivist ideology that emphasized the health and success of the entire\ngroup. A single household would include parents, grandparents, and children,\nand be the center of life. This model remains strong in China today, even in\nthe era of one-child families. In Ancient Rome a family consisted of all\nmembers of a household, including workers and servants, who lived under\nthe rule of the oldest male, the pater familias. In modern Western culture, the\n\u201cnuclear family,\u201d consisting of two parents and their children, is a common\ndefinition of family, despite the numerous alternatives to this prototype.\n\u201cI have five mommies but only one daddy,\u201d one participant told the Study\nwhen he was 14. His adoptive parents already had grandchildren when he\njoined their family, and he considered his adoptive mother, her two sisters,\nand her two biological daughters to all be mother figures.\nA family can consist of many different arrangements and levels of\ncloseness or distance. Those who haven\u2019t felt the warmth and presence of\nfamily members, whose families have been abusive or have failed to\nunderstand them, may long for and find other connections that feel family-like\nand provide many of the things that they need. One person might have no\nrelationship with their father, but be very close to an uncle, or a grandparent,\nor a different adult from their childhood, like a soccer coach or the mother of\na close friend. Or they might find family in an entirely different community\naltogether.\nIn New York City, Detroit, and many other urban areas in the U.S., a rich\nexample of nontraditional family can be found in \u201cBallroom culture,\u201d in\nwhich members of the LGBTQ+ community, most of them Black and Latino,\njoin groups known as \u201chouses\u201d and organize their lives around supporting\none another and competing together in drag ballroom competitions. Houses\nprovide much needed, family-like connections around shared experiences,\ngoals, and values. Every house functions in a similar way to a blood family,\nwith a house \u201cmother\u201d or \u201cfather\u201d who takes on many of the roles of a\ntraditional parent, and provides some of the positive structure and connection\nmany of the house\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d may have missed out on earlier in their lives.\nAs Marlon M. Bailey puts it in his 2013 book  about Ballroom culture,\nButch Queens Up in Pumps (whose title identifies the ballroom category that\nBailey himself competed in): \u201cIn general, a \u2018house\u2019 does not signify an actual\nbuilding; rather it represents the ways in which its members, who mostly live\nin various locations, view themselves and interact with each other as a\nfamily unit.\u2026 Indeed, especially for LGBTQ+ people of color in their late\nteens and early twenties, this community offers an enduring social sanctuary\nfor those who have been rejected by and marginalized within their families\nof origin, religious institutions, and society at large.\u201d\nThe essential point is that close, nurturing units of people that have a\nformative effect on our lives can come from a variety of places, include a\nvariety of people, and be called any number of things. What matters is not\njust who we consider to be family, but what our closest relationships mean\nto us over the course of our lives.\nThis doesn\u2019t diminish the importance of families of origin, however.\nEven when new families form, or we become a part of new communities that\nprovide us a family structure, we all still carry with us the history of our\nfamilies of origin and the experiences that have impacted us, both positive\nand negative. Even created families, in all of their beauty, and with all of\ntheir love, exist in relief against that earlier experience. Regardless of our\ncurrent lives, we still carry the ghosts of our childhoods , and our memories\nof the people who raised us.\nTHE GHOSTS OF CHILDHOOD\nAt the back of a drawer in Bob\u2019s kitchen is an old aluminum ice cream\nscoop that belonged to his mother. When he was a kid, he\u2019d come in after\nrunning around his Des Moines neighborhood on a summer day and she\u2019d use\nthat scoop to dish up some ice cream for him and maybe have a little bit\nherself. Now more than sixty years later he pulls out that scoop and it\u2019s a\nlittle bit like pulling a memory out of a drawer. The smell of his mother\u2019s\nkitchen, the feeling of that moment in time, is somehow embedded in the ice\ncream scoop.\nMarc has similar heirlooms. On his desk he keeps a small plaque with\nhis grandfather\u2019s name on it. His grandfather was a builder, and displayed the\nplaque on his own desk. When Marc looks at it, he remembers his\ngrandfather teaching him how to use a hammer and nail. He can almost hear\nthe sound of his grandfather\u2019s voice, simultaneously gruff and kind.\nMany of us tend to keep items of significance from our family that\nrepresent things that have meaning for us\u2014bot h good and bad. Certain\nobjects can connect us evocatively to the way things used to be, remind us of\nhow far we\u2019ve come and of lessons we\u2019ve learned.\nThese heirlooms are tokens of a larger kind of inheritance. Not just of\nobjects, but of perspectives, habits, philosophies, and experiences. We can\nhold on to psychological heirlooms just as surely as we hold on to something\nlike an ice scream scoop. Bob\u2019s mother always emphasized being purposely\nkind as a way to connect with others\u2014waiters, strangers, anyone\u2014and today\nBob finds himself trying to follow suit. Marc\u2019s grandfather used to talk often\nabout the pleasure of doing things well, how there\u2019s a certain sound when a\nhammer strikes a nail just right, and though Marc\u2019s not building houses, he\nthinks of that simple lesson often.\nThere is also a darker side of these inheritances, the difficult, even\ntraumatic experiences of childhood that make imprints on us psychologically.\nMarc\u2019s father\u2019s experience of Kristallnacht and escaping the Holocaust\nremained with him for life. Many Harvard Study participants struggled with\nbullying or abusive parents.\nPsychological inheritances can run very deep\u2014s ometimes too deep to\neasily recognize. Beyond the physical features that we inherit from our\nbiological parents, we acquire habits, perspectives, and models of behavior\nfrom family members. Our most important experiences, both good and bad,\nare not just memories. They are emotional events that leave tangible\nimpressions on us, and these influences can shape our lives for a very long\ntime.\nThis can be true for any experience, at any stage of life, but it\u2019s\nespecially relevant for the experiences a child has within their family of\norigin. There\u2019s been a great deal of research and writing about the\nimportance of childhood experience, leading to a wide variety of common\nassumptions about the role childhood plays in adult life. In popu lar culture,\nmovies, and media, a person\u2019s difficult childhood is often cited as the reason\nthey\u2019ve behaved a certain way, so much so that it seems like an accepted\ntruism that childhood de termines one\u2019s fate in life. In a television show, when\nwe are given the backstory of a murderous villain, it always seems to be that\nthey were abused as a child. The trope is so pervasive that those of us\nwho\u2019ve had a rough time as a kid often worry: If I had a terrible childhood\nam I somehow irreparably broken? Am I doom ed to an unhappy  life?\nTROUBLE IN PARADISE\nIn 1955,  a developmental psychologist named Emmy Werner was trying\nto better understand the significance of difficult childhood experiences, so\nshe started a longitudinal study on the Hawaiian island of Kauai designed to\nfollow children from the very day they were born all the way into their\nadulthood. Many of the families she studied were struggling in much the same\nway as immigrant families living in Boston when the Harvard Study began.\nAs Werner wrote:\n[The participants] were children and grandchildren of immigrants\nfrom Southeast Asia and Europe, who had come to Hawaii to work on\nthe sugar plantations. About half came from families in which the fathers\nwere semiskilled or unskilled laborers and the mothers had less than\neight years of education.\u2026 [They were] Japanese, Filipino, Hawaiians,\nand part-Hawaiians, Portuguese, Puerto-Ricans, Chinese, Koreans, and\na small group of Anglo-Saxon Caucasians.\nWhat made this study so remarkable is that Werner didn\u2019t select just a\nfew participants from the island; she managed to include every child born on\nthe island of Kauai in 1955\u2014690 total\u2014and the study lasted for over thirty\nyears.\nUsing data from their childhoods , adolescence, and adult lives, Werner\nwas able to show a clear connection between adverse childhood events and\nthe trajectory of well-being in individual lives. Those children who had a\ncomplicated illness at birth, who had poor experiences with their caretakers,\nand who suffered abuse were more likely to have mental health problems and\nto develop learning disabilities. Their childhood e xperience really mattered.\nBut Werner also found reasons for hope.\nOne third of all children who had adverse childhoods  still managed to\ndevelop into attentive, kind, and emotionally well-adjusted adults. These\nkids overcame their difficult childhoods , and Werner was able to point to\nsome of the reasons.\nThere were protective factors at work for some children that countered\nthe effects of their difficult childhoods . One of the major sources of\nprotection was the consistent presence of at least one caring adult. Even one\nperson who is concerned, available, and emotionally invested in a child\u2019s\nwell-being can positively affect that child\u2019s development and future\nrelationships. Some of the children who thrived despite adversity seemed\nparticularly able to elicit this kind of caring support.\nAs adults, the Harvard Study participants who were able to acknowledge\nchallenges and talk about them more openly seemed to have a similar ability\nto elicit support from others. Being open and clear about one\u2019s experiences\noffers an oppor tunity for another person to be helpful. This ability to\nacknowledge and deal with rather than try to ignore challenges may play an\nimportant role in eliciting support both in childhood and later. Neal\nMcCarthy\u2019s life is a wonderful illustration of how this works, and how we\nmight build on our family experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014in a way that helps\nus thrive.\nTHE ORIGINS (AND DEVELOPMENT) OF OUR\nCOPING ABILITIES\nOn a cold Saturday afternoon in November of 1942, a Harvard Study\ninterviewer visited Neal McCarthy\u2019s family for the first time at their home in\nBoston\u2019s West End. If we flip to the very beginning of Neal\u2019s records, we can\nfind the interviewer\u2019s notes from that day. Their three-room apartment was\nlively and bustling, the interviewer wrote, with the six kids doing chores and\njoking around, saying hello to the stranger in a shirt and tie sitting at their\nkitchen table. One of Neal\u2019s brothers was washing the dishes that had piled\nup. Neal was busy teaching his youngest sister how to tie her shoes. He was\n14 years old.\nIn the late 1930s  and early 1940s , researchers conducted these visits to\nthe homes of our First Generation participants to see what their family lives\nwere like. How strict and how kind were their parents? How present? How\ninvolved? Did the parents have a consistent positive emotional connection\nwith their children, or were they withdrawn or only sporadically attentive?\nDid the family argue a lot? In short: How warm and supportive were these\nchildren\u2019s family environments?\nBoth Neal\u2019s parents were born in Ireland and immigrated to the U.S. only\nmonths before Neal was born. During the Study\u2019s first visit, Mary, Neal\u2019s\nmother, made tea for the interviewer and sat at the kitchen table answering\nquestions about the family\u2019s history. Occasionally one of the kids would\ncome through to announce the completion of a task or ask permission to go\nsee a friend. \u201cThe children all respect Neal\u2019s mother,\u201d the interviewer wrote.\n\u201cShe is a kind and good-natured person and the children do center around her\nand there is a warm affection both ways. She is particularly proud of Neal\nbecause he is so good a nd she doesn\u2019t have to worry about him.\u201d\nLike many of the participants in the inner-city sample, Neal worked from\na very young age. He started delivering groceries and newspapers at age 10,\nand on Sundays he\u2019d go into the wealthy \u201clace curtain Irish neighborhood\u201d\nacross town and shine shoes for people as they were coming out of church.\nRemembering these early years as an older man, Neal told the Study that he\ngave most of the money he made to his mother to use for family expenses.\n\u201cI\u2019d bring my take home and give her usually about four bucks. And she\u2019d\nthink that was pretty good. But she wouldn\u2019t know I had a buck in my hat!\u201d\nMany afternoons he\u2019d go to the bowling alley and set up pins so they\u2019d let\nhim play for free.\nHis mother paid special attention to who Neal chose as friends, and when\nthe interviewer asked Neal why he thought he had stayed out of trouble in a\nneighborhood where many of his peers had not, Neal said, \u201cI don\u2019t run\naround with dumbbells.\u201d\nNeal\u2019s father, a dockworker, was also well respected by the children. He\nwas kind and firm, though it was clear that his mother ran the household.\nNeal was one of a large sample of Harvard Study participants that we\nused to investigate the effect of childhood experience on participants\u2019 adult\nlives. We wanted to know: Could the echo of early family experiences be\nheard throughout a person\u2019s entire life? With careful notes and ratings from\ninitial visits like the one to Neal\u2019s family home, we were able to form\npictures of participants\u2019 childhood family environments. In Neal\u2019s case, the\nfamily environment was considered very positive. His parents were\nnurturing, involved, consistent, and fostered their children\u2019s autonomy. The\nfamily environment as a whole was rated as warm and cohesive.\nNow let\u2019s flip forward in the record to more than sixty years later, when\nwe interviewed participants in their homes when they were in their 70s and\n80s. During these visits we paid particular attention to the security of their\nconnections with their partners. Did they display loving behavior? Were they\ncomfortable in seeking and giving support? Did they value or devalue their\npartner? We relied not just on the face value of their responses but also the\nbelievability and consistency of their comments.\nWhen we interviewed Neal and his wife, Gail, it quickly became clear\nthat they were securely attached. When asked separately to describe their\nrelationship, the words they chose were remarkably similar. Loving,\ncommunicative, tender, affectionate, comfortable, Neal said. Tender, open,\ngiving, unde rstanding, affectionate, Gail said. And they both provided rich\nexamples in their interviews to support these adjectives in a persuasive way.\nAt that time, Gail was becoming increasingly incapacitated by Parkinson\u2019s\ndisease, and had been struggling with it for several years. They were living\nin Seattle, Washington, where Neal ran an accounting firm that he cofounded,\nand Gail talked about how Neal had changed his professional life to help\ncare for her, taking on only as many clients as he could handle while still\ngiving her the necessary attention. He learned to cook her favorite meals and\ntook over all the household responsibilities. But she insisted that he keep up\nhis hobby  of birdwatching, saying \u201cFind a good one for me!\u201d on his way out\nthe door .\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about warblers,\u201d she told the Study.\nThis research in a way book ended the lives of our participants. We\npurposely went to the far extremes of the data\u2014the very beginning and close\nto the end\u2014looking for associations between childhood and late-life\nfunctioning. Given the passage of over six decades, we ourselves were not\ncertain this kind of connection across relationships would be found. But our\nhypothesis proved accurate: the men who, like Neal, had closer and warmer\nexperiences in early family life were more likely to be able to connect with,\ndepend on, and support their partner more than sixty years later. The strength\nof the connection across sixty years was not immense, but it was clear that\nour participants\u2019 childhoods  were like long, thin threads, gently tugging on\ntheir adult lives from across the decades.\nAfter discovering this link came the crucial question: How does this\nwork? How exactly does the quality of people\u2019s childhoods  affect their adult\nlives?\nHere is where Emmy Werner\u2019s research, our own Harvard Study\nresearch, and many other pieces of research from across cultures and\npopu lations converge to show that a critical link between childhood\nexperience and positive adult social conne ctions is our ability to process\nemotions.\nIt is from our relationships as children\u2014especially our relationships\nwith our family\u2014that we first learn what to expect from others. This is when\nwe begin to develop the emotional habits, so to speak, that will be with us\nfor the rest of our lives. These habits often define the way we connect to\nothers and our ability to engage others in mutually supportive ways.\nA crucial point here is that our ability to process emotions is malleable.\nIn fact, managi ng emotions is one of the things we actually get better at as\nwe grow old. And there is strong evidence that we don\u2019t have to wait until\nlate in our lives for this to happe n. With the right guidanc e and some\npractice, we can learn to be better at managi ng our  feelings at any age.\nThe connections between our childhood experience and our adult lives\nare not so strong that they can\u2019t be altered. Any experience we have, even as\nadults, has the power to change us. There are participants in the Study, for\nexample, who had warm and loving childhoods , but then had difficult\nexperiences later on that changed the way they approached relationships.\nThere are also participants who had difficult childhoods , but their later\nexperiences helped them learn how to trust and connect with others.\nNeal is a particularly interesting and encouraging case for exactly this\nreason, because while his early childhood was about as positive an\nexperience as can be found in the Harvard Study, that warmth did not last\nforever. Shortly after the Harvard Study\u2019s first visit, everything changed for\nthe McCarthy family, and the coming years would put the positive habits he\u2019d\nlearned as a child to the test.\nTROUBLE IN THE MCCARTHY FAMILY\nWhen the Harvard Study first visited Neal\u2019s family, his mother was\nextremely candid about many details of their family life, painting a broad and\nrealistic picture of the family\u2019s ups and downs. But there was one crucial\nthing she did not mention during that first visit: she had personally begun\nstruggling, mightily, with an addiction to alcohol.\nFor many years Mary had managed her drinking in ways that did not\ninterfere with raising the children and keeping her family thriving. She drank\nin private, and managed to control the amount and timing of her drinking. But\nshortly after the Study\u2019s first visit to the McCarthy home, Mary began to lose\ncontrol. Soon she was drinking to intoxication every day. The household\nbecame tumultuous and even traumatic for the children as she and Neal\u2019s\nfather began to have loud, raucous fights about her drinking and the way it\nwas affecting the family. There would be screaming and sometimes violence,\nfrom both Neal\u2019s parents. Neal loved his parents, and in an effort to support\nhis fracturing family, he droppe d out of high school at 15 to go to work. He\nlived at home until he was 19, helping to support the family and provide a\nstable resource for his younger siblings. As we\u2019ve seen in previous cases,\nhis experience of taking on early work and responsibility was not unusual for\nthe inner-city Study participants.\nNeal carried vivid memories of this period of turmoil with him for the\nrest of his life\u2014the shouting, the violence and injuries, the stress, his\nmother\u2019s drunkenness and the family\u2019s pervading sadness. He lived at home\nuntil he felt like he could no longer do a nything more to help.\n\u201cI just had to leave,\u201d he told a Study interviewer, tearfully, when he was\nin his 60s. \u201cI had to. My mother was an alcoholic. Her and Daddy used to\nfight.\u201d\nLike many of the children in Werner\u2019s Kauai longitudinal study, Neal\u2019s\nfamily life was a complex, unfolding web of experience and feeling, of love\nand frustration, of closeness and estrangement, of good and bad. Neal\u2019s\nfamily, like most families, was complicated.\nBut Neal\u2019s case shows the power that we all have to define our own\nstory. He experienced first a warm, loving childhood environment, and later\n\u2014when his mother descended into alcoholism\u2014a tumultuous and difficult\nadolescence. Both experiences affected him deeply. Yet he was able to draw\non his positive experiences in order to put his negative experiences in\nperspective, rather than the other way around. He also had that one present,\nattentive adult in his life\u2014his dad. Together, these resources gave him the\nstrength and confidence to handle any emotional challenge he faced.\n\u201cI knew that wasn\u2019t how I wanted to live,\u201d he told the Study about his\nteenage years, and watching his parents. \u201cFighting, drinking, screaming.\nWhen I got older I didn\u2019t want my kids experiencing that, and I didn\u2019t want to\nexperience it myself, ever again.\u201d\nAt the age of 19, Neal escaped his family home by enlisting in the Army.\nHe fought in the Korean War, and when he was discharged he got his high\nschool GED. He used his veterans benefits to go to college, where he met\nGail, and fell in love. Exactly eleven days after he graduated college, Neal\nand Gail were married. Only a short time later his mother died of\ncomplications related to her drinking. She was only 55.\nOver a lifetime of experience, Neal developed his ability to reflect on\nwhatever might happen to him and to consider his own emotions before\nacting. He was able to step back, acknowledge his challenges, and give\nhimself the space to find a path forward. And he would need these skills.\nNeal might have had a tumultuous, traumatic adolescence, and fought in a\nwar, but according to him, it wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d had a family and children of\nhis own that he faced the most difficult challenge of his life.\nNEAL MEETS THE UNEXPECTED\nCHALLENGES OF FAMILY LIFE\nBy the time he was 56, Neal \u201cMac\u201d McCarthy and his wife, Gail, were\nthe proud parents of four children, all adults. Each of his kids, he told the\nStudy, was smarter than he was and\u2014h e emphasized\u2014k ind. His oldest son\nand daughter, twins, had both gone to college. His son was now an\naccountant and his daughter Linda (the Second Generation participant we\nheard from at the beginning of this chapter) got her PhD and became a\nchemist. This achievement amazed Neal; Linda was the first PhD in his\nfamily. His middle son married young and was living in Costa Rica. His\nyoungest daughter, Lucy, was a brilliant kid, he said, with a lot of potential.\nAs an adolescent, Lucy was fascinated by astrophysics and space, and\ndreamed of becoming an engineer for NASA. \u201cShe\u2019s so smart it\u2019s scary,\u201d\nNeal said at the time.\nBut as the years went by certain challenges arose for Lucy that neither\nNeal nor Gail knew how to handle. Lucy had been shy, had a hard time\nmaking friends as a child, and was bullied in primary school. Her home life\nwas a safe haven, and her brothers and sister looked out for her, but her\nexperience away from home continued to be a challenge. In high school, she\nmade few new friends, began skipping classes, and, unbeknownst to her\nparents for several years, started drinking to excess. After high school Lucy\ncontinued to live with Neal and Gail. She was fired from several jobs for\nabsences and would sometimes spend days in her room, not wanting to come\nout. Once she was arrested for stealing a watch from a department store.\nLucy\u2019s drinking was especially alarming to Neal because of his mother\u2019s\nexperience. Had he passed on some addiction genes to Lucy? Would she\nfollow in his mother\u2019s footsteps?\nThe family rallied around Lucy as best they could. Her siblings were\navailable to her, and her older brother Tim called her often to check in. Lucy\nfelt more comfortable talking to him about some things, and felt more\ncomfortable talking to her parents about other things. Neal and Gail gave her\nthe space she seemed to prefer, but they didn\u2019t want to detach too much. Gail\nmade an effort to find the right therapist for her\u2014going through several\nbefore finding one that Lucy was at ease with. Often Lucy would seem to be\nimproving, only to fall on hard times again. She was diagnosed with\ndepression and began taking medication. That helped, but it wasn\u2019t a\ncomplete solution. Lucy\u2019s two oldest siblings had gone to college, and she\nwanted to do the same, but when it came time to apply, she couldn\u2019t bring\nherself to do it. She started working at restaurants around Seattle instead,\nliving with her parents and sometimes trying to venture out and live by\nherself. Once, when Lucy was 25, Neal came home from work between\nmeetings to find her at the kitchen table, sobbing uncontrollably, saying she\ndidn\u2019t want to live anymore. He didn\u2019t know what to say to her, and was\nafraid of saying the wrong thing. He canceled his appointments and made\ncoffee and sandwiches and sat with her. She left crying before her mother\ncould come home.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d Neal told the Study. \u201cWe try to be there for\nher but we feel like we\u2019re out of options. I make sure to tell her I love her.\nShe\u2019s living on her own now and I lend her resources when she needs them.\nShe never wants to take money but sometimes I have to insist because I don\u2019t\nwant to see her living on the street. Ever since she was a kid I\u2019ve given\nprobably 80 percent of my attention to Lucy because of her troubles, and the\nother kids got the last 20 percent. They never complained but I know it was\nhard for them. That\u2019s just the way it is, I guess.\u201d\nLucy\u2019s problems complicated her transition into adulthood, but her\nsituation contained the same developmental dilemmas that all families face\nwith young adults: when should a parent intervene rather than step back, and\nwhat kind of support is best? From the young adult\u2019s side the same dilemma\nexists in mirror image: How do I get what I need from my parents when\nthings are not going well, yet still work toward being as grown-up as I think I\nshould be?\nEvery family faces challenges, and sometimes these problems are not\nreally fixable. There is a Western idea, particularly in the United States, that\nwe ought to be able to conquer all problems. If a problem doesn\u2019t seem\nconquerable, the response is often to turn away entirely. The choices\nbecome: I must do e verything, or I can\u2019t do any thing.\nBut there is a middle way. We\u2019ve been advoc ating a strategy of facing\ntoward problems, rather than avoiding them, but facing a problem is not\nalways the same as fixing it. Sometimes facing-in to our families means\nlearning how to sit with uncomfortable situations and emotions, and allowing\nourselves to feel and express the emotions that many of us try to avoid.\nSometimes the best thing we can do is respond in a way that is less absolute\nand more flexible, as Neal and Gail managed to do.\nNeal and Gail were at a crossroad: Should they try their best to engage\nwith Lucy and her challenges? Or should they back off a bit and give Lucy\nmore room to either flounder or thrive on her own? While they struggled with\nthese questions, their response was most often to face toward Lucy\u2019s\ndifficulty rather than minimizing it or pretending there was not a problem.\nWhen Lucy pushed them away, they didn\u2019t throw their hands up and cut her\noff. Instead, they gave her room, and waited for another oppor tunity. Lucy\u2019s\nsiblings also gave needed support to their parents and to Lucy. All through\nthe experience, even in times of shouting and fighting, the family\u2019s love for\neach other would eventually surface. They remained flexible, though none of\nthem was perfect. Sometimes they had to step back, sometimes they had to\nstep in. But they never turned aw ay.\nStill, like many in his situation, Neal couldn\u2019t help but wonder if any of\nthis was the right strategy. It was hard to tell if they were doing the right\nthings, and he worried about his own contributions to Lucy\u2019s misery.\n\u201cCan I get your professional opinion?\u201d Neal once asked a Study\ninterviewer, thirty years his junior, in a discussion about his daughter. \u201cIs\nthere anything more I can do for her? Do you think I\u2019ve done something\nwrong?\u201d\nIt\u2019s natural to feel responsible for our kids\u2019 failures as well as their\nsuccesses, even when much of it is not within our control. Parents often face\nfeelings of guilt when their children encounter problems in life. Sometimes\nthese guilty feelings become yet another reason to turn away from problems;\nwe just can\u2019t handle facing those emotions. It took bravery on Neal\u2019s part to\ngive voice to a question that many parents find themselves asking when their\nchildren have difficulties in life: Is it my fault?\nNeal never managed to answer this question fully for himself; it stayed on\nhis mind even as Lucy aged into her 30s and 40s still experiencing ups and\ndowns, periods of homelessness, and problems with addiction.\nIt\u2019s true that childhood matters, and parenting matters, but no single\nelement of a person\u2019s life fully shapes their future. Parents can neither take as\nmuch credit nor as much blame as they think they should for the way their\nchildren turn out. Nature and nurture, heredity and environment, parenting and\npeers are all tightly woven together, and all have served to mold each of us\ninto the adults we are today. Finding a definitive reason for why a particular\nperson is having the struggles they are having is not always possible. All we\ncan do is to meet our emotions, as Neal did, with as much bravery as we can,\nand respond in the best way we know how.\nCORRECTIVE EXPERIENCES (AND STARTING\nNOW)\nSo what do we do if most of our childhood experience was incredibly\nrough, or even traumatic? Is there still hope for those of us who, unlike Neal,\nhad nothing but trouble when we were young?\nThe answer is an emphatic Yes. There is hope. This goes for everyone,\nwhether your experience in childhood was difficult, or whether you find\nyourselves having troubles today. Childhood isn\u2019t the only time of life when\nexperience is formative. Anything we experience, at any time, can change\nwhat we expect from others. It often happens that a powerful, positive\nexperience will have a corrective effect on an earlier, negative experience. If\nwe grew up with a domineering father, we might later become close with a\nfriend whose father behaves in a completely different way. Because the\nfriend\u2019s father doesn\u2019t live up to our worst expectations, our perspective can\nundergo a subtle shift. Now we might be more open to other possibilities.\nWe are having these experiences all the time, whether we realize it or\nnot. Life, in a way, is a long oppor tunity for corrective experiences. Finding\nthe right partner, for example, can go a long way toward correcting\nassumptions and expectations that we developed in childhood. Therapy can\nalso be helpful, in part because of the connection with a caring, consistent\nadult.\nCorrective experiences aren\u2019t just a matter of luck, either. Opportunities\nto shift our view of the world are arriving all the time\u2014most of them simply\npass us by. We are often too tunneled into our own expectations and personal\nopinions to allow the subtle realities of these oppor tunities to penetrate. But\nthere are a couple of simple (though difficult!) things we can do to encourage\nour ability to see what\u2019s really happening, and thus be more likely to reap the\nbenefits of corrective experience.\nFirst, we can tune in to difficult feelings rather than try to ignore them.\nPart of leaning in to challenges involves seeing our emotional reactions as\nuseful information rather than as something to be pushed away.\nSecond, we can notice when we are having experiences that are more\npositive than we expected. Maybe in the middle of that family reunion you\nwere dreading for months, you can pause and realize that, against all odds ,\nyou\u2019re having a pretty good t ime.\nThird, we can try to \u201ccatch\u201d other people when they are behaving well,\njust as we sugge sted you might do with a partner. Most of us are very good\nat noticing when people are behaving badly, but we\u2019re not so skilled at\nnoticing when people are behaving well. On the road, good drivers fade into\nthe background, but bad drivers stand out. We learn to expect bad driving, so\nthat we\u2019re prepared for it when it happens. The same is true in life.\nOccasionally, try to notice the good dr ivers, the good pe ople.\nThe final and most powerful approach is simply to remain open to the\npossibility of people behaving differently than we expect. The more ready\nwe are to be surprised by people, the more likely we are to notice when\nthey do something that doesn\u2019t match our expectation. This kind of noticing\nis especially important within our families.\nCONFRONTING OUR CURRENT FAMILY\nPERSPECTIVES\nIn every family we develop images of each other that we then confirm for\nourselves again and again: My older sister is always bossy\u2026 My dad is\nalways giving me a hard time\u2026 M y husband never notices anything\u2026\nThis is what we call the \u201cYou Always / You Never\u201d trap. Our experience\nwith our family members starts so early in life that our expectations about\nrelationships become deeply imprinted, and anything that happens, no matter\nhow subtle, often gets pressed into that old imprint. We have to remember\nthat as we grow and change throughout our lives, so do our family members;\nby not giving them the benefit of the doubt, we may not see how they have\nchanged.\nMy dad actually called me today \u2014he always expects me to be the one\nto reach out , that\u2019s a big step for him.\nMy daug hter helped her brother with his homework tonight. I wouldn\u2019t\nhave expected that, I\u2019ll make sure to thank  her.\nMy mother-in-law hasn\u2019t always been there for me, but she came\nthrough when my child was sick recently. It seems like she\u2019s trying, and\nthat\u2019s important.\nIn Chapter Five we mentioned a meditation instruction that\u2019s useful in\nenhancing our everyday ability to notice and pay attention to the world, and\nthis meditation is equally useful when we interact with our families. It is to\nask ourselves the question: What\u2019s here that I\u2019ve never noticed before?\nIt can be asked about a relationship just as easily as it can be asked about\nan environment. What is there about my relationship with this person that\nI\u2019ve never noticed before? What have I been missing?\nWhen you go to Thanksgiving dinner and have to sit next to your brother-\nin-law who constantly insists that everyone should learn to write computer\nprogramming code, or you find yourself cornered by an aunt who wants to\ntalk only about her pet Bichons, try making that question your mantra, at least\nfor the first few minutes (a person can only do so much). What is there about\nthis person that I\u2019ve never noticed before? You might be surprised by what\nyou discover.\nOne thing we can be sure of\u2014nobody  we encounter in life can ever be\nfully known. There is always more to discover. Making those discoveries,\nand taking them to heart, can sometimes correct biases that have been stifling\nour relationships with the people we\u2019ve known the longest\u2014ou r families.\nFAMILY RELATIONSHIPS: WHY THEY\u2019RE\nWORTH THE TROUBLE\nSometimes it seems like our families are more permanent than they are;\nwe think our families will always be with us and will always be the way\nthey are now. But as each family member passes into new life stages, the\nroles we play shift, and it\u2019s often when those shifts happen without our\nnoticing that family problems begin to develop. Adolescents don\u2019t need the\nsame attentiveness they required at age two. Parents or grandparents need\nmore help in their 80s than in their 60s. New mothers may need a family\nmember\u2019s help, but not their advice. Sometimes we may need to ask\nourselves: What\u2019s an appropriate role for me to play with this person at\nthis stage of our family life?\nEach of us has different knowledge, abilities, and sets of experiences,\nand these different forms of family \u201cwealth\u201d can be drawn upon when\nchanges occur. A brother who overcame bullying as a child may be able to\nhelp your young son who\u2019s experiencing the same thing. But to take advantage\nof these forms of wealth, we have to stay in touch with each other. And we\nmay need to ask for that help, to ask for a change in roles.\nIn addition to new challenges caused by shifting roles, families can drift\napart as time passes, for reasons both big and small. Even a small\ndisagreement can lead to neglect that then leads to the end of an important\nfamily relationship. When one family member moves away, the\ninconvenience of visits can mean that the entire family rarely gets together.\nRecall the how-much-time-is-left relationship equation from Chapter Four\u2014\nfor a family member who rarely comes around, a family\u2019s time with that\nperson may add up to only a few days over the course of the rest of their\nlives. Keeping connections going takes effort. If the reason for disconnection\nis not geographic, but emotional, then maintaining connection might mean\ndeveloping a willingness to face feelings of guilt, sadness, or resentment.\nThe complex emotional lattice of every family is unique in important\nways, and our families affect us in ways that other relationships do not.\nFamilies share history, experience, and blood as no other relationships can.\nWe can\u2019t replace a person we\u2019ve known for our entire lives. More\nimportantly, we can\u2019t replace a person who\u2019s known us for our entire lives.\nNurturing and enriching these relationships despite challenges, persevering,\nand appreciating the positive things we get from them is worth the trouble.\nBob thinks of a moment when, as a young man, he was going through a time in\nwhich he was incredibly angry at his parents, and an uncle took him aside. I\nknow you\u2019re mad, his uncle said. But just remember: nobody  is ever going\nto care about  you this much ever agai n.\nTHE PATH AHEAD\nEarlier in this chapter, we offered some pointers for leaving yourself\nopen to those unexpected corrective experiences that can happen with family\nmembers when you least expect them. But we can also be proactive in\nstrengthening family connections. Of course, what works for one family may\nnot work for another. But there are some general principles that can help\ncultivate strong bonds for both immediate and extended families. Here are a\nfew things to think about:\nFirst, start with yourself. What kinds of automatic reactions do you have\nto your family members? Are you passing judgment based on past\nexperiences, and foreclosing the oppor tunity for something different to\nhappen?\nOne simple thing we can all do is to notice when we find ourselves\nwanting someone to be different than they are. We can ask ourselves, What\nif I just let this person be themselves without passing judgment? How\nwould this moment be different? Recognizing another person for who they\nare and meeting them where they are can go a long way toward deepening a\nconnection.\nSecond, routines are important. We mentioned in Chapter Seven that one\nway to enliven intimate relationships is to step out of routines. While\nbreaking up routines can also be great for families who find themselves stuck\nin the doldrums, the fact is that family relationships are often defined by\ntheir regular contact. This is true for families that live under the same roof\ntogether, and it\u2019s especially true for families that are living apart. Regular\nget-togethers, dinners, phone calls, and text messages all serve, in\ncombination, to glue a family together. As life changes and becomes more\ncomplicated, finding new rituals can help keep family conne ctions alive\nwhen they would otherwise wither. Regular contact used to happen more\noften through religious events like baptisms, Ramadan, and bar/bat mitzvahs.\nThese still occur of course, but as the world becomes more secular, some\nfamilies struggle to find replacements.\nSocial media tools can help here. Some families that would otherwise\ndrift apart might do well to create more regular contact online.\nVideoconferencing software is especially powerful, because it allows for\nmore communication through facial expression and body  language.\nParticularly during the Covid-19 pandemic lockdowns, videoconferencing\nwas a lifesaver for many families.\nWe\u2019d do well to remember, however, that there is always the danger that\nrelying on social media and video calls can create the illusion that we\u2019re\nmaintaining significant contact, when in fact it\u2019s more superficial. There are\nmysterious and subtle currents of feeling that pass between two people who\nare physically present with each other. The late night, intimate conversations\nthat Rachel DeMarco described having with her father, Leo, in Chapter Five\nmight not have happened had she not been there in the room with him, the\nlights dimmed, the family cat on her lap.\nThere also might be some overlooked oppor tunities to connect with our\nimmediate families during daily routines. One of the most powerful of these\nroutines happens to be one of the simplest, and the oldest: family dinners.\nAny excuse to gather the family together and talk is a good excuse, and\nthere is evidence that it might be especially beneficial for kids. Researchers\nhave found that regular family dinners are associated with children\u2019s higher\ngrade-point averages and higher self-esteem, along with lower rates of\nsubstance abuse, teen pregnancy, and depression. There is also evidence that\neating at home more often leads to healthier dietary habits. Some cultures\nmake meals a centerpiece of family life, but in the Western world, people are\neating more meals alone than ever before, with adults in the U.S. eating about\nhalf of their meals alone. That is a lot of missed oppor tunity for connection.\nFamily dinners are a regular opportunity to check in with everyone and keep\nfamily members up to date on one another\u2019s lives. Even if some of us are\nannoyed at the routine, it can have the important effect of making everyone\nfeel like they aren\u2019t on their own. Adults can model for young children the\nrules of turn-taking in conversation, sharing, and listening to others\u2019\nexperiences with curiosity, and adults can learn from their kids about cultural\ntrends. And don\u2019t underestimate the importance of being together, even if\nthere\u2019s not always great conversation. Sometimes important information is\nconveyed not by what our family members say, but by how it feels to be in a\nroom with them. Texts and shouts between rooms have a hard time competing\nwith what we communicate in even fifteen minutes of sitting together at a\ntable. If your family\u2019s schedule doesn\u2019t allow for dinners, then breakfasts\nmight serve the same function. Every human being needs to eat. As often as\nwe can, we should do i t together.\nFinally, remember that every member of the family has their own store\nof buried treasure, unique things that only they can provide to the family but\nthat may be hidden in plain sight. Consider, for example, the grandparents\nwho have accumulated entire lifetimes of experience. Their sense of\ngenerational identity, of how family members overcame major challenges in\nthe past, and their fund of knowledge about family history can give us\nperspectives on the present day that are not available through other means.\nFamily stories are important for bonding and maintaining connections. What\nare the questions you want to ask your aging family members now, before it\u2019s\ntoo late? What do you want to share with your kids? Asking older relatives\nfor stories about the family can be a way to keep people connected. Short\nvideos, films, and photos can matter a lot, especially after people have\npassed away. New ways to preserve family history and connection are\narising all the time\u2014it benefits us to take advantage of them.\nIt\u2019s not only older generations whose memories are valuable. If you have\nsiblings, their memories of growing up can enrich your own. If your kids are\ngrown, asking them what they remember about their childhood can give you a\nnew perspective on them and on your own experiences as a parent. Shared\nmemories deepen connections.\nThe Harvard Study, in a way, is a massive experiment in this kind of\nfamily inquiry. When we open up an individual file and get that nostalgic\nfeeling of looking through a family photo album, we do it in the spirit of\ninvestigation. But you don\u2019t need grant funding and the support of an\nacademic institution to mine the treasures that are there in your own family. It\ntakes only curiosity and time. You might find some surprises, good and bad,\nthat enrich your understanding of your family.\nNeal McCarthy\u2019s kids took advantage of his memory in this way, and had\nseveral conversations with their father about his early life. He didn\u2019t tell\nthem everything\u2014not as much, it seems, as he told the Harvard Study\u2014bu t\nhe told them enough for them to know that he\u2019d had both some great times and\nsome incredibly hard times.\nIn the end, the most important thing was something they saw firsthand:\nwhen he formed a family of his own, he didn\u2019t run from challenges, he didn\u2019t\nperpetuate the things that made his childhood hard, and he gave his family the\ngift of his steady presence. Even if he made mistakes, he didn\u2019t turn away\nfrom them. He was there. When asked what advice she would give to the\nfuture generation, his daughter Linda gave an answer inspired by her father,\ntelling the Study, \u201cI\u2019d just say never forget what this life is truly about. It\u2019s\nnot about how much money you make. That\u2019s what I learned from my dad. It\u2019s\nabout the person he was to me, to my child, my sisters and my brother, his\nseven grandchildren. If I can be half that I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d\n  9  \nTHE GOOD LIFE AT WORK\nInvesting in Connections\nJudge each day not by the harvest you reap but by the seeds you\nplant.\nWilliam Arthur Ward\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1979:\nQ: If you could stop working without loss of income, would you? What would you do instead?\nOver the next twenty-four hours, billions of people across the world will\nwake up and go to work. Some will head off to jobs that they\u2019ve strived\ntoward for their entire lives, but most will have little or no choice about the\ntype of work they do, or about the amount of money they make doing it. The\npurpose of working, for most people, is primarily to provide for themselves\nand their families. Henry Keane, one of the Harvard Study\u2019s inner-city\nBoston participants, worked in an automobile factory in Michigan for most of\nhis life\u2014not because he loved to build cars, but because it provided a decent\nliving. He grew up poor, and he started working early in life. He did not\nreceive the same advantages that Harvard-educated men like John Marsden\n(Chapter Two) or Sterling Ainsley (Chapter Four) received, and he didn\u2019t\nmake nearly as much money. Yet Henry was by any measure happier in his\nlife than either John or Sterling. Like Henry, most of the other inner-city\nStudy participants had fewer career choices, worked harder jobs, made less\nmoney, and retired at a later age than the Harvard men. These elements of\ntheir work certainly had an effect on their health and ability to flourish. And\nyet, Harvard-educated participants\u2019 better pay and greater status was no\nguarantee of a flourishing life. There are many participants in the Harvard\nStudy who held \u201cdream jobs\u201d\u2014from medical researchers to successful\nauthors to wealthy Wall Street brokers\u2014who were nonetheless unhappy at\nwork. And there are inner-city participants who held \u201cunimportant\u201d or\ndifficult jobs and yet derived much satisfaction and meaning from them.\nWhy? What is the missing piece?\nIn this chapter we focus on one important aspect of work that many of us,\nregardless of what we do for a living, often overlook: the impact that our\nrelationships at work have on our life. Not only because these relationships\nare important to our well-being, as we\u2019ve discussed, but also because\nthey\u2019re aspects of our work lives that we have some control over, and that\nhave the potential to improve our daily experience immediately. We may not\nalways get to choose what we do for a living, but making work work for us\nmay be more possible than we think.\nTWO DAYS IN THE LIFE\nLet\u2019s imagine a couple of days in the life of a worker, we\u2019ll call her\nLoren, who\u2019s experiencing a number of common challenges the two of us see\noften, both in the lives of research participants and in our clinical work.\nFor the last six months, Loren has had a job at a medical billing office\nthat handles several doctors\u2019 practices. Her coworkers, seated in cubicles\naround her, are good people, but she doesn\u2019t know them very well. Each day\nthe thing she wants most is to finish her accounts and head home, where an\nentirely different set of challenges awaits. Unfortunately, ending the day on\ntime has been difficult recently because her company has just taken on a new\nset of accounts, and for months her supervisor has been shuffling his own\nwork onto Loren\u2019s desk, giving her unrealistic deadlines and blaming her for\nworking too slowly. Today her supervisor goes home an hour early. She stays\ntwo hours late.\nWhen she gets home, her husband and her two daughters, ages nine and\n13, are eating dinner. Pizza, for the third time this week. She actually enjoys\nmaking dinner for everybody , she enjoys the bustle and catching up with the\nkids while she cooks, but it hasn\u2019t been possible this week, and her\nhusband\u2019s strategy is to do the bare minimum. She always asks him to make a\nsalad at least. He hasn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t mention it.\nExhausted, her mind spinning, and still in her work clothes, she sits down\nwith them to get in a few minutes of family time.\nHer daughters talk about school for a while; she barely hears them. Her\nhusband is scrolling on his phone. She\u2019s talked to him before about her\nlooking for a new job\u2014h e\u2019s for it\u2014bu t nothing has changed since then, and\nshe doesn\u2019t have the energy to rehash that conversation tonight. She\u2019s thinking\nabout everything left undone at work and how she\u2019ll probably have to stay\nlate tomorrow. Her oldest daughter asks if Loren can drive her to\nMinneapolis this weekend to shop for\u2026 Loren cuts her off\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s talk\nabout that on Friday,\u201d she says, \u201cwhen my brain is working again.\u201d After the\npizza is gone, everybody  leaves the table. She didn\u2019t even get a slice. She\neats some leftover crust and makes a bowl of soup for herself. It\u2019s been a day\nmuch like any other day. Tomorrow the process will start over.\nIt makes sense that we think of our work lives and our real lives as\nseparate things. Like Loren, many of us feel that the two things exist in\nentirely different spheres of experience. We work in order to live. Even those\nof us who are fortunate to be able to do work that we\u2019re passionate about\noften think of the two spheres as separate, and we struggle to find the right\nbalance between work and life.\nBut are we missing something here? Is the separation we perceive\nbetween work and life helping or hindering us in our quest for the good life?\nWhat if the value of work\u2014even work we dislike\u2014lies not just in getting\npaid, but also in the moment-to-moment sensations of being alive in the\nworkplace, and the feeling of vitality we get from being connected to others?\nWhat if even the most ordinary workday presents real oppor tunities for\nimproving our lives and our sense of being connected to the broader world?\nThe next day Loren\u2019s coworker Javier seems stressed out. More than her,\neven. He sits at his desk with his headphones on, but she can hear him sighing\nto himself, and he keeps checking his phone. Loren and Javier aren\u2019t close,\nbut she asks if everything is okay.\nYesterday he was in a car accident. It was his fault. Everyone is fine, but\nhis car is in bad shape, and his insurance only covers liability. There\u2019s no\nway he can afford a new car, or even to fix this one, and the office is too far\naway to get there without a car. He\u2019d gotten a ride from his roommate today,\nwhich is not a permanent solution.\n\u201cDoes the car still drive?\u201d\n\u201cBarely\u2014I can\u2019t take it on the highway.\u201d\n\u201cMy husband is a body  mechanic and does rally racing stuff. If you can\nget it to my house, he\u2019ll knock it together for cheap, at least make it\ndrivable.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can afford it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be cheap or free if you don\u2019t care how it looks. You might have to\nbuy a couple parts and a case of beer. Trust me, this man could build a car\nout of a pile of garbage. Bring it over. He owes me.\u201d\nThey get to talking, really for the first time. They\u2019ve worked beside each\nother for months but assumed they had nothing in common. She\u2019s fifteen years\nolder, he\u2019s into video games, and mostly they\u2019ve kept to themselves. Loren\nmentions how slow her work is going. Javier is a regular in the online forums\nthat discuss the somewhat outdated software they are using. He asks what\nshe\u2019s having trouble with and immediately sees that a key part of her work\ncan be automated using the software.\n\u201cGive me a minute,\u201d he says, and sits down at her station. Ten minutes\nlater, the software is handling work that would have taken her hours. Loren\nalmost breaks into tears of relief.\nIt turns out they both have a complaint about the physical filing system,\nwhich is an entire wall of the office, and sometimes makes their work more\ndifficult. Javier says he recently worked in a similar office where they did\nthe filing differently.\nTogether they approach the boss and convince him that a change in the\nfiling could make a big difference in productivity. He agrees and tasks the\ntwo of them with developing a plan for how to make it happen without\ndisrupting everything. It will have to be done in stages, after regular hours,\nand it will be a lot of work. But if he okays the plan, they\u2019d get some\novertime.\nThe next day, when Loren comes into the office, a paper sack is on her\ndesk. It\u2019s a loaf of sourdough bread. Javier has a family starter that\u2019s\ngenerations old. She\u2019s shocked that this young kid bakes his own bread.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more where that came from,\u201d he says.\nThat night Loren ends up working a bit late again, but not as late as she\nhas been, so she calls her husband and tells him to wait on dinner\u2014she\u2019ll be\nmaking BLTs with the sourdough.\nSeveral important things happened here. First, Loren turned a coworker\ninto an unlikely friend. The teamwork that flowed from that budding\nconnection, the shared experience, immediately diminished her level of\nstress. Now they were in the trenches together. She didn\u2019t just feel relief\nfrom receiving help, she felt relief from offering help.\nSecond, a meaningful project developed. This livened up the daily\nroutine, and the results of that project would make her own work life better\nand easier. She was now an active participant in her office environment,\nworking toward a small goal of her own design. The events that unfolded\nalso connected an achievement to a relationship. This is a crucial point.\nAchievement is most meaningful when it is relational. When what we do\nmatters to other people, it matters more to us. We might do something as a\nteam that gives us a sense of belonging, like Loren and Javier, or we might do\nsomething that directly benefits others; both are a kind of social benefit.\nThere\u2019s also the satisfaction we get from sharing our personal success with\nfriends and family: another benefit.\nFinally, Loren\u2019s growing friendship with Javier created the possibility\nthat her work could become a more meaningful piece of her life. The offer to\nenlist her husband\u2019s help and the gift of bread may seem like one-time\ngestures, but in fact, such gestures open an important door between two\nworlds\u2014a door that lets positive elements of life flow into work, and vice\nversa.\nWe rarely get to choose our coworkers. But while that might seem like a\ndownside of work, it also creates new oppor tunities for people who may\nnever have the oppor tunity to meet outside of work to forge unique\nrelationships and a type of understanding that wouldn\u2019t be possible\notherwise. Despite differences, coworkers like Javier and Loren can\nexperience a meeting of the minds.\nWORK VS. LIFE? OR JUST\u2026 LIFE?\nAll over the world, adults spend a major proportion of their lives\nworking. There are differences among countries because of economic,\ncultural, and other factors, but regardless of the country, work still accounts\nfor a significant piece of most people\u2019s waking hours.\nOn average, workers in the United Kingdom do not work the most hours\neach year (among sixty-six countries polled in 2017, that status belongs to\nCambodia) but they don\u2019t work the fewest hours, either (that status belongs to\nGermany), so individuals from the U.K. are good examples of the average\nworker. By the time the average individual in the U.K. reaches 80 years of\nage, he or she will have spent about 8,800 hours socializing with friends,\nabout 9,500 hours in activities with an intimate partner, and more than\n112,000 hour s (13 years!) at work. People in the United States apportion\ntheir time in similar ways. At any one time, 63 percent of all Americans age\n16 and over are part of the paid labor force, and there are many more who do\nimportant unpaid work like raising children and caregiving for loved ones.\nThat adds up to hundreds of millions of hours of work every day.\nWhen they reached their 70s and 80s, some Harvard Study participants\nexpressed regret about how much time they had spent at work. There\u2019s the\nold clich\u00e9 that on their deathbeds, no one ever wishes they\u2019d spent more time\nat the office. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 for a reason: it\u2019s often true:\nI wish I had spent more time with family. I worked a lot, just like\nmy father, who was a workaholic. Now I\u2019m worried my son is one, as\nwell.\nJames, age 81\nI wish I\u2019d spent a lot more time with my kids, and less time at\nwork.\nLydia, age 78\nI probabl y worked harder than I should have. I did good work,\nbut it took a lot from me. I didn\u2019t take vacations. I gave too much of\nmyself.\nGary, age 80\nThis is something many of us struggle with. We need to work and to\nprovide for our families, but work tends to pull us away from our families.\nYou might expect a book  like this to advoc ate leaning away from work to\nfocus more on family and relationships, and in many cases, working less\nmight be exactly what someone needs. But the complicated interplay among\nwork, leisure, relationships, home life, and well-being suggests more\nnuanced solutions. Our time at work affects our time at home, our time at\nhome affects our time at work, and it is our relationships in both places that\nform the foundation of that interplay. When there is an imbalance, the source\ncan sometimes be found in the way we have been attending to our\nrelationships on one side or the other.\nMichael Dawkins, a construction engineer and Study participant, had that\ncommon experience of regretting the amount of time he spent working,\ndespite the fact that he took great pride in his work and considered it the\ncentral purpose of his life. \u201cI love to create and learn new things and to see\nchanges in myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI find there\u2019s meaning in finishing projects, and\nbeing recognized for what I do. It gives me a good feeling.\u201d And yet, he\nlamented the way he spent his time at home, and the effects his commitment to\nwork had on his marriage. \u201cYou don\u2019t always notice what you\u2019ve missed,\u201d he\nsaid. \u201cEven when you\u2019re home, you\u2019re preoccupied. Then one day you turn\naround and realize it\u2019s too late.\u201d\nBut other participants, also dedicated to their work, were able to thrive\nin the midst of this complexity. Take Henry Keane. Though he never told the\nStudy much about the cars he made, he spoke often about how much he\nenjoyed the companionship he found at work; he thought of his workmates as\na second family. His wife, Rosa, who worked in the city payroll office for\nthirty years, felt the same way about the people she worked with, and the two\nof them often hosted huge barbecues for everyone they knew from both jobs.\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that at least one new happy couple didn\u2019t come from\nthose barbecues.\nOr take Leo DeMarco, our high school teacher, who rejected several\npromotions to administrative positions in order to continue his work as a\nteacher because his connections with students and other teachers gave him so\nmuch joy. His family often wished he\u2019d spent more time at home, but the time\nthey did spend together was valuable, and the strength of their connection\nundeniable.\nRebecca Taylor, one of the Student Council Study participants, had a\ndifferent and equally common experience of this complex interplay of work,\nhome, and relationships. At age 46, c ircumstances had backed Rebecca into a\ncorner, and she found herself struggling. Recently divorced after her husband\nabruptly abandoned the family, she was raising two children by herself and\nworking full-time as a nurse at a hospital in Illinois. Her son, 10, and\ndaughter, 15, were both devastated by their father\u2019s abandonment, and\nRebecca was doing her best to provide some stability in his absence. But\nbetween her efforts at home and her responsibilities at work, Rebecca was\nconstantly overwhelmed. It seemed she never had enough time.\n\u201cAnything I do, I try to do absolutely as well as I can,\u201d she told an\ninterviewer, two years after her husband left. \u201cBut right now it\u2019s just about\nkeeping my head above  water. I\u2019ve been taking additional classes three times\na week to get some additional certifications, so when I come home I only\nhave enough time to make dinner, do my reading, and maybe do some\nhousework before bed. I\u2019m too short with the kids. I know they feel how\nstressed I am and that doesn\u2019t help them. But the job defines my life right\nnow. It has to, we need it financially. It\u2019s not a dire circumstance, I don\u2019t\nwant to be too dramatic. But it\u2019s nonstop and the money is just barely enough.\nSometimes I just want to give up.\u201d\nBut Rebecca\u2019s kids were also there for her, and that gave her a modicum\nof strength in what felt like an impossible situation. \u201cSometimes I\u2019ll come\nhome and they\u2019ll have already done the laundry, and taken out the trash and\ngotten dinner started. They\u2019re both very active in that way. They know we\u2019re\nall in this together. It\u2019s such a relief that they feel that way, and it does make\nus closer. My son is only 10, so with everything going on he\u2019s still very\nattached to me. He follows me around when I get home and we catch up on\nthe day. He talks my ear off. I do my best to listen to him. Sometimes it\u2019s hard\nif I had a rough day.\u201d\nThe spillover effect that work has on our home lives is an especially\ncommon worry. We all have bad days at work. A disagreement with a\ncoworker, a lack of recognition of our contributions, feeling discounted at\nwork because of our gender or some other element of our identity,\nencountering demands that we can\u2019t possibly meet\u2014all kinds of things can\nlead to roiling emotions that we carry with us when we walk out of our\nworkplace to head home. Or, if our primary duties are at home with children,\nnegative emotions may linger after the kids are put to bed and our seemingly\nendless chores are ended for the day.\nWhat effect do these daily emotional currents that emerge from work\nhave on the other parts of our life? Our partners and families may have only\nthe barest ideas of what we\u2019re feeling when we leave work, but they are\noften the ones who bear the brunt of the emotion.\nCOMING HOME UPSET\nIn the 1990s , just as his relationship with his wife-to-be was getting\nserious, Marc began to worry about his own work-life balance. He was\nworking more than he ever had, and worried not only that he was losing time\nwith the people he cared about, but also that the time they did spend together\nwas affected by his emotions spilling over from work.\nInspired by these personal concerns\u2014as often happens in psychological\nresearch\u2014Marc began to use his time at work to investigate\u2026 time at work,\nand its connection to the rest of life. He conducted a study to try to quantify\nthe effects of a difficult workday on intimate relationships.\nCommitted couples with young children filled out questionnaires at the\nend of the workday and at bedtime over several days. The study was\ndesigned to shed some light on the question: When we come home upset, how\ndoes it affect our interactions with our intimate partners?\nThe findings wouldn\u2019t surprise many couples: rough workdays were\nlinked with changes in nightly interactions. For women, a difficult workday\nwas linked primarily with angrier behavior, and for men, primarily with\nwithdrawing emotionally from a partner.\nA number of the participants in the study, particularly the men, talked\nabout how they usually leave the stress of work at the workplace. But the\nstudy showed that even if we think we leave work at work, our emotions\ncarry over in ways that we may not always recognize. A curt reply to an\ninnocent question, zoning out in front of the TV or computer, a conversation\nabout someone else\u2019s problems that is shorter than it should be\u2014we might be\nsurprised how much our emotions from work can color our life at home.\nWhen our partners come home upset, however, we tend to place the blame on\nthe partners themselves with the familiar refrain, Don\u2019t take it out on m e!\nWhen feelings from work spill over into a close relationship, there is\nnothing to do but face those emotions. Some of the techniques we\u2019ve\ndiscussed in Chapter Six (regarding adaptation to emotion) and Chapter\nSeven (regarding intimacy) may be useful here. The cycle initiated by\ncoming-home-upset often goes something like this: One person comes home\nupset and is less engaged or patient with family members; that person\u2019s\npartner or children respond in a negative way to the altered behavior; this is\nfollowed by a negative response from whoever is upset; the evening goes\ndownhill.\nArresting this cycle is difficult, but it can be done, primarily by directly\naddressing the emotions involved. We feel what we feel, but we don\u2019t need\nto let emotions have their way with us. If we are the ones coming home upset,\nwe first have to recognize and accept that we are upset and acknowledge that\nthose feelings come from something that happened during the workday. Once\nwe acknowledge these facts, taking a few moments purposely to sit with the\nemotions\u2014in the parking lot outside work, during our commute, in the\nshower at home\u2014and allow ourselves to feel them without judgment, can,\ncounterintuitively, alleviate some of the hard edges. We don\u2019t need to rehash\nall the reasons for the emotions, all of the wrongs that have been perpetrated,\nand fall into a negative thought spiral. And the oppos ite tactic\u2014trying to\nignore the emotions or hide them from our partner\u2014often increases their\nintensity and our body \u2019s arousal. Instead, our most helpful first step is simply\nto recognize the feelings and acknowledge them to ourselves.\nConsider applying some of the lessons we talked about in Chapter Five\n(regarding paying attention) as well. When we come home upset, often the\nonly thing on our minds is work. But at that point, there is likely not much we\ncan do about whatever made us upset in the first place. To pull yourself out\nof an upsetting thought-spiral, try noticing your environment, its sounds, its\ntextures. Ask your spouse, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d and do your best to listen.\nReally listen. All of this is easier said than done, of course. It takes practice.\nIf it\u2019s your partner who\u2019s coming home upset, and you find yourself on the\nwrong end of irritability or inattentiveness, some similar strategies may help.\nIf you can keep yourself from immediately returning the negativity, take a step\nback and be curious about what may be going on for your partner. Take a\nbreath and again ask that simple question, \u201cHow was your day?\u201d Or change\nthe usual question to indicate that it\u2019s not just automatic: \u201cIt seems like you\nhad a hard day. Tell me about what happened.\u201d\nIt\u2019s inevitable that we will have hard days at work (or many of them in a\nrow). But can we do something about the reasons we\u2019re having those hard\ndays? Sometimes these difficult emotions stem from the nature of the work\nitself, but just as often they stem from the nature of our relationships at work,\nwhether it\u2019s a challenging coworker, a demanding boss, or customers who\nnever seem to be satisfied. Often, we think of these work relationships as set\nin stone. But they don\u2019t have to be. Many of the techniques we\u2019ve discussed\nthus far for family and intimate relationships can be applied to work\nrelationships as well. The W.I.S.E.R. model for difficult interactions from\nChapter Six can be very useful with workmates, too.\nIn the case of Victor Mourad, one of our inner-city Boston Study\nparticipants, the stress he experienced came not from difficult interactions at\nwork, not from a demanding boss, but from a problem that is endemic in the\nmodern workplace: a lack of meaningful interaction. In other words,\nworkdays full of loneliness.\nA DIFFERENT KIND OF POVERTY\nVictor grew up in the North End of Boston, the son of Syrian immigrants.\nHis was one of several Arabic-speaking families in the Study. The North End\nwas a heavily Italian neighborhood, a fact that often made Victor feel out of\nplace as a child. In every interview over the course of his life, he struck\nHarvard Study interviewers as both highly intelligent and chronically self-\nconscious. In fact, he believed that he was less intelligent than almost\neveryone he met. When he was a kid, if a fellow student played hooky or ran\naway from home, he believed it was because that student was too smart for\nschool, or more courageous than he was.\n\u201cVictor is a frank, open, and lovable boy who attends to everything\naround him,\u201d one of his junior high school teachers told the Study. \u201cBut he\u2019s a\nbundle of nerves.\u201d After Victor worked a number of odd jobs through his\n20s, his cousin started a small trucking company servicing New England and\noffered Victor a job. Victor declined, but after he married, and his cousin\u2019s\ncompany began to do well and expand to multiple locations, Victor\nreconsidered.\n\u201cI figured, well, I like to spend time alone. Driving a truck doesn\u2019t sound\nso bad,\u201d he said.\nAfter several years, Victor became a partner in the company, sharing in\nprofits while continuing to drive. He was proud that he made a decent living\nand maintained a high quality of life for his wife and kids, but that pride did\nnot mitigate his feelings of isolation. He would sometimes be away from\nhome for days at a time and didn\u2019t have any real friends that he interacted\nwith on a regular basis. The one person at work he knew well\u2014his cousin\u2014\nhad a short temper, and they often disagreed about how the company should\nbe run. Twenty years after he began the job, he told the Study that the money\nhe earned had prevented him from trying something else, but the job had\nbecome a real burden on his life. \u201cIf I had any guts I\u2019d quit,\u201d he told a Study\ninterviewer. \u201cBut a guy like me can\u2019t quit because of the economic bag I\u2019m\nin. I feel like I\u2019m on a treadmill to obl ivion.\u201d\nLike Victor, many of us don\u2019t always have a choice about the work we\ndo. Life circumstances and financial need can diminish our options, and it\u2019s\ncommon to find ourselves stuck in jobs that are not entirely satisfying. It\u2019s no\ncoincidence that many of the least satisfying jobs are also some of the\nloneliest. In the recent past, truck driving, night security, and certain kinds of\novernight shift work have been some of the more isolating jobs. Now\nisolating jobs are also common in emergent, tech-driven industries. People\nwho work for package- and food-delivery services, and other businesses in\nthe gig economy for example, often have no coworkers at all. Online retailing\nis now a vast industry with millions of workers, but even packing and sorting\nin a fulfillment warehouse, where there are plenty of coworkers, can be\nlonely. The work is so fast and furious and the warehouses so vast that many\nworkers on the same shift may not even know each other\u2019s names, and there\u2019s\nlittle oppor tunity for meaningful interaction.\nAnd of course, there is the foundational and age-old work of raising\nchildren; a job that can be as difficult and isolating as any other. Hours of no\nadult conversation, every day, can be mind-numbing.\nIf we feel disconnected from others at work, that means we feel lonely\nfor the majority of our waking hours. This is a health concern. As we\u2019ve\nmentioned elsewhere, loneliness increases our risk of death as much as\nsmoking or obesity. If we find ourselves feeling lonely at work, it may be up\nto us to create oppor tunities for social connection to the extent that we can.\nFor parents raising their kids at home, play dates or visits to a local park\n(which are often as much for the parents as for the kids) can be restorative.\nFor warehouse workers, there may be oppor tunities to connect with people\ndirectly before a shift, or directly after. For a gig worker, small interactions\nwith others can be oppor tunities for positive feelings and moments of relief\nfrom loneliness (in Chapter Ten, we\u2019ll talk more about the importance of\nthese \u201clesser\u201d interactions). If we want to maximize our well-being at work,\nwe may have to be thoughtful and intentional about it.\nHowever, loneliness at work does not afflict only those who work in\nsolitary jobs. Even busy people with extremely social jobs can feel\nincredibly lonely if they don\u2019t have meaningful connections with their\ncoworkers and colleagues.\nThe polling firm Gallup has conducted workplace engagement polls for\nthirty years, and one of their questions that has stimulated the most\ncontroversy is: Do you hav e a be st friend at  work?\nSome managers and employees find the question irrelevant or absurd, and\nin some workplaces, good friendships at work are looked at warily. If\nemployees are chitchatting and seem to be having a good time together, some\nthink that means they\u2019re not working and their productivity is probably\nsuffering.\nIn fact, the oppos ite is true. Research has shown that people who have a\nbest friend at work are more engage d than those who don\u2019t. The effect is\nespecially pronounced for women, who are twice as likely to be engaged in\ntheir jobs if they \u201cstrongly agree\u201d that they have a best friend at work.\nWhen we are searching for jobs, and looking at pay and health benefits,\nthe question of work relationships doesn\u2019t often appear. But these\nconnections are themselves a kind of work \u201cbenefit.\u201d Positive relationships\nat work lead to lower stress levels, healthier workers, and fewer days when\nwe come home upset. They also, simply, make us happier.\nUNLEVEL PLAYING FIELDS: INEQUITIES AT\nWORK AND HOME\nSeeking positive relationships at work comes with its own pitfalls,\nhowever, and workplaces have historically come with added burdens and\nchallenges for groups that have been marginalized by society. In the early\npart of the twentieth century in Boston, the marginalized included the\nimmigrants from poor areas in Europe and the greater Middle East who made\nup a large proportion of the inner-city sample. It also included the women\nwho were part of the Student Council Study, and today it includes women and\npeople of color who face continuing barriers at work. It\u2019s difficult to engage\nin authentic relationships when there are pervasive power imbalances and\nprejudices.\n\u201cI\u2019m worried right now,\u201d Rebecca Taylor, the Student Council Study\nparticipant mentioned earlier, told an interviewer in 1973, \u201cbecause the\nhospital is about to let several nurses go, and I could be one of them. I\noverheard a conversation the other day among several male doctors, all of\nthem agreeing that it was no big deal if they let any nurses go because they\nhad double incomes with their breadwinner husbands at home. I interrupted\nthem! I had to! I said, Come on guys! You have no idea what you\u2019re talking\nabout ! You act as if we have no respons ibilities at all, as if everyone\u2019s\nsituation is the same. That really infuriated me. This is the kind of thinking I\nhave to deal with, and for all I know the administrators agree. I could easily\nlose my job. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do then.\u201d\nAs a female psychologist in a field dominated by men, Mary Ainsworth\n(the creator of the Strange Situation procedure used to illuminate a child\u2019s\nattachment style that we discussed in Chapter Seven) had her own encounters\nwith sexism in the workplace. In the early 1960s , she and her other female\ncolleagues at Johns Hopkins University were forced to eat in a separate\nlunchroom from the men, and she did not receive compensation equal to that\nof her male counterparts. Earlier in her life she was told that she was not\nhired for a research position at Queen\u2019s University in Canada because she\nwas a woman. The field of psychology\u2014and even this book \u2014would look\nvery different if she hadn\u2019t managed to persevere.\nA lot of progress has been made on this front in many workplace cultures\naround the world, but inequities remain. In America, women\u2019s roles in the\nworkforce have changed significantly since the 1960s , with women working\na larger variety of jobs than ever before, and for more hours. But there has\nnot been a corresponding change in women\u2019s roles in the home. In her 1989\nbook , The Second Shift, Arlie Hochschild demonstrated that while there had\nbeen a revolution in women\u2019s roles in the workplace, women\u2019s\nresponsibilities at home remained largely the same, especially among\ncouples that have children.\nMore than thirty years later, these imbalances in family-rearing\nresponsibilities continue to endure and show up frequently in couples\ntherapy. Men often believe they are contributing equally at home (and\ncertainly doing more than their fathers ever did), when in many cases their\ncontributions of time to home care activities are less than they imagine. A\nwoman might cook dinner, a man might load the dishwasher; one takes an\nhour, the other takes a few minutes. A woman might help a child with\nhomework, a man will read the child a story before bed. One takes half an\nhour, the other fifteen minutes. Every relationship is different, but\nstatistically, the time burdens in the home still often weigh more heavily on\nthe woman.\nThe difficulty for women doesn\u2019t end when they leave the house. The Me\nToo movement has drawn needed attention to sexual abuse and harassment\nconnected to hierarchies and pow er imbalances in the workplace. But even at\na more innocuous level, when sex is not involved, cultivating authentic\nrelationships with others who are at different levels of authority is risky, and\nthis is true for both women and men. Power discrepancies have a tendency to\nskew and sometimes corrupt all sorts of relationships.\nEllen Freund, the wife of a First Generation study participant, worked in\nadmissions at a university, and she discovered the danger of power\nimbalances when a particular discrepancy poisoned some of her friendships\nat work. Asked in 2006 i f she had any regrets, she told the Study:\nI do have regrets, actually. It\u2019s been a few decades now but I\u2019ll tell\nyou about it. Several years after I started at the university I worked with\nfour or five ladies who were about my age. Technically they worked\nunder me, but we became good friends. We socialized all the time. The\nnew dean of admissions asked me to give him a confidential assessment\nof all the people on the staff\u2014their strengths and their weaknesses. I did\nthis and I was absolutely honest. The office manager thought that I was\ntraitorous. She copied the memorandum and put it on the desk of every\none of those ladies. I never thereafter developed a close relationship\nwith anyone that I worked with at the university. And that trails me to\nthis day. It ended my friendships with them. They were pretty good\nabout it. We never talked about it. They realized that what I said was\ntrue. I tried my best to be fair. It probably didn\u2019t hurt their standing\nbecause I said that. But it certainly destroyed my friendships with them.\nAsked if she had intentionally avoided forming relationships with others\nafter this incident, Ellen said, \u201cAbsolutely. I wanted to be free to deal with\npeople on as nearly pure a professional basis as I could. I didn\u2019t want to be\ninfluenced or perceived to be influenced by personal relationships.\u201d\nEllen chose to disengage from her relationships at work, to separate her\n\u201cpersonal relationships\u201d from what she considered her \u201cwork relationships.\u201d\nThis is a common and understandable strategy. If we minimize our social\nconnections and minimize the degree to which we open ourselves up to our\nworkmates, it will minimize a certain kind of trouble at work. But it can\npotentially open up new avenues of trouble\u2014including feelings of\ndisconnection and loneliness. In Ellen\u2019s case, this decision defined her life at\nwork for the duration of her career, and she eventually came to regret it.\nWhat might she have done instead? Facing toward the difficulty\u2014talking\nwith each of her colleagues to see if hurt feelings could be eased\u2014m ight\nhave allowed her to hold on to at least some of the relationships that she so\nvalued.\nThese decisions impact the workplace in more ways than one. Not only\ncan disengagement diminish the quality of our time at work, but it can also\nhinder the transfer of knowledge and stall workers\u2019 growth, particularly the\ngrowth of younger workers. One of the most valuable types of relationships\nat work is also one that comes with a power imbalance: that of mentor and\nmentee.\nMENTORSHIP AND THE ART OF\nGENERATIVITY\nWhen our high school teacher Leo DeMarco was young, he dreamed of\nbecoming a fiction writer. But in the end, that dream gave way to his\nenthusiasm for teaching, and he found meaning in helping his students pursue\ntheir dreams of writing. \u201cEncouraging others,\u201d he said, \u201cwas more important\nthan doing it myself.\u201d\nLeo, like all teachers, was in a unique position in that it was his job\nspecifically to be a mentor to his students. But in any profession there are\nthose who are just getting started, and those who\u2019ve been there a long time. A\nmentorship relationship can be beneficial for both the mentor and the mentee.\nAs mentors, we get to be generative. It\u2019s a very particular joy to be able to\nextend our influence and wisdom beyond ourselves and into the next\ngeneration. We get to pay forward benefits given to us in our own careers\u2014\nor benefits that we\u2019d always wished had been given to us. We also get to\nenjoy the energy and optimism of people who are at earlier points in their\ncareer paths, and to be exposed to fresh ideas that younger people often\nbring. As mentees, on the other hand, we are able to grow our skills and\nadvance in a career more quickly than if we had to learn everything by\nourselves. Some jobs, in fact, require this kind of relationship. There are\nmany jobs in which it is not even possible to learn without some kind of\ninstruction and a close apprenticeship with a more experienced person.\nEmbracing these relationships and cultivating them can make for a much\nricher experience for everyone involved.\nBob and Marc have benefited from a number of mentors who have\nshaped our personal careers, and for that matter, our lives. In fact, at different\ntimes, we\u2019ve provided mentorship to each other.\nWhen we first met, Bob was officially Marc\u2019s boss, as Bob was the\ndirector of the program where Marc was doing his psychology internship.\nMarc was more than a decade younger than Bob but more advanced in his\nresearch training. Soon after they met, Bob decided to apply for a grant that\nwould allow him to pursue research himself. He had an established career as\na clinical psychiatrist and educator; doing research would mean leaving his\nadministrative position, and starting from square one. Some of his colleagues\ncounseled against it, saying it was too late, and the transition would be too\ndifficult. Bob went ahead anyway. But he had a problem; a significant part of\nthe grant application included complicated statistical analyses, which were\nas foreign to Bob as ancient Greek. So he offered Marc both his friendship\nand a lifetime supply of chocolate chip cookies in exchange for Marc\u2019s\nguidance.\nIt was a complex relationship: Bob was Marc\u2019s boss and had to accept a\ncertain amount of vulnerability in order to ask for help. Marc also was\nvulnerable, since Bob was substantially senior and had much more security.\nBut we learned from each other. In one direction flowed statistical\nknowledge, and in the other, a wealth of experience. In the end, Bob got the\ngrant, and made the transition to research (though Marc hasn\u2019t seen a cookie\nfrom Bob in many years).\nAs we grow older, and transition from being mentees to being mentors,\nfrom students to teachers, new opportunities for connection arise, and those\noppor tunities can come from surprising places. Mentoring younger\ngenerations, and sharing wisdom and experience with others, is part of the\nnatural flow of work life, and can make almost any kind of job more\nrewarding. The satisfaction that comes from being generative makes the good\nlife at work more possible.\nWORK TRANSITIONS\nAs we progress through the stages of our lives there are transitions that\nwill occur in our work as well, whether it be when we receive promotions,\nget laid off, move into new jobs, or have kids. With each major transition it\nnever hurts to step back and reassess our new lives from a bird\u2019s-eye view:\nHow are my relationships in the work world and beyond being affected by\nthe current change ? Are there choices I can make to maintain conne ctions\nwith people who are important to me? Are there new oppor tunities for\nconne ction he re that I\u2019m missing?\nOne of the most impactful transitions around work is also one of the last:\nretirement. This is a complicated transition and one filled with relational\nchallenges. The \u201cideal\u201d retirement\u2014in which a worker puts in the required\nyears on the same job, retires with a full pension, and then lives a life of\nleisure\u2014has never been that common (and in the modern age is all but\nextinct).\nThe Harvard Study asked participants often about retirement. A good\nnumber of the men in the study were adamant that their life was too tied up\nwith work to consider the possibility. \u201cI\u2019ll never retire!\u201d they said. Some\ndidn\u2019t want to retire, others didn\u2019t feel financially able to retire, and some\nwere just struggling to imagine a life without work. Some participants\u2019 work\nstatus was very difficult to pin down. Many refused to think about it, left\nretirement questions blank when they filled out Study questionnaires, or\nindicated that they were retired despite the fact that they were continuing to\nwork almost full-time; for them, it seemed, retirement was just a state of\nmind.\nWhen we retire, it can be a challenge to find new sources of meaning and\npurpose, but doing so is crucial. Those who fare the best in retirement find\nways to replace the social connections that sustained them for so long at\nwork with new \u201cmates.\u201d Even if we didn\u2019t enjoy working and were doing it\nonly to support ourselves and our family, removing this major organizer of\nour days can leave an enormous hole in our social lives.\nOne participant, when asked what he missed about the work he did in his\nmedical practice, which he operated for nearly fifty years, answered,\n\u201cAbsolutely nothing [about the work itself]. I miss the people and the\nfriendship.\u201d\nLeo DeMarco had a similar feeling. Just after he retired, a Study\ninterviewer visited him at his home and wrote this in his field notes:\nI asked Leo what was most difficult about retirement and he said\nthat he missed his colleagues and said that he tried to stay in touch with\nthem. \u201cI get spiritual sustenance from talking shop.\u201d He said he still\nenjoyed talking about what the task of teaching young people was all\nabout. \u201cIt is wonderful to help someone acquire skills.\u201d He then told\nme, \u201cteaching is an almost total human commitment.\u201d He said that\nteaching young people \u201cstarted the whole process of exploring.\u201d He\nsaid that small children know how to play and \u201cthe adult in education\nhas to remember how to do that.\u201d He said it was hard for adolescents\nand adults to remember how to play because of the other \u201ccommitments\u201d\nin their lives.\nLeo was early in his retirement when he said this, and still trying to\nunderstand what it meant for him no longer to be teaching. He was looking\nback on his career, thinking about how it affected him and what it was he was\nmissing, exactly. His comment about adults remembering how to play was\nsomething he himself was grappling with; now that work was no longer the\ncenter of his life, play could again become important.\nFor many of us, at a deeper emotional level, work is where we feel that\nwe matter\u2014to our workmates, to our customers, and even to our families\u2014\nbecause we are providing for them. When that sense of mattering is gone, we\nhave to find new ways to matter to others. New ways to be part of something\nbigger than ourselves.\nHenry Keane is a representative case. He was abruptly forced into\nretirement by changes at his factory. Suddenly he found himself with an\nabundance of time and energy, so he looked for some volunteer oppor tunities\nwhere he felt he could be helpful. First he began working at a nursing home\nrun by Veterans Affairs, and then he started participating in the American\nLegion and Veterans of Foreign Wars. He was also able to put more time into\nhis hobbies, refinishing furniture and cross-country skiing. But even with all\nof that, it didn\u2019t feel like enough. Something was missing.\n\u201cI need to work!\u201d he told the Study at age 65. \u201cNothing too substantial but\nI\u2019m hoping to find some jobs that will keep me busy and add to my income.\nI\u2019m realizing that I just love to work and to be around people.\u201d\nIt wasn\u2019t so much that Henry needed the money\u2014he had a decent pension\nand was happy with that income\u2014it was that earning money would somehow\nmake his activities feel like they mattered; someone was paying him for them.\nEach person must find their own way of mattering to others.\nHenry\u2019s realization about wanting to be around people also teaches us an\nimportant lesson\u2014not about retirement, but about work itself: the people we\nwork with matter. It\u2019s important to look around our workplaces and\nappreciate those coworkers who add value to our lives. Since work is often\nso shrouded in financial concerns, in stress and worry, the relationships we\ndevelop there sometimes don\u2019t get their due. We often don\u2019t notice how\nsignificant our work relationships really are until they\u2019re gone.\nTHE EVOLVING NATURE OF WORK\nOn the northeast outskirts of Philadelphia, not far from where Marc lives,\nis a large plot of a land that used to be a family farm. People who lived near\nthe farm could drive by in the morning and see green pastures, with cattle\ngrazing. When World War II began the farm was sold to the U.S. government\nand converted into an enormous industrial complex for producing artillery\nshells and prototype planes. The view changed to buildings and runways,\nwith trucks and planes taxiing. After the war, various types of manufacturing\ncontinued on the site until the late 1990s , when it was sold and transformed\ninto a golf course. Homes were built around the course, and people could\nlook out their windows and see trees and fairways and motoring golf carts\ninstead of an industrial park. Now, thirty years later, after further changes in\nthe economy, the golf course was sold, and as this book  is being written a\nlarge portion of the land is now being converted into a UPS sorting center.\nSoon, when the people who live nearby look out their windows, the fairways\nand golf carts will have been replaced by a vast warehouse and delivery\nvehicles. This area is not unique; all over the country, in every sector of the\neconomy, we are witnessing these evolutions.\nOur inner-city Boston participants\u2019 most formative years, from when they\nwere toddlers until they reached their preteen years, occurred during the\nGreat Depression. Growing up at a time when they couldn\u2019t take financial\nsecurity for granted shaped how they would go on to conduct their work\nlives. For them, work was often less about creating a good life, and more\nabout staving off disaster.\nThe economic trials that those participants experienced are relevant\ntoday, when we face economic, environmental, and technological challenges\nthat are causing uncertainty for the foreseeable future. The uncertainty that\nHenry Keane or Wes Travers would have felt when standing in a Depression-\nera breadline is directly related to the uncertainty that a Gen Z child might\nhave felt when watching her family evicted from her childhood home during\nthe 2008 financial crisis, or that young people face as we emerge from the\nCovid-19 pa ndemic.\nDespite technological advances, there are still plenty of people working\ngrueling jobs, people still struggling to meet their basic needs. The idealized\nprosperity that many expected to arrive with the computer and the\ninformation age has been limited to certain sectors and people, leaving others\nworse off than before. New technologies are changing how often we interact\nwith others at work. Artificial intelligence is replacing some jobs and people\nwith automated systems, creating more interaction with machines and less\nwith human beings. Advances in communication technologies are making\nremote work much more common for jobs in business, media, education, and\nother industries, and an always-on mentality threatens to make workers\u2019\nhome lives into an extension of the work sphere. To say the least, a\nconsideration of how these changes have affected our social fitness has not\nbeen a top priority. And yet the state of our relationships is among the most\nimportant factors in our health and well-being.\nIn Chapter Five we encouraged you to remember that the time each of us\nhas left is both a finite resource and an unknown quantity. If we want to take\nfull advantage of the hours of our lives\u2014many of which are spent at work\u2014\nwe must remember that work is a major source of socializing and\nconne ction. C hange  the nature of work, and y ou change  the nature of life.\nThe Covid pandemic could not have made this clearer. Millions of\npeople who were locked down in their homes and laid off, furloughed, or\nforced to work remotely, quickly found themselves missing the connections\nthey were used to having every day. We became isolated from our\nworkmates, customers, and colleagues. Bob and Marc, for example, began\nusing remote tools to teach, work with colleagues, and even to see people in\ntherapy. That took some getting used to. It was better than nothing, but it was\nnot the same as before.\nMore technological development is inevitable. Because of the economic\nadvantages (the lower cost of not maintaining an office), and advantages of\nflexible schedules and reduced commutes for employees, more jobs will\nundoubtedly include remote or partly remote options. This might make sense\nfinancially and for certain logistical reasons, but how will it affect the well-\nbeing of workers?\nThe oppor tunity to work remotely can have positive effects. It allows\nsome workers greater flexibility and more contact with their families. It\u2019s\nespecially favorable for working parents who would like to spend more time\nat home, or who don\u2019t have access to or can\u2019t afford child care, and to those\nwho have expensive or onerous commutes to work.\nBut there is a flip side to that coin, as well. Working from home detaches\nus from important social contact in the workplace. We may feel an initial\nliberation, and love the new convenience, but as we discussed in Chapter\nFive, the losses we experience from new technological advances are often\nveiled by the gains, and these losses are potentially profound. More research\nis needed, but the loss of in-person contact as we move as much work as\npossible into the home may have a significant impact on the mental health and\nwell-being of workers. While parents who work from home might get some\nbenefits from being more available to their families, doing so can also place\na greater burden on them, forcing them to work and care for children at the\nsame time. And it\u2019s likely that this burden will fall harder on working\nmothers and those with fewer resources for supplemental child care.\nAs we confront these changes, we can and should ask ourselves the\nquestion: How are these technological changes in the workplace affecting our\nsocial fitness? If automation means we are interacting more with machines\nand less with people, is there a way to cultivate new social environments at\nwork? If more of us are going to be working remotely, how can we replace\nthe in-person contact we used to get at work?\nOur brains, tuned for novelty and danger, catch fire when stimulated by\nthe wonders of new technology and the stresses of the workplace. Compared\nto those two things, the subtle currents of our positive relationships, so\nimportant to our well-being, are likely to be overshadowed. If our\nrelationships\u2014bot h at work and at home\u2014are going to thrive in this new\nwork environment, we have to elevate and care for them. We are the only\nones who can. If we don\u2019t, and if the Harvard Study still exists in eighty\nyears, then when today\u2019s youngest generation reaches their 80s and the\ninterviewers ask if there was anything they regret about their lives, they might\nlook back, as some of our First Generation participants did in their comments\nquoted earlier in this chapter, and realize that something crucial has been\nlost.\nMAKING THE MOST OF YOUR WORK HOURS\nWe often think we have plenty of time to make changes, plenty of time to\nfigure out how to improve our life at work or to balance our work and home\nlife\u2014If I can only get through this current difficulty, this current issue, I\u2019ll\nhave time to think about  that; there\u2019s always tomorrow\u2014bu t five or ten\nyears can pass in no time. We conducted personal interviews with Harvard\nStudy participants every ten to twenty years. That seems like a long time, but\nwhenever we requested a new interview, participants often said something\nlike, Has it been that long already? It seemed to them that a decade had\npassed in the blink of an eye.\nIn Chapter Five we talked about the common illusion that there will\nalways be time for the things we need to do, and how in reality we only have\nthe present moment. If we are always imagining that there will be time later,\none day we\u2019ll look around and realize there is no more later. Most of our\nnows will have passed.\nSo tomorrow when you get up and go to work, consider a few questions:\n \nWho are the people I most enjoy and value at work, and what is it about\nthem that is valuable? Am I appreciating them?\nWho is different from me in some way (who thinks differently, comes\nfrom a different background, has different expertise), and what can I\nlearn from that person?\nIf I\u2019m having a conflict with another worker, what can I do to alleviate\nit? Would the W.I.S.E.R. model be useful?\nWhat kinds of connections am I missing at work that I might want more\nof? Could I imagine a way to make these connections more likely, or\nricher?\nDo I really know my workmates? Is there someone I\u2019d like to know\nbetter? How can I reach out to them? You might even pick that person\nwith whom you seem to have the least in common, and make a point to\nbe curious and ask about something that they\u2019ve displayed, like pictures\nof family or pets or a T-shirt they wear at work.\nThen, when you head home, consider how you feel and how the\nexperiences of the workday might influence your time at home. It could be\nthat this influence is, on balance, a good one. But if not, are there small,\nreasonable changes that can be made? Would ten minutes or half an hour to\nyourself help, or a short walk or swim before you get home from work?\nWould it help to turn your smartphone off for a specific period of time to\nkeep work from spilling into family time?\nSometimes we\u2019d rather be doing anything other than working. But these\nhours are a major social oppor tunity. Many of the happiest men and women\nin the Harvard Study had positive relationships with their work and their\nworkmates, whether they were selling tires or teaching kindergarten or\nperforming surgery, and they were able to balance (often after much difficulty\nand negotiation) their work lives with their home lives. They understood it\nwas all of a piece.\n\u201cWhen I look back on my work life,\u201d Ellen Freund, the university\nadministrator, told the Study in 2006, \u201cI sometimes wish I had paid more\nattention to the people who had worked for me or around me and less to the\nproblem at hand. I loved my work. I really did. But I think I was a difficult\nand impatient and demanding boss. I guess I sort of wish\u2014now that you\nmention it\u2014that I had known everyone a little better.\u201d\nOur life doesn\u2019t wait at the door when we walk into work. It doesn\u2019t\nstand on the side of the road when we climb into the seat of our truck. It\ndoesn\u2019t peer through the classroom window as we meet with our students on\nthe first day of class. Every workday is an important personal experience,\nand to the extent we can enrich each one with relationships, we benefit.\nWork, too, is life.\n  10  \nALL FRIENDS HAVE BENEFITS\nMy friends are my \u201cestate.\u201d Forgive me then the avarice to hoard\nthem.\nEmily Dickinson\nAnanda, one of the Buddha\u2019s disciples, said to the Buddha one day,\n\u201cI\u2019ve realized that half of the path to the holy life is made of good\nfriendships.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Ananda,\u201d the Buddha said. \u201cFriends are not half of the holy\nlife. They are all of the holy life.\u201d\nUpaddha Suta\nWithout friends, no one would choose to live.\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1989:\nQ: Consider your 10 best friends (excluding family and close relatives). How many of them\nwould you place in each of the following categories?\n(1) Intimate; we share most of our joys and sorrows;\n(2) Companionship; we have frequent interactions arising out of shared interests;\n(3) Casual; we don\u2019t seek each other out.\nWhen Louie Daly was in his 50s, a Study interviewer asked him about\nhis oldest friend. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have any friends,\u201d he said. \u201cThe closest\nfriend I ever had was a guy named Morris Newman, we were roommates in\nmy freshman year of college. It was Mo that introduced me to jazz music,\nwhich I\u2019m passionate about now. We were extremely close for a year until he\nflunked out. We wrote back and forth for about ten years after that. Then he\nstoppe d writing. Five years ago I thought I missed Mo, so I paid $500 to a\nsearch agency to find him. They did actually find him, and we started\ncorresponding again. Then one day about three months later I went out to the\nbox and there was a letter there but it wasn\u2019t from Mo. It was from his\nattorney telling me that Mo had suddenly passed away.\u201d\nAsked who he would call now if he had a problem, Louie said, \u201cI\u2019m a\nvery self-sufficient person. I don\u2019t need people as much.\u201d\nLeo DeMarco reported a different experience. When asked by an\ninterviewer if he had a best friend, Leo said without hesitation, \u201cEthan\nCecil.\u201d They\u2019d known each other since grade school and were still close.\nEthan lived a couple of hours away and would drive over now and then, plop\nhimself down, and just start talking. While Leo was discussing this\nfriendship, the phone rang, and Leo spoke with the caller in a very animated\nvoice. When he hung up, he said, \u201cThat was Ethan.\u201d\nWhat does it mean, in our adult lives, to have a friend? What does it\nmean to be a friend? How important are friendships in our lives, really?\nWhen we\u2019re kids, friendships are often central, in part because they have\nsuch an intense quality to them. The strength of connection between two\nfriends in childhood (or even in young adulthood) is rivaled only by the\nintensity of the hurt if the friendship goes wrong. If we feel loved, our hearts\nsoar with a sense of belonging, and if we feel wronged or if we\u2019re bullied,\nthose wounds cut deep.\nWe change as we grow older, and as a consequence our connections to\nfriends change. Friendships that were central during young adulthood may\nwither away in the early years of a marriage or when children are born, but\nthen go through a resurgence during a difficult period in a marriage, or after\nthe death of a loved one.\nAll of this is natural. But along with the natural ebb and flow of life, each\nof us has a habitual approach to friendships. Often this approach is less than\nconscious, close to automatic. We give our friendships whatever feels natural\nto give them, rather than considering what they need. As we get older and life\nbecomes busier, we have to make decisions about the limited time we have,\nand our friends often come last. Responsibilities to family and work may be\nprioritized over a phone call to an old friend or a coffee with a new friend or\na regular card game or a monthly book  club (we recommend The Good L ife).\nSure, it\u2019s fun to go out and have a good time with friends, we might think as\nwe\u2019re deciding where our time should go, but I just have more important\nthings to do.  Or we might think, My friendships will always be there\u2014I can\npick them up again when the kids are older\u2026 when work slows down\u2026\nwhen I have some extra time.\nThe truth is, our friends are much more important to our health and well-\nbeing as adults than we give them credit for. It\u2019s amazing, in fact, how\npowerful the effects of friendships can be on our adult lives, considering the\namount of attention they get. Friends can pick us up when we\u2019re down,\nprovide an important connection to our own history, and perhaps most\nimportantly make us laugh; sometimes nothing is as beneficial to our health as\na good t ime.\nFor centuries, philosophers have observed the profound effects of\nfriendship. The Roman philosopher Seneca wrote that the value of friends\nreaches far beyond what they can do for us. We don\u2019t keep friends just to\nhave someone who can sit by our bedside when we\u2019re sick, or to come to our\nrescue when we\u2019re in trouble. \u201cAnyone thinking of his own interests and\nseeking out friendship with this in view is making a great mistake,\u201d Seneca\nwrote. \u201cWhat is my object in making a friend? To have someone to be able to\ndie for, someone I may follow into exile.\u201d\nSeneca was speaking to the fact that the benefits of friendships are\nsometimes obscure and not easily observed. Perhaps because of this, these\nrelationships are often neglected. Good friendships don\u2019t always call out to\nus or stick themselves under our noses, waiting for attention. Sometimes, they\njust quietly step into the background of our lives and slowly fade away.\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be like this. If we look more carefully, we might find\nthat we\u2019ve been failing to notice straightforward, potentially fun\noppor tunities to pay attention to friends and awaken our social universe\u2014\noppor tunities that are hiding in plain sight and that could profoundly improve\nthe quality of our lives. Friendships may not require our care, but they can\u2019t\ncare for themselves.\nGOOD COMPANY ON A DIFFICULT PATH\nThirty years ago, when Bob and Marc first met, our connection was\nprimarily professional. Once a week, we\u2019d get lunch and talk about things\nlike statistical models, research methods, and study design. Even though the\nconversations were mostly about professional matters (and the occasional\nfocus on office politics and other gossipy topics), each of us had a growing\nsense that the other was a person we wanted to know better. So, even when\nwe had no pressing business, we kept meeting for lunch every week at the\nsame time. And of course, we found more and more to talk about\u2014ou r\nfamilies, our hobbies, childhood m emories.\nAt one point, we propos ed getting together with our wives for a dinner.\nLuckily Bob\u2019s wife, Jennifer, and Marc\u2019s wife, Joan, found that they enjoyed\neach other\u2019s company. Joan and Jennifer had to sit through occasional\nconversations about statistical analysis, but they accepted that burden and in\na relatively short time the four of us had become good\u2014i f not yet close\u2014\nfriends. At one point, after a couple of months without a dinner, Bob and\nJennifer invited Marc and Joan over. Joan was pregnant for the first time, the\ndue date was just over a month away, and she and Marc were nervously\nanticipating the birth. Bob and Jennifer already had two young sons of their\nown, so Marc and Joan were looking forward to getting some reassurance\nand advice about what to expect.\nBut at the end of a workday on the Thursday before the scheduled dinner,\nMarc got a frantic call from Joan. During a routine check-up, the doctor told\nher she needed to go to the hospital immediately for an emergency C-section.\nMarc ran out of work, almost crashing into Bob on  the way.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Joan and the baby,\u201d Marc said. \u201cShe\u2019s in an ambulance on her way\nto the hospital.\u201d\nWhen Marc arrived, Joan was being connected to monitors and writhing\nin agony. The doctors explained that she had a life-threatening form of\npreeclampsia. Her liver was showing signs of failure, her blood pressure,\nvisible on a monitor behind her, was skyrocketing, and she kept asking Marc\nand the nurses for reassurance that it was beginning to come down. Marc and\nJoan both remember the doctors saying that Joan and the baby would likely\ndie if the C-section wasn\u2019t performed right way.\nAs they prepped Joan for surgery, Marc called Bob to give him a quick\nupdate. Bob let Marc know that he was available at any time to come to the\nhospital to keep Marc company. The events unfolded too quickly that evening\nfor Bob to make it to the hospital, but in the midst of the most visceral worry\nMarc had ever experienced, Bob\u2019s offer of help was incredibly powerful and\nreassuring. Both Marc and Joan\u2019s families were too far away to make it in\ntime, and a comforting friend was sorely needed.\nThe C-section went smoothly, and Marc was there with Joan to witness\nthe birth of their son and to share in the relief as Joan\u2019s blood pressure began\nto return to normal. They both rejoiced as their son let out his first cry\u2014\nreally more of a squeak. Born a month early, he was small as a bird\n(weighing in at four and a half pounds), but otherwise healthy. Joan and Marc\nwere so tired that they could not even decide on the baby\u2019s name. Marc gave\nBob the update and told him they were going to try to get some sleep.\nThe next day, Bob canceled his commitments and came to visit Joan,\nMarc, and the newly named Jacob in the hospital.\nJoan\u2019s recovery was a slow one, but after five long days they left for\nhome. Marc and Joan have a video of Joan shuffling out of the hospital and\nJacob fidgeting in a car seat for his departure. It\u2019s not the best quality video\n\u2014it\u2019s a little bouncy\u2014bu t then Bob isn\u2019t the best videographer.\nThose days were such a blur for Marc that it wasn\u2019t until much later that\nhe thought back on them and realized that having Bob close by, even though\nthere was nothing Bob could do to help Joan, made a real difference. It also\nshowed Marc that their friendship wasn\u2019t just about statistics and research\nand some good times during a few dinner dates. Bob was there for him and\nJoan when it really mattered. And he knew that when the time came, he\nwould be there for Bob, too.\nThis is just one of many stories in the life of our friendship; the friendship\nthat has now, twenty-six years later, brought you this book . When you think of\nthe more difficult times of your life, you may have similar stories that come\nto mind. When adversity strikes\u2014and it eventually does\u2014it is often our\nfriends who help us through, who buffer us against the wild weather of life.\nThe power of friendship isn\u2019t just the stuff of anecdotes or philosophical\nobservation; science has clearly shown this effect. Friends diminish our\nperception of hardship\u2014m aking us perceive adverse events as less stressful\nthan we might otherwise see them\u2014and even when we do experience\nextreme stress, friends can diminish its impact and duration. We feel the\nstress, but with the help of friends we\u2019re better able to manage it. Less stress\nand better stress management lead to less wear and tear on our bodi es.\nFriends, in short, keep us healthier.\nIn Chapter Two we discussed a 2010 r eview conducted by Julianne Holt-\nLunstad and others that brought together 148 studies and a vast amount of\ndata to analyze the effect that social connections have on health and\nlongevity. Among those 148 studies were a number that focused specifically\non friendship. Here are a few that make the point:\n \nA large longitudinal study in Australia found that people over 70 with\nthe strongest network of friends were 22 percent less likely to die\nduring the study period (ten years) than those with the weakest network\nof friends\nA longitudinal study of 2,835 nurses with breast cancer found that\nwomen who had ten or more friends were four times more likely to\nsurvive than women who had no close friends.\nA longitudinal study of over 17,000 men and women between the ages\nof 29 and 74 in Sweden found that stronger social connections\ndecreased the risk of dying from all causes by almost a fourth over a\nperiod of  six years.\nThe list goes on. When we increase our connection to friends, it has a\nmeasurable effect on our bodies because our bodies need what friendships\nprovide. The human need for friends and the coope ration that comes with\nthem is an important evolutionary piece of what has made human beings a\nsuccessful species. Having friends, having a group that we belong to, has\nalways made survival in dangerous environments more likely, and friends\nalso protect our health in stressful modern environments. No matter how\nstrong we are, how independent we are, how self-sufficient we are, we are\nstill biologically tuned for friendship. When the going gets tough, even the\ntough benefit from having friends.\nA TROVE OF HARD TIMES\nIn some ways, the Harvard Study is uniquely positioned to investigate the\nconnection between friendship and adversity, because it is a trove of hard\ntimes. All of our First Generation participants lived through the Great\nDepression. Almost all of the Boston inner-city cohort came from humble (to\nsay the least) and sometimes tragic beginnings, and a number of the Harvard\nCollege cohort grew up in challenging economic or social circumstances. In\nthe college cohort, 89 percent fought in World War II, as we have mentioned,\nand about half of those were involved in combat. Many of the inner-city\nparticipants, who were a few years younger, fought in the Korean War. Some\nof the Study participants faced situations in which they had to kill or be\nkilled, and some witnessed their friends being killed. Some came home with\nwhat has since been recognized as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nWhat role did friendships play amid these challenges? Do their\nexperiences have any lessons for us?\nThey do. Using participants\u2019 firsthand accounts of their combat\nexperiences and their connections to fellow servicemen, we found that those\nmen who had more positive friendships with their fellow servicemen, and\nwho served in combat units that were more cohesive and connected, were\nless likely to experience symptoms of PTSD after the war. Their friendships,\nin other words, were like a kind of protective armor. Having good and\ntrusted friends buffered these men during some of the most difficult events of\ntheir lives.\nSome of those relationships endured. One of the questions we asked\nparticipants was about their later-life contact with the friends they made\nduring the war. Some still exchanged Christmas cards with their fellow\nservicemen, still spoke on the phone with them occasionally, and even\ncontinued to travel to visit them right up to the very end of their lives. Some\neven reported keeping in touch with the spouses of their military comrades.\nMost, however, lost contact with those comrades, just as they\u2019d lost\ncontact with other friends. As their lives went on, challenges kept coming,\nbut they had to weather them without the support of close friends. Like Neal\nMcCarthy (Chapter Eight), there are participants in the Study who served in\nwar, saw combat, but told us that their most difficult experiences occurred\nduring their civilian lives. Divorces, accidents, the deaths of spouses or of\nchildren, and other kinds of intense, stressful experiences weighed on them.\nBut as they aged, their attention to friendships often waned, until they found\nthemselves facing stressful experiences without the support of friends. Unlike\nwhen they were in combat, they had no peers to turn to or to share their\nhardships with. No one to help them through.\nWITHERING FRIENDSHIPS\nLooking through the files of the Study, it doesn\u2019t take long to find men\nwho, in their later years, regretted the way their friendships turned out. These\ninclude the cases of extreme isolation and loneliness like Sterling Ainsley\n(Chapter Four) or Victor Mourad (Chapter Nine), but all through the Study\nrun currents of a more common feeling of disconnection, in which men forge\nahead through the stages of their adult lives with fewer and fewer close\nfriendships. When given the oppor tunity to talk about the state of their\nfriendships\u2014an oppor tunity they rarely had outside of the Study\u2019s\ninvestigations\u2014these men almost always claimed their lack of close\nfriendships was due to their self-sufficiency and independence. At the same\ntime, many expressed a longing for more closeness with friends.\n\u201cMany men like me regret not having had more close friends,\u201d one\nparticipant told the Study. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a really close friend. My wife has\nmore friends than me.\u201d\nThough this experience with friends is common in the Study, particularly\nfor men, there is no strong evidence to support the belief that men are\nsomehow \u201cwired\u201d for emotional independence and stoicism and averse to\nintimacy. Instead, it\u2019s likely that this approach to friendships (and\nrelationships generally) is primarily the result of cultural forces. For\nexample, friendship patterns among LGBTQ+ individuals often differ from\nthose of their heterosexual counterparts, and there are likely to be\ngenerational differences in how men conduct their social lives as they age.\nResearch indicates that differences in friendship patterns between men\nand women are actually small. A number of longitudinal studies show that\nmale adolescents from many different backgrounds connect intimately with\nclose friends in ways that defy gender stereotypes. For example, psychologist\nNiobe Way has studied friendships among Black, Latino, and Asian\nAmerican adolescent and teenage boys who, like our own inner-city\nparticipants, grew up in modest circumstances in a major city.\n\u201cSecret sharing or talking intimately with best friends was how the boys\nin my studies defined a best friend,\u201d Way wrote. For example,\nMark says in his freshman year: \u201c[My best friend] could just tell\nme anything and I could tell him anything. Like I always know\neverything about him.\u2026 We always chill, like we don\u2019t hide secrets\nfrom each other. We tell each other our problems.\u201d\u2026 Eddie, a\nsophomore, says: \u201cIt\u2019s like a bond, we keep secrets, like if there is\nsomething that\u2019s important to me like I could tell him and he won\u2019t go\nand make fun of it. Like if my family is having problems or something.\u201d\nWhile boys spoke about loving to play basketball or videogames with\ntheir friends, the emphasis with their best friends was on talking\ntogether and sharing secrets.\nAs boys age into late adolescence and early adulthood, friendships often\nbecome more guarded, and less free. Some of this change is in response to\nchanging life circumstances, and occurs for both men and women\u2014jobs and\nromantic relationships get in the way. But for men there is often an extra set\nof powerful cultural forces at work. In many cultures around the world, boys\nare encouraged to display their independence and masculinity as they age,\nand they begin to worry that emotional closeness to male friends will make\nthem appear less masculine. Over time, certain intimacies between friends\nare lost.\nAdolescent female friendships are certainly subject to many of their own\npressures and constraints, but women in many cultures are expected to\ncontinue to maintain and nurture these intimate exchanges beyond the teen\nyears. These expectations may help support further intimacy but they may\nalso result in women carrying a heavier burden for navigating and solving\nemotional challenges in close relationships.\nIn 1987 the Study sent one questionnaire to the First Generation\nparticipants, and, if they were married, a second questionnaire to their\nwives. One of the things the Study was particularly interested in that year\nwas the couple\u2019s experience with friends.\nThe men were asked, How satisfied are you with the number of and\nyour closeness to friends (besides your wife)? Thirty percent said that they\nwere not satisfied and would like much more. When their wives were asked\na similar question, only 6 pe rcent said that they were not satisfied.\nAround this same time, sociologist Lillian Rubin was doing important\nwork looking at the question of why men and women seemed to experience\ntheir friendships differently.\nWomen, Rubin found, were more likely than men to keep up contact with\ntheir friends. The nature of their relationships was also different\u2014men were\nmore likely to organize friendships around activities, women were more\nlikely to be emotionally close, and to share intimate thoughts and feelings\nwith each other. Women had more face-to-face friendships, men had more\nside-by-side friendships.\nRubin\u2019s observations have found some support in reviews of multiple\nstudies, but as more and more research has been done on this topic, one thing\nhas become clear: the gender differences between what men and women\nseek in friendships are smaller than one might expect given our cultural\nassumptions.\nFor example, studies show that women generally have higher\nexpectations than men about having intimate exchanges in their friendships,\nbut this difference is small. In psychology, small differences between groups\nmean that the overlap among the two groups is the rule rather than the\nexception. As a whole, research shows that most people regardless of gender\nidentification want and need similar kinds of closeness and intimacy from\ntheir friends.\nTHE FRIENDSHIPS AT THE HEART OF THE\nHARVARD STUDY\nWhen Study participants receive a questionnaire in the mail, it doesn\u2019t\njust come with a return envelope. It comes with a friendly letter from the\nHarvard Study staff. Over the years there has been a great deal of\ncorrespondence between the staff and the participants, and a quick perusal of\nthese letters in the participants\u2019 files reveals the depth of connections that\nwere made. In the minds of First Generation participants, one particular\nname at the end of those letters came to be synonymous with the Harvard\nStudy: Lewise Gregory Davies.\nTrained as a social worker, Lewise joined the Study in its very first days,\nwhen Arlie Bock was just beginning the research. As the Study expanded,\nLewise became more and more involved in the outreach to participants. They\ncame to know her by name, would write her personal notes with news of\ntheir lives (even though their questionnaires covered most details), and if\nthey were late in returning a questionnaire, she would check in with them and\noffer an encouraging reminder. Lewise saw them as friends, even as a kind of\nsecond family. Many of them responded to questionnaires and interview\nrequests out of loyalty to her personally.\nEventually Lewise retired, but after her husband died, she found herself\nmissing the friends she\u2019d made at the Study, so she came back, and continued\nher work. It was this personal commitment to the Study, from Lewise and\nfrom others, that helped keep almost 90 percent of participants engaged in the\nStudy across eight decades. Our participants knew that they mattered not only\nto the Study and to the research\u2014most of which they would never see\u2014bu t\nto Lewise. In 1983, after she retired for the second time, Lewise wrote a\nshort note to all the participants in the Study, thanking them a final time for\none of the defining experiences of her life:\nDear Friends,\nThrough these many years I have treasured my friendship with you and your families. The\nmemories have been like a shining light in my life. Your loyalty and devotion to the Study have\ntouched me deeply. May the years ahead be rich in happiness and fulfillment for you and those\nyou love,\nDevotedly, your old and good friend,\nLewise\nThis was a relationship that might have seemed unimportant. Many of the\nparticipants met Lewise in person only once or twice, and some may have\nnever met her. But she was a part of their lives, and many were happy to have\nknown her. Even though it may have seemed a small, insignificant\nrelationship, in truth it was anything but. Like Rosa Keane in Chapter Nine,\nLewise cultivated strong connections at work and grew personally in the\nprocess. Were it not for all of these small connections, and the fleeting but\npositive feelings that came with them, the Harvard Study would probably not\nbe here today.\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF \u201cUNIMPORTANT\u201d\nRELATIONSHIPS\nHenry Keane, Rosa\u2019s husband, when asked for his definition of a true\nfriend, gave an answer that many of us would probably agree with:\n\u201cA true friend is someone you can always count on for companionship or\nfor help if you need it.\u201d\nThis is the kind of friendship that social scientists would call a \u201cstrong\ntie.\u201d These are the people we know will be there for us when things go\nwrong, who lift us up when we\u2019re down, and who we are prepared to\nsupport in their times of trouble. When most of us think of \u201cimportant\nfriends,\u201d these are the relationships that come to mind.\nBut a relationship doesn\u2019t need to be one of our most frequent or intimate\ncontacts to be valuable. In fact, few of us realize that some of our most\nbeneficial relationships can be with people we don\u2019t spend a lot of time\nwith or don\u2019t know very well. Even interactions with complete strangers\ncarry hidden benefits.\nConsider the most common and simplest of interactions: buying a cup of\ncoffee. When you go into the coffee shop, how often do you talk to the\nserver? How often do you ask with genuine interest how they\u2019re doing, or\nhow their work is going that day? You may or may not be in the habit of doing\nthis, but either way, most of us probably wouldn\u2019t think of these interactions\nas \u201cimportant.\u201d Is that true? Do these interactions matter at all?\nIn one fascinating study, researchers divided a set of participants (who\nwanted a coffee) into two groups: one group was instructed to have an\ninteraction with the barista, and the other to be as efficient as possible. Like\nthe \u201cstrangers on a train\u201d study that we mentioned in Chapter Two, the\nresearchers found that people who smiled, made eye contact, and had a\nsocial interaction with the barista\u2014in this case, a complete stranger\u2014came\naway feeling better, and with a greater sense of belonging, than those who\nwere instructed to be as efficient as possible. In short, having a friendly\nmoment with a stranger was uplifting.\nSmall moments can provide an uplift for our mood and they can help\nbalance out some of the stress we feel. An annoying commute can be softened\nby a short conversation with the security guard at work. A sense of\ndisconnection can be alleviated when we say hello to our mail carrier. These\nkinds of minute interactions can affect our mood and energy throughout the\nday. If we get in the habit of seeking out and noticing oppor tunities for these\ndaily uplifts, over time they can have far-reaching effects. Not only for us,\nbut for our social networks as a whole; repeated casual contact has been\nshown to foster the formation of closer friendships. And sometimes even the\nmost casual contact can open us up to whole new realms of experience.\nTHE LONG REACH OF \u201cWEAK\u201d TIES\nCasual friendships may be the most overlooked relationships we have.\nThey neither take up the most time nor impact our lives in the most obvious\nways. But there is now a great deal of research into the benefits of these\nconnections (which social scientists refer to as \u201cweak ties\u201d\u2014not our favorite\nterm since sometimes there\u2019s nothing weak about them). These are the\nrelationships we may not turn to when we\u2019re in distress, but that nonetheless\nprovide us with jolts of good feeling or energy during our days, as well as a\nsense of connection to larger communities.\nThe sociologist Mark Granovetter has done important research showing\nthe crucial significance of these casual ties. People we know only\nperipherally, Granovetter has argued, create important bridges to new social\nnetworks. These bridges allow for the flow of different and often surprising\nideas, the flow of otherwise unavailable information, and the flow of\noppor tunities. Granovetter has shown, for example, that people who cultivate\ncasual ties are more likely to find better work. When you increase the\ncomplexity of a social system, a wider variety of things can happen. Casual\nties can also lead to a more expansive sense of our own community. The\nmore we talk to people outside of our bubbles, connect with them and\nhumanize our experiences with them, the more empathic we can be when\nconflicts arise.\nLook at your \u201csocial universe\u201d chart from Chapter Four. Or, if you didn\u2019t\nmake a chart, just think for a moment about your friend universe, and the\nkinds of interactions you have on a daily basis. Do you have relationships\nthat connect you to other social groups? How about friends that expose you to\nnew or different ideas? Are there oppor tunities to cultivate some of the\n\u201cweak\u201d ties in your social universe?\nThese casual relationships are also the most changeable; they often drift\nin and out as our lives change. Harvard Study participants\u2019 connections to\nLewise Gregory and the Harvard Study staff were maintained because of\nyears of systematic effort and devotion; most distant or casual relationships\ndon\u2019t get that kind of attention.\nIn Chapter Three we talked about the ways that our relationships change\nas our position in the lifespan changes, and this is especially true for friends.\nOften, gaps in our map of friendships open up because our lives no longer\neasily accommodate a certain kind of relationship. We\u2019ve morphed from\nyoung adults who had time to hang out with friends most evenings and\nweekends into parents of small children with hardly a moment to ourselves.\nOr we\u2019ve transitioned from busy workdays filled with meetings with\ncoworkers to the long-awaited freedom of retirement where we find\nourselves suddenly more alone than we expected. As we move through life,\nour social lives don\u2019t always keep pace.\nDIFFERENT FRIENDS FOR DIFFERENT TIMES\n(FRIENDS THROUGH LIFE STAGES)\nTake a walk through your town or neighborhood on a summer day and\nyou might see slices of friendship among people at every stage of life:\nadolescent boys and girls playing team sports; middle-aged adults meeting\nfor coffee or out for a run together; a group of parents at a playground, all\nwith toddlers and children about the same age; octogenarians meeting for a\ngame of chess in the park.\nOur stage of life has a major impact on the role that friendships play and\nthe types of friendships we have. New friendships often arise out of\nparticular life situations, and they can also help us navigate those situations.\nAdolescents find connections through discovering new things together\nand sharing their thoughts and feelings. College students, wrapped up in the\nintense experience of being on their own for the first time, bond over\ncommon challenges, developing trust in each other along the way. New\nparents thirst for firsthand information about childrearing and look for people\nwho know what they\u2019re going through, who they can turn to for both\nemotional and practical support (Marc and Joan, by the way, continued to\nrely on Bob and Jennifer for this support, including for some babysitting so\nthey could enjoy their first date night after Joan recovered). And as we have\ndiscussed, giving help can be as important to our wellbeing as receiving it,\nso parents at a more advanced stage (as Bob and Jennifer were) benefit from\nproviding that type of support. Life-stage-specific connections can be strong\nbecause these friends have gone through something powerful together. When\nlife changes again, as it always does, these friendships may fade. But\nsometimes even a short period of intense connection can forge friendships\nthat last for decades and endure through many other life stages.\nWe don\u2019t always go through life stages in lockstep with our friends. We\nmay have friends who were in sync with us in the past but who suddenly\nseem out of step with our lives right now. If we want to maintain those\nconnections, we may have to work harder to bridge the gap, and to\nunderstand what those friends\u2019 lives are like.\nThis happens all the time with people who have not found a partner, but\nwhose friends are already married and having kids. Suddenly these single\nadults find themselves in a different world. Now conversations revolve\naround babies and diapers, and the friends without children can feel left\nbehind. It may not be so much about feelings of jealousy as about loss of a\nconnection that seemed as though it might be there, in the same way, forever.\nBut with every passage from one life stage into another, it\u2019s natural that\ncertain friendships will be lost. One common theme among a huge number of\nStudy participants, both women and men, is the loss of friends after\nretirement. As we discussed in Chapter Nine, for some of us work is the\nfoundation of our social universe. When it\u2019s removed, our social fitness can\nsuffer.\nThis happened to Pete Mills, one of our college participants. Once he\nretired from his career as a lawyer, he realized with some concern that his\nentire social life had been built around his work and that he needed to be\nproactive in rebuilding his social connections. In an effort to find some new\nfriends, he and his wife took up bow ling.\n\u201cI asked how much entertaining they did,\u201d a Study interviewer wrote in\nher field notes.\nMonday night, he said, they had had 20 for \u201cdrinks and heavy\nappetizers\u201d after bowling. Friday night they had had 6 for dinner. He\ndoes the floors. She dusts.\nI asked what the two of them did together that brought them the\nmost joy. \u201cWe do a lot of socializing,\u201d he said. The bowling group gets\ntogether once a month. They have a play reading group that also gets\ntogether regularly. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t read loud enough. I do,\u201d he said\nmischievously.\nI asked about connections with people outside the family. \u201cWe do a\nlot of connecting,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we keep up with a lot of old friends. It\nis a lot of work. People don\u2019t do it, so you have to do it yourself.\u201d I\nasked who he considered to be his closest friend. He thought for a while\nand mentioned a couple that they get together with regularly to go\nmuseum hopping, to share travel stories and pictures. \u201cThere are\nseveral people in this play reading group,\u201d he said, \u201cthat are very close\nfriends.\u201d He also feels close to his \u201conly surviving roommate\u201d [from\ncollege] who lives in Cambridge, but acknowledged that he didn\u2019t see\nhim very often anymore. \u201cProbably our closest friends are here now,\u201d\nhe said. Most are people they have met in the years since he retired.\nPete is a great of example of a participant actively finding and\nmaintaining friends. And he was right: keeping up with old friends is a lot of\nwork and many people find it difficult or don\u2019t bother. But he and his wife\nwere both predisposed to doing so and particularly enjoyed large gatherings.\nWe\u2019re not all that way. Not all of us (or even very many of us) are going to\nget excited to host twenty people at our house a few times a month. But the\npoint is to understand what kind of connections help us thrive. Are we getting\nenough of those connections? If not, are there steps we can take in that\ndirection?\nTHE PATH AHEAD\nListening is a magnetic and strange thing, a creative force.\u2026 the\nfriends that really listen to us are the ones we move toward.\u2026 W hen we\nare listened to, it creates us, makes us unfold and expand.\nBrenda Ueland\nFriendships are some of the easiest relationships to neglect. Over and\nover throughout the lives of Harvard Study participants we see friendships\nthat have deteriorated, for both men and women, because of neglect. Part of\nwhat makes friendships wonderful is also what makes them fleeting: they are\nvoluntary. But that doesn\u2019t make them any less significant. So you may need\nto be purposeful about maintaining the friendships you already have, and\nabout creating new friendships.\nOne of the most common questions people ask us is: How many friends\ndo I need? Five? Ten? O ne?\nUnfortunately, we can\u2019t answer this question for you! People are just too\ndifferent. You may feel at your best with two close friends, or you may feel at\nyour best with a whole host of friends that you share different activities with\nand invite over for large gatherings. Depending on which stage of life you\u2019re\nin, you may find yourself needing different things. You might start looking\ntoward causes and activities that you care about and developing new friends\nand communities around those. To discover what is best and most fulfilling\nfor you will take some self-reflection. But here are some things to think about\nregarding the friends in your life:\nFriendships can suffer from some of the same things that family\nrelationships suffer from: chronic conflict, boredom, absence of curiosity,\nfailure to pay attention.\nLearn to listen to your friends. As Brenda Ueland suggests, listening\ndoes as much for the listener as for the person being listened to. Truly\nabsorbing the experience of another person encourages both the listener and\nthe speaker to \u201cunfold,\u201d to emerge from our shells, and our lives are often\nricher for it. We all have sensitive spots in our lives that make navigating the\nmost intimate conversations more difficult, but the rewards are worth the\neffort. For example, people are often very private about an illness, and\nwould like to be able to share, but worry about burdening their friends. Just\nshowing that you\u2019d like to hear more when they mention a medical concern\nmay be enough to ope n that door .\nBeing listened to makes us feel understood, cared for, and seen. You may\nfind that simply being there for a friend and listening creates an environment\nin which you yourself are seen and heard\u2026 but you have to be brave enough\nto give your friends something to listen to. It\u2019s also often the case in\nfriendships that one person is more likely to listen, and the other more likely\nto talk. Figure out which one you are; there might be oppor tunities to balance\nthings out. The strongest friendships flow both ways.\nConsider the rifts in your life. Friendships can cause us hurt that we\nharbor for a long time. But rifts between friends don\u2019t have to be permanent.\nSometimes all it takes is a simple mea culpa, or an olive branch\u2014a kind text\nmessage, an offer to buy lunch, a quick birthday call\u2014to repair a wound\nfrom the past. Sometimes we might righteously protect that sense of injury\nmore tenaciously than we ever protected the friendship itself. Letting grudges\ngo can free us from that burden.\nFinally, think about  your social routines. We often fall into routines\nwith the friends we see most frequently. We talk about the same types of\nthings, the same troubles, over and over. Is there more you would like from a\nparticular friend? Is there more you can give? Perhaps there is more you\nwant to know about that friend or their past. Or something new that the two of\nyou could explore together.\nReading this chapter, you may be thinking that these kinds of efforts are\nbeyond your ability. You might feel lonely, but you also feel set in your ways.\nOld social habits are hard to change, and we all have certain psychological\nbarriers, like shyness or aversion to groups, that make changing our social\ncircumstances difficult. Maybe you feel it\u2019s too late for you.\nIf this is you, you\u2019re not alone. A common refrain among some Harvard\nStudy participants, regardless of gender, is the view that at some point in\nadult life, it becomes impossible to change the nature of our friendships.\nExpressions of loneliness in the Study will often be followed by statements\nlike, \u201cI suppos e that\u2019s just how it is\u2026\u201d or \u201cLife just gets too busy for\nfriends\u2026\u201d Even in a written response on a formal questionnaire, you can\nalmost hear the resignation in participants\u2019 voices.\nAndrew Dearing was one of these. Deep down, he just knew that his life\nwould never change. Like many people\u2014pe rhaps like you\u2014he believed that\nit was too late.\nIT\u2019S TOO LATE FOR ME\nAndrew Dearing lived one of the most difficult and lonely lives of any\nStudy participant. As a child, his father was absent, his mother and siblings\nhad to move constantly from one place to another, and he didn\u2019t develop any\nlasting friends. In his early adulthood his struggles with meaningful\nfriendships continued, and he was 34 when he married. His wife was quite\ncritical of Andrew and was averse to most social situations. She didn\u2019t want\nto see anybody , and she didn\u2019t want him to see anybody . They never went out,\nand they rarely had anyone over to visit. His marriage was one of the greatest\nstresses of his life.\nThe only thing in life that made him happy was his work. He was a clock\nrepairman, and he enjoyed taking apart old grandfather clocks and cuckoo\nclocks and making them run again. People always came in with family stories\nabout their clocks, and he felt good about bringing these heirlooms back to\nlife for customers. When asked in his late 50s at what age he planned to\nretire, he wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t know for sure. I have been working since I was\neight years old. Work has kept me alive. Retiring sounds and feels like it\u2019s\nthe end of the road. So I would like to continue working.\u201d\nBut through most of his adult life, he reported very low levels of\nhappiness and satisfaction. At the age of 45, at a moment of deep despair,\nAndrew attempted suicide. Twenty years later, he was still struggling. \u201cI\u2019ve\nthought of ending it,\u201d he wrote in the margins of one questionnaire.\nWhen asked in his mid-60s to describe his closest friends in life and\nwhat they had meant to him, Andrew wrote simply, \u201cNo one.\u201d When asked\nwhat he did for fun, he wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t do anything. I stay home all the time\nexcept to go to work.\u201d\nWhen Andrew was 67, his eyesight had deteriorated to the point that he\ncould no longer execute precision work on clocks, and he was forced to\nretire. Shortly afterward, he went to a therapist for the first time in his life.\nThere he discussed how alone he felt in the world, and how sad he was about\nhaving to end his work. He shared that he was having suicidal thoughts. The\ntherapist asked if he\u2019d ever thought of leaving his wife. Andrew hadn\u2019t. He\nfelt it would be unkind to her. But the conversation stuck with him, and the\nnext year at the age of 68, although he didn\u2019t divorce his wife, he separated\nfrom her, and moved into an apartment by himself.\nNow, though he was relieved to be free of the constraints of his marriage,\nAndrew felt lonelier than ever. On a whim, he decided he would start going\nto the health club near his house and exercise to get his mind off things. He\nbegan to go every day, and noticed he was seeing the same people there, day\nin and day out. One day he said hello to another regular and introduced\nhimself.\nThree months later, Andrew knew everyone at the club and had more\nfriends than he\u2019d ever had in his life. Every day he looked forward to his\ntime at the health club, and he began to see some of his friends outside of the\nclub. He discovered that a few of them shared a love for old movies, and\nthey started having get-togethers to screen their favorite films for each other.\nA couple of years later, when asked on a Study questionnaire if he ever\nfelt lonely, Andrew wrote, \u201cYes, often.\u201d After all, he was now living alone.\nBut when asked how ideal his life was on a scale from 1 to 7, Andrew\ncircled \u201c7\u201d for \u201cclose to ideal.\u201d Even though he still felt lonely, his life was\nso much more fulfilling than it had been that he almost couldn\u2019t imagine it\ngetting any better.\nEight years after that, in 2010, Andrew was still close with many of the\nsame friends, had expanded his social circle even further, and expressed\ngreat relief that he had changed his life. When he\u2019d been asked years earlier\nhow often he left his home to see others or had people visit him, he\u2019d\nanswered, \u201cNever.\u201d\nNow, when asked the same question in his 80s, he answered, \u201cDaily.\u201d\nBecause life circumstances vary so much, because people themselves\nvary so much over time, it\u2019s difficult to make a blanket statement about what\nis and isn\u2019t possible in someone\u2019s life. But Andrew was one of the most\nisolated and lonely people in the Study, and he found relief. He changed his\nroutine and connected with others, and in the process extended himself into\nthe world in a way that made him feel valued.\nWe live in a world that hungers for greater human connection. Sometimes\nwe might feel that we are adrift in life, that we\u2019re alone and that we\u2019re past\nthe point where we can do anything to change that. Andrew had felt this way.\nHe\u2019d believed that he was long, long past that point. But he was wrong. It\nwasn\u2019t too late. Because the truth is, it\u2019s never too late.\nConclusion\nIT\u2019S NEVER TOO LATE TO BE HAPPY\nHarvard Study Questionnaire, 1983:\nQ: Every investigation alters what is being investigated. Over the past few decades what\nalterations has the Harvard Study made in your life?\nIn 1941 Henry Keane was 14 years old, and healthy. While he lived in a\nneighborhood defined by pove rty, and this deprivation led many of the kids\nhe knew into trouble, Henry had somehow avoided that path. Interested in\nunderstanding why, a young researcher from Harvard walked up the three\nflights of Henry\u2019s tenement on a rainy day to talk to Henry and his parents\nabout participating in a cutting-edge research project. Researchers hoped to\ngive him regular physical health check-ups and talk with him about his life\nperiodically for several years to see what they could learn about the lives of\nyoung boys in the poorest areas of Boston. Close to five hundred other boys\nhis age from other Boston neighborhoods  were also being recruited, most of\nthem from immigrant families like Henry\u2019s.\nHenry\u2019s parents were skeptical, but the researcher seemed trustworthy.\nThey agreed.\nA few years before that, Leo DeMarco and John Marsden, both 19-year-\nold sophomores at Harvard College, made appointments at the Student\nHealth Services office to meet with Arlie Bock, who signed them up for a\nsimilar study looking at what made young men thrive. After their first two-\nhour interviews, he had each of them come back the following week.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine,\u201d John said, \u201cwhat more you could possibly have to\nask me. I never thought I had more than two hours\u2019 worth of things to say\nabout myself.\u201d\nBoth of these studies were meant to go on for several years. Maybe ten\nyears, if they could find more funding.\nThese three boys had their entire lives in front of them. Looking at their\nintake photos today, Bob and Marc feel a sense of wonder and nostalgia\nsimilar to what we might feel looking at the photograph of an old friend.\nNone of the participants could know the challenges they would face, none of\nthem could see where life would take them.\nSome of their cohort, boys just like them, died in the coming war. Some\ndied of complications related to alcoholism. Some became rich, some even\nbecame famous.\nSome lives were happy. Some were not.\nEighty years later we now know that Henry and Leo are in the happy\ngroup. They grew into engaged, healthy men, with positive and realistic\nviews of the world. We look at their files\u2014at their lives\u2014and within the\nnormal flow of bad luck and tragedy and hard times, we see some lucky\nbreaks. They fell in love, they adored their children, they found meaning in\ntheir communities. They led lives that were largely positive and that they felt\ngrateful for having lived.\nJohn is in the unhappy group. He started life with privileges, including\nmaterial wealth, and also caught some lucky breaks. He was a brilliant\nstudent, went to Harvard, and fulfilled his dream of becoming a successful\nlawyer. But his mother died when he was 16 and he was also bullied as a\nchild for many years. Over time, he developed a wariness of people and\nhabitually negative ways of coping with the world. He had difficulty\nconnecting with others, and when he encountered challenges, his instinct was\nto withdraw from the people closest to him. He married twice, and never felt\nthat he was truly loved.\nHow might we have helped John if we could go back to that day he had\nhis picture taken at age 19? Could we use some of what John helped the\nStudy discover to help him cope with his life? Here, we might say to him,\nThis is the life of someone we studied. He lived it so that you might do it\nbetter.\nBut many of the most significant findings, naturally, came after the\nparticipants had already lived much of their lives. So they didn\u2019t have the\nbenefit of the research we\u2019ve presented at the times when it would have\nhelped them most.\nThat\u2019s why we wrote this book : to share with you what we couldn\u2019t share\nwith them. Because one thing the large body  of research into human\nflourishing clearly shows\u2014from our longitudinal study and from dozens of\nothers\u2014is that it doesn\u2019t matter how old you are, where you are in the life\ncycle, whether you are married or not married, introverted or extroverted;\neveryone can m ake positive turns in their life.\nJohn Marsden is a pseudonym. His profession and other identifying\ndetails have been changed to protect his identity. The real man behind the\nname has unfortunately passed away. It\u2019s too late for him. But if you\u2019re\nreading this book , it\u2019s not too late for you.\nLIVING AN EXAMINED LIFE\nIt has often been asked about the Harvard Study: Did the Study\u2019s\nquestions affect how participants lived? Are the data distorted by a kind of\npsychological Heisenberg effect, where the participants\u2019 lives are shaped by\nthe act of self-examination?\nThis was a question that Arlie Bock and all the subsequent Study\ndirectors and researchers have been interested in. On one hand, it\u2019s an\nimpossible question to answer. As the saying goes, we can never step into the\nsame river twice: there\u2019s no way to know what each participant\u2019s life would\nhave been like if they\u2019d not been involved in the Study. The participants\nthemselves, however, had some ideas:\n\u201cSorry, but I don\u2019t think it has had any influence,\u201d was one typical\nresponse.\n\u201cOnly as a topic of conversation. Sorry!\u201d was another.\nJohn Marsden answered simply: \u201cNone.\u201d\nJoseph Cichy (Chapter Seven) also wrote, \u201cNone,\u201d and then offered what\nhe believed to be the reason: \u201cI have not had feedback which I can translate\ninto a message for me.\u201d\nOthers, however, acknowledged turning the Study\u2019s investigations\naround, and using them to consider their lives and to open themselves to the\npossibilities of living differently.\n\u201cThe Study has caused me to reassess my life every two years,\u201d one\nparticipant wrote.\nAnother laid out his entire self-assessment regimen: \u201cIt makes me review,\nchallenge present activities, take stock, clarify directions and priorities, and\nassess my marital relationship, which after thirty-seven years has become so\nbasic a part of life as to be unquestioned.\u201d\n\u201cMakes me reflect for a bit,\u201d Leo DeMarco wrote. \u201cMakes me rejoice in\nmy circumstances; a lovely wife who generally tolerates my foibles. The\nquestions make me aware that there are other lifestyles, other options, other\nexperiences which are might-have-beens but weren\u2019t.\u201d\nThe fact that participants were affected by the Study\u2019s questions is itself a\nuseful lesson for the rest of us. We may not have the Study calling us on the\nphone and bugging us to answer questions every two years, but we can still\ntake a moment now and then to consider where we are and where we would\nlike to be. It is these moments of stepping back, and looking at our lives, that\ncan help us clear the fog and choose a path forward.\nBut which path?\nWe tend to think we know what makes us feel fulfilled, what is good for\nus, and what is bad for us. No one knows us, we think, quite like we know\nourselves. The problem is we\u2019re so good at being ourselves, we don\u2019t\nalways see that there might be another way.\nRecall the wisdom of the Zen master Shunryu Suzuki: \u201cIn the beginner\u2019s\nmind there are many possibilities, but in the expert\u2019s mind there are few.\u201d\nAsking honest questions about ourselves is the first step toward\nrecognizing that we may not be experts on our own lives. When we accept\nthis, and we accept that we may not have all the answers, we step into the\nrealm of possibility. And that is a step in the right direction.\nIN PURSUIT OF SOMETHING BIGGER\nIn 2005 we had a luncheon for the inner-city Boston participants, who at\nthat time were in their 70s. There was a table for Southie (South Boston),\nRoxbury, the West End, the North End, Charlestown, and all the other Boston\nneighborhoods  represented in the Study. Some of the participants even knew\neach other from school or by virtue of having grown up in the same\nneighborhoods . Some traveled from across the country and came dressed in\ntheir best suits and ties, others just drove to the West End from around the\ncorner, dressed in whatever they happened to be wearing that day. Some\nbrought their wives and their children, many of whom have joined the Study\nthemselves.\nOur participants\u2019 dedication to the Study has been humbling. Eighty-four\npercent of our First Generation participants continued their involvement for\ntheir entire lives. The typical longitudinal study has a much higher dropou t\nrate and does not come close to covering entire lifetimes. What\u2019s more, 68\npercent of their children agreed to take part in the Second Generation study\u2014\nan astonishingly high rate of participation. Even those First Generation\nparticipants who have long since passed away made contributions that will\naffect research for years to come. They\u2019ve left us with vials of their blood,\nwhich in combination with their health and psychological data and historical\nassessments of Boston neighborhoods  are being used to study the long-term\nhealth effects of lead and other environmental contaminants. As they\napproached the end of their lives, some participants even agreed to donate\ntheir brains to the Study. Honoring these requests was not easy for their\nfamilies, who had to go through considerable inconvenience at a time of\nmourning in order to make sure that the Study could take possession of their\nloved ones\u2019 remains. Thanks to all of this dedication, participants\u2019 lives\ncontinue to matter, and their legacy will live on.\nThis has been a mutually life-enhancing project. We, the generations of\nHarvard Study staff members, have been enlivened by our connection to the\nparticipants. In turn, the creativity and commitment of our staff members has\nenabled hundreds of families to be part of something unique in the history of\nscience. Lewise Gregory, whom we mentioned in Chapter Ten and who\nworked for the Study for most of its lifespan, is one of the best examples of\nthis. Our participants responded to questionnaires during some of the busiest\nand most difficult times of their lives not only because they believed in the\nresearch, but also because they felt loyal to Lewise and other Study staff. A\nstudy that slowly uncovered the value of relationships was itself sustained, in\nthe end, by  relationships.\nOver the years, these relationships formed a kind of invisible community.\nSome participants didn\u2019t meet anyone else in the Study until very late in their\nlives and others never knew a single other person who was involved. But\nthey felt a connection to the Study nonetheless. Some participants, wary of\nself-disclosure, were reluctant in the beginning but continued anyway. Others\nlooked forward to getting calls from the Study and enjoyed the experience of\nbeing checked on and listened to. Most, however, were proud to be part of\nsomething bigger than themselves. In this way, they thought of the Study as a\npiece of their own generativity, part of their own mark on the world, and they\ntrusted that eventually their lives would be of use to people they would never\nmeet.\nThis speaks to a concern that many of us have: Do I matter?\nSome of us have lived the majority of our lives and find ourselves\nlooking back, others have most of our lives in front of us and are looking\nforward. For all of us, regardless of age, it helps to remember that this\nquestion of mattering, of leaving something for future generations and of\nbeing part of something bigger than ourselves, is not just about our personal\nachievements\u2014it\u2019s about what we mean to other people. And it\u2019s never too\nlate to start now and leave a mark.\nFILLING IN THE GAPS\nIn the scope of human history, the \u201cscience of happiness\u201d is a recent idea.\nSlowly but surely, science is uncovering useful answers to what makes\npeople thrive across the entire lifespan. New findings, new insights, and new\nstrategies for how to bring happiness research into real life continue to\nevolve. If you want to keep track of our latest efforts, they can be found at the\nLifespan Research Foundation (www.Lifespanresearch.org).\nThe primary challenge of happiness research comes in the application of\ninsight to actual lives, each of which is highly individual and does not fit\nneatly into any group template. The findings and ideas we\u2019ve presented in\nthis book  are based on research, but science can\u2019t know the turmoil or\ncontradictions you feel in your heart. It can\u2019t quantify the stir that you\nexperience when a certain friend calls. It can\u2019t know what keeps you up at\nnight, or what you regret, or how you express your love. Science can\u2019t say\nwhether you\u2019re calling your kids too much or too little, or whether you\nshould reconnect with a particular family member. It can\u2019t say if it would be\nbetter for you to have a heart-to-heart over a cup of coffee or play a game of\nbasketball or go for a walk with a friend. Those answers can only come\nthrough reflection, and figuring out what works for you. For anything in this\nbook  to be useful, you will need to tune in to your unique life experience and\nmake its lessons your own.\nBut here\u2019s what science can tell you:\nGood r elationships keep us happi er, healthier, and he lp us live longe r.\nThis is true across the lifespan, and across cultures and contexts, which\nmeans it is almost certainly true for you, and for nearly every human being\nwho has ever lived.\nTHE FOURTH \u201cR\u201d\nFew things affect the quality of our lives as much as our connections to\nothers. As we\u2019ve said many times before, human beings are primarily social\nanimals. The implications of that fact may be much vaster than many of us\nrealize.\nBasic education is sometimes referred to as the three Rs: reading,\nwriting, and arithmetic. Because early education is meant to prepare students\nfor life, we believe there should be a fourth R in basic education:\nrelationships.\nHumans are not born with the biological need to read and write, though\nthe skills are now fundamental to society. We are not born with a need to do\nmath, though the modern world would not exist without it. We are, however,\nborn with a need to connect with other people. Because this need for\nconnection is fundamental to a flourishing life, we believe that social fitness\nshould be taught to children and be a central consideration in public policy\nright alongside exercise, diet, and other health recommendations. Making\nsocial fitness central to health education is especially important in the context\nof rapidly evolving technologies that affect how we communicate and\ndevelop relational skills.\nThere are signs that the world is catching on. There are now hundreds of\nstudies showing that positive relationships have a health benefit, and we\u2019ve\ncited many of them in this book . Courses in social and emotional learning\n(SEL) focus on helping students learn self-awareness, identify and manage\nemotions, and hone their relationship skills. These programs are being tested\nin schools all over the world. Across age, race, gender, and class, this\nresearch suggests that, compared with students who did not receive this\neducation, students in these programs showed more positive behaviors with\npeers, had better academic performance, fewer conduct problems, less drug\nuse, and less emotional distress. These programs are a step in the right\ndirection, and their impact shows that this emphasis on relationships pays\noff. Efforts to bring these same lessons to adults in organizations,\nworkplaces, and community centers are also under way.\nADVERSITY ON THE PATH TO THE GOOD\nLIFE\nWe are living in a time of global crisis. Connecting with our fellow\nhuman beings takes on new urgency in this context. The Covid-19 pandemic\nput this need for connection into stark relief. As the disease spread and\nlockdowns began, many people reached out to solidify the most important\nrelationships in their lives, to boost their sense of connection and security.\nThen, as the lockdowns stretched from weeks to months and beyond, people\nbegan feeling the effects of social isolation in strange and sometimes\nprofound ways. Our bodies and minds, inextricably intertwined, reacted to\nthe stress of isolation. People all over the world began experiencing health\nimpacts as schoolkids lost regular contact with their friends and teachers,\nworkers lost the presence of their workmates, weddings were postponed,\nfriendships sidelined, and those of us who had access to the internet had to\nsettle for connecting through computer screens. Suddenly it became clear that\nschools, movie theaters, restaurants, and ballparks weren\u2019t just about\nlearning, watching movies, eating food, and playing sports. They were about\nbeing together.\nGlobal crises will continue to impact our collective well-being. But as\nwe struggle with how to confront these challenges, we must remember that\nevery one of us has only the moment before us, in the place we stand. It is our\napproach to each unfolding moment and our connections to the individuals\nwe encounter in our lives\u2014family, friends, people in our communities and\nbeyond\u2014that will ultimately serve as a bulwark against whatever crises we\nconfront.\nWhen the Harvard Study participants were kids, they couldn\u2019t have\nenvisioned the difficulties they would face, either in the world or in their\nown lives. Leo DeMarco could not have seen World War II coming. Henry\nKeane couldn\u2019t do anything about the pove rty that the Great Depression\nbrought on his family. And we can\u2019t foresee exactly what challenges will\nconfront us in the future. But we know they will come.\nThousands of stories from the Harvard Study show us that the good life is\nnot found by providing ourselves with leisure and ease. Rather, it arises from\nthe act of facing inevitable challenges, and from fully inhabiting the moments\nof our lives. It appears, quietly, as we learn how to love and how to open\nourselves to being loved, as we grow from our experiences, and as we stand\nin solidarity with others through the inevitable string of joys and adversities\nin every human life.\nA FINAL DECISION\nHow do you move further along on your own path toward a good life?\nFirst, by recognizing that the good life is not a destination. It is the path itself,\nand the people who are walking it with you. As you walk, second by second\nyou can decide to whom and to what you give your attention. Week by week\nyou can prioritize your relationships and choose to be with the people who\nmatter. Year by year you can find purpose and meaning through the lives that\nyou enrich and the relationships that you cultivate. By developing your\ncuriosity and reaching out to others\u2014family, loved ones, coworkers, friends,\nacquaintances, even strangers\u2014with one thoughtful question at a time, one\nmoment of devoted, authentic attention at a time, you strengthen the\nfoundation of a good l ife.\nWe\u2019ll make a final suggestion to get you started.\nThink about someone, just one person, who is important to you. Someone\nwho may not know how much they really mean to you. It could be your\nspouse, your significant other, a friend, a coworker, a sibling, a parent, a\nchild, or even a coach or a teacher from your younger days. This person\ncould be sitting beside you as you read or listen to this book , they could be\nstanding over the sink washing dishes, or in another city, another country.\nThink about where they stand in their lives. What are they struggling with?\nThink about what they mean to you, what they have done for you in your life.\nWhere would you be without them? Who would you be?\nNow think about what you would thank them for if you thought you would\nnever see them again.\nAnd at this moment\u2014right now\u2014turn to them. Call them. Tell them.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis book bears witness to one fundamental truth: We are sustained in a\nweb of relationships that give our life meaning and goodn ess. We are\nprofoundly grateful to the many people whose kindness and wisdom enabled\nus to create this work.\nThe two of us began our friendship and collaboration nearly three\ndecades ago at Massachusetts Mental Health Center, when we were research\nfellows in the laboratory of Stuart Hauser. His longitudinal study of\nadolescents introduced us to the riches that can be found in tracking\nindividual lives through time, and Stuart taught us the value of listening to\npeople\u2019s stories.\nBob\u2019s teacher at Harvard Medical School, George Vaillant, was the third\ndirector of the Harvard Study of Adult Development. His insights into adult\ndevelopmental science have shaped how the world thinks about the human\nlife cycle, and his willingness to entrust this precious longitudinal project to\na next generation of researchers was a profoundly generative gift. Of course,\nwe stand on the shoulders of all of the previous directors: Clark Heath, Arlie\nBock, and Charles MacArthur, who pioneered the study of the Harvard\nCollege student cohort, and Eleanor and Sheldon Glueck, who originated the\nstudy of the inner-city Boston cohort. None of this research could happen\nwithout funding, and the Harvard Study would not have been possible\nwithout support from the National Institute of Mental Health, the National\nInstitute on Aging, the W. T. Grant Foundation, the Harvard NeuroDiscovery\nCenter, the Fidelity Foundation, the Blum-Kovler Foundation, the Weil\nMemorial Charitable Foundation, and Ken Bartels and Jane Condon.\nConducting a longitudinal study of this depth requires the dedication and\npatience of a village. This community included steady shepherds\u2014Lewise\nGregory, Eva Milofsky, and Robin Western\u2014who maintained vital\nconnections with our Study participants over decades. And it continues to\ninclude a convoy of talented postdoctoral fellows, predoctoral students,\nundergraduates, and even some high schoolers\u2014too many to name\u2014all of\nwhom have brought curiosity and fresh perspectives that continually enliven\nour work. Extending the Study to the children of our original participants was\nonly possible with the guidance of a remarkable set of colleagues: Margie\nLachman, Kris Preacher, Teresa Seeman, and Ron Spiro. Our colleague Mike\nNevarez continues to use his engineer\u2019s precision and medical training to\noversee the introduction of twenty-first-century biological measures and\ndigital tools in our Second Generation study.\nWhen Bob gave a TEDx talk in 2015 that was widely circulated, it\nbecame clear that many people were eager to learn what developmental\nscience can tell us about human thriving. Our friend and colleague John\nHumphrey had the vision to create and lead the Lifespan Research\nFoundation (www.Lifespanresearch.org), a nonprofit organization with the\nmission of using the insights of lifespan research to enable people to live\nhealthier lives filled with meaning, connection, and purpose. His death in\nMay of 2022 is a loss we still feel, but we continue to be inspired by his\nenergy and passion for using research to help others. The Foundation team\u2014\nJohn, Marianne Doherty, Susan Friedman, Betsy Gillis, Linda Hotchkiss,\nMike Nevarez, Connie Steward, and others\u2014has enabled us to take research\nfindings that hide in academic journals and translate them into user-friendly\ntools for those seeking science-based wisdom about well-being.\nThe Good Life was the creation of another village: Doug Abrams at Idea\nArchitects had a vision that turned out to be almost exactly what the book\nbecame. His belief in the project, and the experience of the Idea Architects\nteam\u2014pa rticularly Lara Love, Sarah Rainone, and Rachel Neumann\u2014\nprovided clear guidance through the murky terrain of designing and crafting a\nbook  about our life\u2019s work. Rob Pirro shared with us his deep knowledge of\nphilosophical perspectives on the good life. We were blessed with several\ngenerous readers of the manuscript: Cary Crall, Michelle Francl, Kate\nPetrova, and Jennifer Stone each provided invaluable perspectives and\nhelped sharpen our ideas and writing.\nAt Simon & Schuster, Jonathan Karp and Bob Bender had the faith to\ncommit to the book  at a time of great uncertainty in the world. Their\nenthusiasm for the project was truly infectious, and it was our good fortune to\nwork with Bob, a seasoned editor whose steady and gentle hand shaped the\nmanuscript with care and wisdom. Johanna Li guided us through the graphic\ndesign of the book. We also thank copyeditor Fred Chase. Saliann St-Clair,\nJemma McDonagh, Brittany Poulin, and Camilla Ferrier of the Marsh\nAgency, and Caspian Dennis and Sandy Violette from Abner Stein helped us\nto bring the book  to the wider world through international contracts. And we\nare grateful to the more than 20 translation publishers who saw the value of\nbringing the book  to people around the globe.\nWe might not have had the courage to write this book  were it not for many\npeople who believed in the project. Tal Ben-Shahar, Arthur Blank, Richard\nLayard, Vivek Murthy, Laurie Santos, Guy Raz, Jay Shetty, Tim Shriver, and\nCarol Yu were among those who gave encouragement when we might have\ngotten cold feet. Our colleagues Angela Duckworth, Eli Finkel, Ramon\nFlorenzano, Peter Fonagy, Julianne Holt-Lunstad, and Dominik Schoebi, who\nare exemplars of how to bring the insights of scientific research out into the\nworld in accessible and impactful ways, also offered early encouragement.\nMark Hitz was at the center of this project from the beginning. A keen\nand empathic observer of human experience and a writer of immense skill\nand subtlety, he learned to dance with us in a world that was completely new\nto him. He brought an ear for the music of language that you will hear\nthroughout the book . He helped us breathe life into research findings using\nthe stories that he found in reams of Study records. All of this was done with\npersistence and patience that could only have come from his deep respect for\nthe people who told us their stories. We will always be grateful that Mark\nturned his talents to this collaboration.\nOur greatest debt is to the women and men who participate in the\nHarvard Study of Adult Development. How do we begin to thank the\ngenerations of people who offer their life stories so that the world can gain a\nricher and deeper understanding of the human condition? In sharing their\nlives, they give a gift to science and to all of us. They remind us how\ngenerous people can be, and how essential it is that we appreciate our shared\nhumanity. We can never repay this debt, but our hope is that, in some small\nmeasure, this book  pays it forward.\nBob\nWhether it\u2019s luck or karma, how we find the people who shape our lives\nis a wonderful mystery. I\u2019ve benefited from the attention and care of many\ngood mentors. Professor Barbara Rosenkrantz shared her excitement in\nbringing radical curiosity to musty historical documents. Phil Isenberg,\nCarolynn Maltas, John Gunderson, and an army of wonderful clinical\nteachers taught me to bring that same curiosity to the life stories of the people\nwho come to my office seeking relief from mental suffering. Avery Wiseman\nwas a model of the psychoanalyst-scholar, and Tony Kris and George\nFishman helped me find the courage to fit clinical practice and empirical\nresearch into the same satisfying workdays. Dan Buie and Jil Windsor are\nrare souls who make people feel truly seen and, in the process, bring out the\nbest in them\u2014including me.\nOver the past four decades, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of working with several\nhundred young adults as they train to become psychiatrists, and our shared\npassion for what makes people tick gives me hope for a future where there\nwill always be someone to talk to. Every day I meet with people in my\npsychotherapy practice, and their courage in sharing their deepest concerns\nas they face life\u2019s difficulties has shown me that the paths to a good and rich\nlife are practically infinite.\nZen meditation is another way in which I explore the experience of being\nhuman, and it has been life-altering. My fellow Zen teachers, David Rynick\nand Michael Fieleke, show me what it means to be present fearlessly for\none\u2019s life moment after moment. And in giving me dharma transmission, my\nteacher Melissa Blacker entrusted me with an invaluable and timeless tool\nfor waking up to life that I aspire to bring to everything I encounter.\nThe Psychiatry Department at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston\ncontinues to be the professional home of my research, teaching, and writing.\nMaurizio Fava, Jerry Rosenbaum, and John Herman are among the many\npeople who make it exciting and gratifying to be part of this community of\nclinician-scholars, along with the faculty of the Program in Psychodynamics.\nJohn Makinson brought his droll wisdom and vast publishing experience\nto this new phase of our fifty-year friendship that never ceases to surprise\nand delight me. Arthur Blank understood that I needed to write this book  long\nbefore I knew it\u2014insisting in his gracious and generative way that the\ninsights we\u2019d shared in academic journals should be brought to broader\naudiences. John Bare had the clear vision of how that could happen.\nThe family I was born into had everything to do with shaping me and this\nbook . My father, David, was the most curious person I\u2019ve ever known\u2014\nendlessly fascinated by the experiences of everyone who crossed his path.\nMy mother, Miriam, demonstrated empathy and connection in everything she\ndid, and my brother, Mark\u2019s, mind for family history was a lesson in the\nvalue of tracking where we\u2019ve been in life. For thirty-six years my wife,\nJennifer Stone, has been the center of my world\u2014a  wise advisor on clinical\nmatters, a careful editor, a willing playmate, and a partner who makes\nparenting a joyful collaboration. My two sons teach me, tease me, and keep\nme humble\u2014Daniel with an analytic mind that sometimes makes my jaw\ndrop, and David with playful energy and keen insights that keep refreshing\nmy views of the world.\nAnd of course, my coauthor, Marc Schulz. The story of our friendship is\nrecounted in the book , but it doesn\u2019t do justice to three decades of weekly\nmeetings, family visits, and travel to conferences around the world. A typical\nweekly phone call will range from talking about our kids\u2019 challenges at\nschool, to discussing a puzzling clinical situation, to finding the best\nstatistical techniques for analyzing the link between childhood trauma and\nadult health. Finding a friend whose skills complement and extend my own is\nprobably a once-in-a-lifetime event\u2014and a stroke of good fortune that I\nnever take for granted.\nThese are the people who remind me every day that a good life can be\nbuilt with good r elationships.\nMarc\nThe Good Life was literally built on the connections we have been lucky\nenough to have throughout our lives. I grew up with the support of loving\nparents and grandparents who encouraged me to explore and find joy in the\nworld. My mother is an accomplished photographer who taught me the value\nof attentively watching and listening to others and the excitement that comes\nwith creative pursuits. She also showed me the pleasure one can get from\nteaching and mentoring others. My father shared with me his fierce appetite\nfor learning and using knowledge to understand events in our own lives and\nbeyond, as well as the benefits of enjoying life\u2019s silly moments. I have also\nbeen blessed by incredibly supportive, accepting, and loving stepparents\nwho enriched my life immeasurably.\nMy grandparents, especially Gladys and Hank, were towering figures for\nme growing up, and I am grateful for their encouragement and belief in me.\nMy parents and grandparents, each in their own way, have provided valuable\nmodels for how to cope with life challenges and how to prioritize\nrelationships. I am also lucky to have three extraordinary siblings who have\ngiven me the opportunity to learn about family and life from different\nperspectives. Julie, Michael, and Suzanne, thank you, for your support and\nfor always being there.\nClose friends from childhood and college have shown me both the value\nof strong connections and the ways they can be sustained across geographical\nbarriers and life circumstances. David Hagen, whom I miss terribly, is an old\nfriend who truly embodied what it meant to be a connector and a life-\naffirming friend.\nI began my formal study of the good life as a college student exploring\nideas from sociology, anthropology, political theory, and philosophy at a time\nwhen I was really just trying to figure out my own path. Professors Jerry\nHimmelstein and George Kateb patiently helped me figure out how to unlock\nmysteries in what I was reading and pushed me to think in new and\ninteresting ways.\nDespite my own uncertainty at the time, I decided to study clinical\npsychology at the University of California at Berkeley. With hindsight, this\nwas one of the great decisions of my life. I began to learn about human\nthriving and struggling in new ways. Working with clients and figuring out the\nbest ways I could help them with their goals helped me grow in ways for\nwhich I am forever grateful. I owe deep thanks to a series of remarkable\nmentors and clinical supervisors during graduate school and subsequent\nclinical training. Phil and Carolyn Cowan were critically important mentors\nwho taught me so much about research, clinical work, relationships, and life,\nincluding the true value of listening and being curious about the experiences\nof others. Dick Lazarus was an unusually incisive and creative thinker. He\nand the Cowans showed me how to research hard-to-quantify, central\nelements of our lives like emotion and relationships. The wisdom of these\nand many other teachers permeates the pages of this book .\nI have called Bryn Mawr my academic home for more than twenty-five\nyears, and I am enormously privileged to be part of such a vibrant and\nsupportive community of learning. I am grateful to colleagues within and\noutside the Psychology Department for their support and their commitment to\nteaching, learning, and research. Kim Cassidy has been a colleague for my\nentire journey at Bryn Mawr, and I am thankful for her support,\nencouragement, and friendship throughout these years. Collaborations outside\npsychology with Michelle Francl, Hank Glassman, and Tim Harte have\nexpanded my thinking and helped inform ideas that we present in this book .\nOver the years, I have had the pleasure of teaching and working closely\nwith hundreds of extraordinary students at all levels of training. My\nconnections with students have enriched my life in ways that are hard to\ndescribe. I thank all of you, especially the undergraduate and graduate\nstudents who have done research with me and helped spark new ideas or\nsharpen old ones. A special thank you to Kate Petrova, with whom I had the\npleasure of working for almost five years and who has helped me refine my\nthinking about many of the ideas presented in the book . Kate also helped plan\nthe next phase of research for the Harvard Study. Mahek Nirav Shah played\nan important role in organizing materials and extracting life histories for this\nbook .\nWorking on this book  with Bob has been a true pleasure much like all of\nthe collaborations and adventures we have engaged in over almost three\ndecades. Bob has a combination of smarts, insightfulness, creativity,\nkindness, and competence that is truly breathtaking. I feel so fortunate that we\nhave been friends and workmates for so long. Ours is a collaboration and\nfriendship through which I have no doubt that we have reached heights\ntogether I certainly would not be capable of if I journeyed alone.\nMy wife and two sons mean the world to me. They give my life layers of\nmeaning and joy that make me feel very, very lucky. Jacob and Sam have\nalways been the best distraction from work the world has ever created. They\nhave grown into kind and thoughtful young men that fill my wife and me with\njoy and pride. Jacob has a deep interest in the experience of others and in big\nmoral and ethical questions, and I marvel at his gift at communicating\ncomplicated ideas. Sam notices patterns and connections that escape others\nand loves learning about the natural world in ways that are inspiring. My\nrelationships with them and the things they have taught me have made The\nGood L ife better.\nJoan has been a remarkable companion in life for more than three\ndecades. She has encouraged my pursuits, buoyed my confidence when it\nwavered, and brought more joy to my life than I deserve. Her kindness,\nintelligence, and common sense have all helped me focus on what is really\nimportant in life. Making a family with Joan has been the best project of my\nlife, and I look forward to navigating together whatever the rest of life has to\noffer.\nABOUT THE AUTHORS\n\u00a9 KATHERINE TAYLOR\nROBERT WALDINGER, MD, is professor of psychiatry at\nHarvard Medical School.

In a 2007 survey, millennials were asked: This survey information comes from Jean M.\nTwenge and colleagues (2012), \u201cGenerational Differences in Young Adults\u2019 Life Goals, Concern\nfor Others, and Civic Orientation.\u201d\n3. the good life unfolds, through time. It is a process: The psychologist Carl Rogers had a similar\nidea about the pursuit of a good life being a journey. In 1961, in On Becoming a Person (p. 186),\nhe wrote, \u201cThe good life is a process not a state of being. It is a direction, not a destination.\u201d\n4. the act of recalling an event can actually change our memory of it: Elizabeth Loftus at the\nUniversity of Washington has done extensive work in this area. For a profile of her, and a\nsummary of her papers on \u201cmemory distortion,\u201d see Nick Zagorski (2005), \u201cProfile of Elizabeth\nF. Loftus.\u201d\n5. Studies\u2026 come in two flavors: \u201ccross-sectional\u201d and \u201clongitudinal\u201d: Controlled experiments\nwith random assignment to different conditions are another critical method for understanding\nhuman health and behavior. Experiments typically unfold in short passages of time, but they can\nbe used to study some phenomena over longer periods.\n6. most successful prospective longitudinal studies maintain 30 to 70 percent of their\nparticipants: See Kristin Gustavson and colleagues (2012), \u201cAttrition and Generalizability in\nLongitudinal Studies.\u201d\n7. Ananya, from India: This is the only person in the book outside of the Harvard Study\nparticipants whose name is disguised. Like the Study participants, we changed her name to\nprotect her privacy.\n8. The British Cohort Studies: The Centre for Longitudinal Studies at University College London\nis the home of four of these five extraordinary studies (https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/). Science\njournalist Helen Pearson wrote an account of the British Cohort Studies in 2016: The Life\nProject.\n9. The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study: See Olsson and colleagues\n(2013), \u201cA 31-Year Longitudinal Study of Child and Adolescent Pathways to Well-Being in\nAdulthood.\u201d\n10. The Kauai Longitudinal Study: Emmy Werner (1993), \u201cRisk, Resilience, and Recovery.\u201d\n11. The Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study: John T.

The Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span: Tessa K. Novick\nand colleagues (2021), \u201cHealth-Related Social Needs.\u201d\n13. the Student Council Study: The original data and study materials were recently rediscovered\nand are being maintained by the Harvard Study of Adult Development in preparation for future\narchiving. The Student Council Study was planned and initiated by Earl Bond, MD, and continued\nby Rachel Dunaway Cox, PhD. Cox\u2019s 1970 book, Youth into Maturity, documents the study.\n14. In China, loneliness among older adults has\u2026 increased: Ye Luo and Linda J. Waite (2014),\n\u201cLoneliness and Mortality Among Older Adults in China.\u201d\n15. But what we find by looking at the entirety of research: Research from the Mills Study (R.\nHelson and colleagues, 2002, \u201cThe Growing Evidence for Personality Change in Adulthood\u201d)\nmentioned earlier in this chapter has provided evidence that personality continues to evolve in\nadulthood.\n16. You can be lonely in a crowd: John Cacioppo and William Patrick (2008), Loneliness: Human\nNature and the Need for Social Connection.\n17. The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the\nhealthiest\u2026 at age 80: See 2001 article by George Vaillant and K. Mukamal, \u201cSuccessful\nAging.\u201d\n18. Our most happily partnered men and women: See 2010 paper by Robert J. Waldinger and\nMarc S. Schulz, \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do with It?\u201d\n19. A few touchstone examples: For the HANDLS study, see Tessa K. Novick and colleagues\n(2021), \u201cHealth-Related Social Needs.\u201d For the CHASRS findings, see John T. Cacioppo and\ncolleagues (2008), \u201cThe Chicago Health, Aging, Social Relations Study.\u201d And for the Dunedin\nfindings, see Olsson and colleagues (2013), \u201cA 32-Year Longitudinal Study.\u201d\nChapter 2: Why Relationships Matter\n \n1. \u201cThe best ideas aren\u2019t hidden in shadowy recesses\u201d: Richard Farson and Ralph Keyes (2002),\nWhoever Makes the Most Mistakes.\n2. These feelings, big and small\u2026 feeling of stress: John T. Cacioppo and colleagues (2014),\n\u201cEvolutionary Mechanisms for Loneliness.\u201d\n3. Researchers at the University of Chicago turned their local train into an affective\nforecasting experiment: Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder (2014), \u201cMistakenly Seeking\nSolitude.\u201d\n4. There is a lot of research\u2026 human beings are bad at affective forecasting: See, for example,\nTimothy D. Wilson and Daniel T. Gilbert (2005), \u201cAffective Forecasting: Knowing What to\nWant\u201d; and Wilson and Gilbert (2003), \u201cAffective Forecasting.\u201d\n5. we pay a lot of attention to potential costs and downplay\u2026 potential benefits: Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky\u2019s seminal research and theory (\u201cProspect Theory\u201d) makes just\nthis point. Kahneman was recognized with a Nobel Prize for this research and theory. See Daniel\nKahneman and Amos Tversky (1979), \u201cProspect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk.\u201d\nSee also A. P. McGraw and colleagues (2010), \u201cComparing Gains and Losses\u201d; and Gillian M.\nSandstrom and Erica J. Boothby (2021) \u201cWhy Do People Avoid Talking to Strangers? A Mini\nMeta-analysis of Predicted Fears and Actual Experiences Talking to a Stranger.\u201d\n6. David Foster Wallace used a parable: Wallace\u2019s 2005 commencement address to Kenyon\nCollege as quoted in \u201cDavid Foster Wallace on Life and Work,\u201d Wall Street Journal, September\n19, 2008.\n7. \u201cThe life of money-making is one undertaken under compulsion\u201d: Aristotle wrote this in\nchapter 5 of Nicomachean Ethics in 350 BCE. The quotation can be found online in a translation\nby W. D. Ross here: http://classics.mit.edu//Aristotle/nicomachaen.html.\n8. \u201cMoney has never made man happy, nor will it\u201d: This quote from Benjamin Franklin appears\non page 128 of Samuel Austin Allibone\u2019s 1880 book, Prose Quotations from Socrates to\nMacaulay.\n9. \u201cDon\u2019t make money your goal\u201d: This quote from Maya Angelou was posted on her Facebook\npage on May 1, 2009.\n10. What We Talk About When We Talk About Money: Psychologist Abraham Maslow developed\na model of human needs, known as \u201cMaslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs,\u201d often represented by a\npyramid or triangle divided into five sections, with physiological needs like food, water, and rest at\nthe bottom, \u201cself-actualization\u201d at the very top, and \u201csocial belonging\u201d seated directly in the\nmiddle. While this model has been criticized for its emphasis on self-actualization, its perspective\nthat the most meaningful areas of life are dependent upon more basic needs has proven true over\nmany years of research. Any honest answer to the question What really matters? must first\naddress physiological needs and safety. We believe that Maslow\u2019s third tier, \u201csocial belonging,\u201d is\nin the proper place only in that it is at the center of everything.\n11. Angus Deaton and Daniel Kahneman\u2026 the relationship of money to happiness: See the\n2010 article by Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton, \u201cHigh Income Improves Evaluation of Life\nbut Not Emotional Well-being.\u201d\n12. $75,000 per year, which was close to the average family income in the U.S. at the time of\nthe study: Mean family income in the U.S. in 2010 when Kahneman and Deaton\u2019s study was\npublished was $78,180 according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis:\nfred.stlouisfed.org/series/MAFAINUSA646N.\n13. a basic amount of money allows people to\u2026 have some control over life: One notable\nexample regarding control at work, which is generally lower in lower-status jobs: the amount of\ncontrol one has over work schedules and wages was a major predictor of health disparities in the\nBritish Whitehall Longitudinal Studies. Workers with less control were sicker. See the 1997 paper\nby Michael G. Marmot and colleagues, \u201cContribution of Job Control and Other Risk Factors to\nSocial Variations in Coronary Heart Disease Incidence.\u201d See also Hans Bosma and colleagues\n(1997), \u201cLow Job Control and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease in Whitehall II (Prospective\nCohort) Study.\u201d\n14. cultures that vary in wealth: One notable study by Matthew Killingsworth challenges this\nconclusion. Reported well-being in this study continues to rise when income surpasses $75,000,\nbut to a substantially narrower degree with each increase. See Killingsworth (2021) and Kieran\nHealy (2021).\n15. \u201cMore money does not necessarily buy more happiness\u2026 emotional pain.\u201d: See Kahneman\nand Deaton (2010).\n16. \u201cbadges of ability\u201d: Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb (1972), The Hidden Injuries of\nClass.\n17. the more we compare ourselves to others\u2026 the less happy we are: See the 2015 paper by\nPhilippe Verduyn and colleagues, \u201cPassive Facebook Usage Undermines Affective Well-being:\nExperimental and Longitudinal Evidence.\u201d Also see Judith B. White and colleagues (2006),\n\u201cFrequent Social Comparisons and Destructive Emotions and Behaviors: The Dark Side of Social\nComparisons.\u201d\n18. Reinhold Niebuhr\u2019s \u201cSerenity Prayer\u201d: A version of this prayer is now commonly used in\nAlcoholics Anonymous and other twelve-step programs.\n19. startling and influential paper published in the journal Science: See the article by James S.\nHouse and colleagues (1988), \u201cSocial Relationships and Health.\u201d\n20. Blacks had a higher risk of dying\u2026 though that difference was relatively small: These\ndisparities continue to exist. In the United States, whites live 3.6 years longer than Blacks (Max\nRoberts, Eric N. Reither, and Sojoung Lim, 2020, \u201cContributors to the Black-White Life\nExpectancy Gap in Washington D.C.\u201d). In the U.S., for individuals born in 2016, life expectancy\noverall is 78.7. In Finland, life expectancy is 81.4 These data come from:\ndata.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.FE.IN?end=2019&locations=FI&start=2001.\n21. another much larger study cemented the connection between relationships and risk of\nmortality: Julianne Holt-Lunstad and colleagues (2010), \u201cSocial Relationships and Mortality: A\nMeta-analytic Review.\u201d\n22. the leading cause of preventable death: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention\nand Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health: \u201cThe Health Consequences of Smoking\u2014\n50 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General.\u201d Atlanta: 2014.\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/50th-anniversary/index.htm\n23. study after study\u2026 continues to reinforce the connection between good relationships and\nhealth: In 2015, Julianne Holt-Lunstad and colleagues published another meta-analysis showing\nthat social isolation and loneliness were both associated with increased likelihood of mortality. See\nHolt-Lunstad and colleagues (2015), \u201cLoneliness and Social Isolation as Risk Factors for\nMortality: A Meta-analytic Review.\u201d\n24. regardless of a person\u2019s location, age, ethnicity, or background: Three research examples to\nillustrate the diversity of samples showing the association of social connections and health (both\nphysical and psychological):\nIn the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS)\nstudy in Baltimore with a cohort of 3,720 Black and White adults (aged 35\u201364),\nparticipants that reported receiving more social support also reported less depression.\nNovick and colleagues (2021), \u201cHealth Related Social Needs.\u201d\nIn the birth cohort study based in Dunedin, New Zealand, social connections in\nadolescence predicted well-being in adulthood better than academic achievement. Olsson\nand colleagues (2013), \u201cA 32-Year Longitudinal Study.\u201d\nIn the Chicago Health, Aging, and Social Relations Study (CHASRS), a representative\nstudy of Chicago residents, those who were in satisfying relationships reported higher\nlevels of happiness.

These findings are summarized in a 2018\narticle by Matthews and colleagues. It is important, of course, to note that these correlational\nfindings could also indicate that poorer coping strategies, mental health problems, and risky\nphysical health behaviors contribute to loneliness.

Thirty-one percent had a high school education or less, 29 percent were\npeople of color. See Shiri Cohen and colleagues (2012), \u201cEye of the Beholder: The Individual and\nDyadic Contributions of Empathic Accuracy and Perceived Empathic Effort to Relationship\nSatisfaction.\u201d\nChapter 6: Facing the Music: Adapting to Challenges in Your Relationships\n \n1. \u201cThere is a crack, a crack in everything\u201d: This lyric is from Leonard Cohen, the musician and\npoet. It can be found on Cohen\u2019s (1992) Anthem, track 5, on Leonard Cohen, The Future album.\nCohen\u2019s lyric has many precursors, and probably originates with Ralph Waldo Emerson: \u201cThere is\na crack in every thing God has made,\u201d from Essays, p. 88.\n2. \u201cThere are two pillars of happiness\u2026 does not push love away\u201d: George Vaillant, Triumphs\nof Experience, p. 50.\n3. Many studies have shown that when we avoid confronting challenges\u2026 it can get worse:\nTwo examples of relevant research are Shelly L. Gable (2006), \u201cApproach and Avoidance Social\nMotives and Goals\u201d; and E. A. Impett and colleagues (2010), \u201cMoving Toward More Perfect\nUnions.\u201d\n4. we used data from the Harvard Study and asked\u2026 face difficulties directly: We describe\nthis research in Waldinger and Schulz (2010), \u201cFacing the Music or Burying our Heads in the\nSand,\u201d along with other relevant research.\n5. there are advantages to being flexible: Richard S. Lazarus (1991), Emotion and Adaptation,\nprovided a compelling and influential argument that all efforts at responding to challenges must be\nmatched to the demands of the situation. George Bonanno\u2019s research and ideas have also spoken\neloquently to the advantages of responding to challenges in flexible ways. See, for example,\nBonanno and Burton (2013) and Bonanno and colleagues (2004). Building on Lazarus\u2019s and\nBonanno\u2019s ideas, we (Dworkin and colleagues, 2019) have provided evidence linking flexible\ncoping when discussing relationship challenges with relationship satisfaction.\n6. the connection between how we perceive events and how we feel about them: For a more\nthorough discussion of this idea, see Lazarus (1991) and Moors and colleagues (2013).\n7. \u201cMen are disturbed not by events, but by the views they take of them\u201d: This quotation from\nEpictetus was written in AD 135 in the Enchiridion.

The W.I.S.E.R Model of Reacting: The model we present builds on existing models of emotion\nand coping with challenges including important work by Lazarus and Folkman (1984) and Crick\nand Dodge (1994).\n10. Emotion is usually a sign that there is something important going on: This idea comes from\nseveral influential theories of emotion, including Lazarus\u2019s (1991) seminal work. See also Schulz\nand Lazarus (2012) for a summary of these ideas.\n11. \u201cThe world we live in\u201d: See Shohaku Okumura, Realizing Genjokoan: The Key to Dogen\u2019s\nShobogenzo.\n12. self-distanced reflection can shed new light on old stories: The benefits of self-distancing\nhave been explored in a number of research studies by Ethan Kross and Ozlem Aduk.

The mere thought of a person who is important to us can generate chemicals\u2026 other body\nsystems: Research supporting this conclusion comes from a variety of sources including basic\nresearch linking thinking to emotions and emotional arousal (e.g., Smith, 1989). Also see work by\nKrause and colleagues (2016) linking physiological reactions in mothers to thinking about\nindividuals in interpersonal contexts.\n9. emotions are a signal that there are matters of significance to us at play: See Lazarus\n(1991).\n10. We investigated the link between emotion and relationship stability: Research summarized in\nWaldinger and colleagues (2004).\n11. The fact that raters with no special knowledge of psychology\u2026 most adults have a facility\nto accurately read emotions: In this study, we also compared combined aggregates of our\n\u201cnaive\u201d raters to expert emotion coders and found a very high correspondence between the\nratings from these two sources.\n12. A Fear of Differences: Most of the relevant research and thinking about the role of differences\nin causing strong emotions in couples comes from work on couples therapy. See, for example,\nwork by Sue Johnson (2013), Daniel Wile (2008), and Schulz, Cowan, and Cowan (2006).\n13. a key lesson of the Harvard Study\u2026 relationships (and especially intimate relationships) play a\ncrucial role in how satisfied we are at any particular moment in life: For a discussion of the\nconnection between relationship satisfaction and overall satisfaction in life over time, see\nMcAdams and colleagues (2012) article from the longitudinal study, the British Household Panel\nSurvey.\n14. Life changes of all kinds can cause stress in our intimate partnerships. Even positive\nchanges: In 1967, Thomas Holmes and Richard Rahe developed a scale to measure the stress\nassociated with life changes. It included events like getting married, starting a new job, becoming\npregnant, experiencing the death of a close friend, and retirement. They gave each event a score\nof \u201clife change units\u201d from 0\u2013100, and they found that people with higher total life change scores\nhad more physical illness. This scale has been used across many cultures and in a number of\ndifferent populations, and it\u2019s proven useful over the years. The remarkable thing is that the scale\nis not based on how \u201cnegative\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d an event is, but rather on the amount of change it\ncauses.\n15. Many studies, including our own, show that there is often a decline in relationship\nsatisfaction after the birth of a child: See, for example, Schulz, Cowan, and Cowan (2006).\n16. There is no remedy for love but to love more: This quote comes from Thoreau\u2019s Journal I,\npage 88 (July 25, 1839).\n17. technique that shares much in common with mindfulness\u2026 research showing its utility: See,\nfor example, Kross (2021) and Kross and Ayduk (2017). For research connecting self-distancing\nand mindfulness, see Petrova and colleagues (2021).\nChapter 8: Family Matters\n \n1. \u201cCall it a clan\u201d: This quotation comes from Jane Howard\u2019s 1998 book, Families (p. 234).\n2. Lowell Street (now Lomasney Way): See Levesque, \u201cThe West End Through Time.\u201d Many of\nour participants\u2019 neighborhoods in the West End and other areas of Boston were bulldozed during\nthe period of urban renewal that began in the 1950s, and no longer resemble the places they once\nwere. See the following for a good description of changes in the West End across time:\nhttp://web.mit.edu/aml2010/www/throughtime.html.\n3. ongoing debate in the field of psychology. Some believe that early family experience\ndetermines who we become: Sigmund Freud and many of his psychoanalytic followers famously\nemphasized the role of early childhood experiences in shaping adult personality and functioning.\nA 1998 book by Judith Rich Harris (The Nurture Assumption: Why Children Turn out the Way\nThey Do) ignited a public debate about the degree to which early childhood environments shape\nlater functioning by claiming that most of this connection between early childhood environments\nand later functioning can be accounted for by genetic influences. Advocates on both sides of this\nissue continue to debate this issue.\n4. \u201cNo man is an island\u201d: This quotation from John Donne can be found on pp. 108\u20139 of\nDevotions Upon Emergent Occasions: Together with Death\u2019s Duel.\n5. In ancient China, the idea of family\u2026 this model remains strong in China today: See, for\nexample, Huang and Gove (2012).\n6. \u201cBallroom culture\u201d: Marlon M. Bailey, Butch Queens Up in Pumps.\n7. \u201cIn general\u2026 society at large\u201d: Marlon M. Bailey, Butch Queens Up in Pumps, p. 5.\n8. Regardless of our current lives, we still carry the ghosts of our childhoods: Selma Fraiberg,\nan American psychoanalyst and social worker, wrote an influential (1975) article, entitled \u201cGhosts\nin the Nursery,\u201d about the influence of childhood legacies.\n9. In 1955, a developmental psychologist named Emmy Werner: Emmy Werner and Ruth S.\nSmith summarize this research in two books, Overcoming the Odds: High Risk Children from\nBirth to Adulthood (1992); and Journeys from Childhood to Midlife: Risk, Resilience, and\nRecovery (2001).\n10. \u201c[The participants] were children and grandchildren of immigrants\u2026 a small group of\nAnglo-Saxon Caucasians\u201d: Emmy E.

Any excuse to gather the family together\u2026 lower rates of substance abuse, teen pregnancy,\nand depression: These findings are summarized in Anne Fishel (2016), \u201cHarnessing the Power\nof Family Dinners to Create Change in Family Therapy.\u201d\n15. adults in the U.S. eating about half of their meals alone: Reported by Ellen Byron (2019),\n\u201cThe Pleasures of Eating Alone.\u201d\n16. Family stories are important for bonding and maintaining connections: Barbara Fiese\ndiscusses the value of family storytelling and other rituals in a 2006 book, Family Routines and\nRituals, and in a 2002 article written with colleagues.\nChapter 9: The Good Life at Work: Investing in Connections\n \n1. \u201cJudge each day\u201d: The origins of this quote are disputed. It is often attributed to the nineteenth-\ncentury Robert Louis Stevenson, but it more likely came a bit later from William Arthur Ward.\nStevenson\u2019s version is often quoted as, \u201cDon\u2019t judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the\nseeds that you plant.\u201d See the following for a discussion of the origin of this quote:\nquoteinvestigator.com/2021/06/23/seeds/#note-439819-1.\n2. On average, workers in the United Kingdom do not work the most hours\u2026 (belongs to\nGermany): Charlie Giattino and colleagues (2013), \u201cWorking Hours.\u201d\n3. By the time the average individual in the U.K. reaches 80 years of age\u2026 (13 years!) at\nwork: Time-use surveys have been completed in many countries. In the U.S. the Bureau of\nLabor Statistics regularly measures the amount of time people spend on various activities as part\nof their American Time Use Survey (ATUS). These time-use surveys are often used as raw data\nfor calculating estimates of total time spent in activities across the lifespan. These estimates vary\ndepending on the exact data used and the method employed for projections. The illustration we\nused comes from a post by Gemma Curtis in 2017 (and last modified in April 2021).\n4. 63 percent of all Americans age 16 and over are part of the paid labor force: U.S. Bureau\nof Labor Statistics (retrieved October 2021), data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000.\n5. He conducted a study to try to quantify the effects of a difficult workday: This study is\nsummarized in Schulz and colleagues (2004), \u201cComing Home Upset: Gender, Marital Satisfaction\nand the Daily Spillover of Workday Experience into Marriage.\u201d\n6. trying to ignore the emotions or hide them\u2026 often increases their intensity and our body\u2019s\narousal: James Gross and colleagues have conducted important research studying the impact on\nthe body of hiding emotions from others. See, for example, Gross and Levenson (1993) and\nGross (2002). The research indicates that when individuals actively try to hide emotion from\nothers their cardiovascular system shows signs of arousal and they sweat more (another sign of\ninternal physiological arousal). There is other research (e.g., Hayes and colleagues, 2004)\nindicating that repeated attempts to ignore or avoid strong negative emotions often result in\nincreases in those emotions and related difficulties.\n7. It\u2019s inevitable that we will have hard days at work: Some people, because of their social or\neconomic status, may have a greater vulnerability to the spillover of negative effects from work\nto well-being. A 2020 study by Rung and colleagues in Louisiana, for example, suggests that\nBlack women may be particularly vulnerable to spillover of work into family life.\n8. The North End was a heavily Italian neighborhood: For a history of the Italian immigrant\nexperience in Boston, see Stephen Puleo (2007), The Boston Italians.\n9. loneliness increases our risk of death as much as smoking or obesity: See conclusions in\nmeta-analytic review by Julianne Holt-Lunstad and colleagues in 2010.\n10. Gallup has conducted workplace engagement polls\u2026 Do you have a best friend at work?:\nAnnamarie Mann (2018), \u201cWhy We Need Best Friends at Work.\u201d\n11. people who have a best friend at work are more engaged: See findings reported by\nAnnamarie Mann (2018) for Gallup and a 1995 study by Christine Riordan and Rodger Griffeth\nexamining links between friendship opportunities and job satisfaction and engagement.\n12. Positive relationships at work lead to lower stress levels\u2026 make us happier: See Mann\n(2018), article by Adam Grant (2015) in The New York Times, and Riordan and Griffeth\u2019s 1995\nstudy.\n13. Mary Ainsworth\u2026 had her own encounters with sexism in the workplace: Mary Ainsworth\nwrote about these and other life experiences in a chapter in Agnes N. O\u2019Connell and Nancy\nFelipe Russo, eds. (1983), Models of Achievement: Reflections of Eminent Women in\nPsychology.\n14. women\u2019s roles in the workforce have changed\u2026 roles in the home: These trends are\ndocumented in Arlie Hochschild\u2019s (1989/2012) book, The Second Shift. See also the 2000\nreview by Scott Coltrane documenting similar trends and inequities.\n15. time burdens in the home still weigh more heavily on the woman: See, for example, work by\nBianchi and colleagues in 2012.\n16.

For example, female participants, on average, expected\nslightly more out of their friendships than male participants, but the difference was small enough\nthat the distributions for men and women overlap more than 85 percent.\n11. In one fascinating study\u2026 having a friendly moment with a stranger was uplifting: These\nfindings come from a 2014 study by Gillian M. Sandstrom and Elizabeth U.

The typical longitudinal study has a much higher dropout rate\u2026 entire lifetimes: In a 2012\nstudy, Kristin Gustavson and colleagues discuss attrition in longitudinal studies.\n2. Courses in social and emotional learning (SEL)\u2026 are being tested in schools all over the\nworld: Rebecca Taylor and colleagues review Socio-Emotional Learning interventions in a 2017\nmeta-analysis. Hoffman and colleagues discuss a leading example of SEL interventions in a 2020\narticle.\n3. Efforts to bring these same lessons to adults in organizations, workplaces, and community\ncenters are also under way: We (Bob and Marc) are involved in efforts to promote this kind of\nlearning with adults through our involvement with the Lifespan Research Foundation\n(https://www.lifespanresearch.org/). Building on the research cited in this book we have created\ntwo 5-session courses designed to help individuals lead happier and more satisfying lives. The\n\u201cRoad Maps for Life Transitions\u201d course (https://www.lifespanresearch.org/course-for-\nindividuals/) is designed for adults at all stages of life, while the \u201cNext Chapter\u201d course\n(https://www.lifespanresearch.org/next-chapter/) is especially designed for individuals between\nages 50 and 70.\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n \n1.

        "text": "To the Editors (Richard J. Harknett writes):\nIn \u201cDeterrence and Dissuasion in Cyberspace,\u201d Joseph Nye reveals the dif\u00aaculties in\napplying deterrence to cyberspace by extending the concept from its hard core of retal -\niatory dynamics and threat of denial to include entanglement (interdependence by\nanother name) and norms.1This extension of concept still leaves Nye apparently dis -\nsatis\u00aaed: he concludes that deterrence in the Cold War was not as good as scholars and\npolicymakers think it was, so perhaps they are holding cyber deterrence to an illusion -\nary standard. Essentially , Nye suggests that both scholars and policymakers should cut\ncyber deterrence a break.\nThe management of cyber aggression does indeed need a break: a sharp break away\nfrom deterrence-centric thinking. Nye\u2019s piece illustrates how we are facing a degenera -\ntive program moment or the friction one expects on the edge of a paradigm\u2019s need to\nshift.2The evidence from real-world security dynamics suggests that deterrence is the\nwrong framework for explaining cyber aggression and for formulating policy . Ratherthan contorting deterrence, we need a line of research outside the deterrence paradigm.In 1998, Nye and Sean Lynn-Jones urged security studies scholars to be open continu-ously to deep re\u00baection if they are to make a difference.\n3The dominance of deterrence\nthinking is blocking such re\u00baection and policy application.\nNye\u2019s article walks through the very real limitations of both retaliatory and denial-\nbased deterrent threats against cyber aggression. Punishment is made more dif\u00aacult by\nRichard J.

Harknett\nJoseph S. Nye Jr.Is Deterrence Possible in Cyberspace?\n196\nthe attribution problem, and denial is challenging because \u201ccyber defenses are notori -\nously porous\u201d and \u201coffense dominates defense\u201d (p. 56).\nIn short, if aggression sits below the threshold where serious military sanctions are\ncredible but above the level where it can be deterred through \u201cgood cyber hygiene\u201d(p. 57), the deterrence paradigm fails to address where recognizing security action istaking place.\n4But rather than recognizing these limitations as indicators that new con -\ncepts may be needed, Nye\u2019s response is to massage the retaliatory and denial problems\nand then suggest that interdependence and norms be reconceived as \u201cmeans of deter -\nrence and dissuasion.\u201d In doing so, he reduces their considerable potential as stand-\nalone approaches. For example, he notes that breaking norms can lead to \u201creputationalcosts,\u201d when denial fails (p. 60). But this is just the threat of punishment repackaged,which can succeed only if others impose costs through some behavioral change becauseof the aggressor\u2019s poor reputation. The actions of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria\u2019sbrutal civil war may have damaged Assad\u2019s reputation, but unless states change theirbehavior toward Assad because of his reputation for violating norms (essentially exact -\ning a cost from him), the norm against mass murder counts for little. The causal factor\nhere for Nye that might lead to deterred behavior remains not norms but retaliation,which Nye has already said should not be the basis for deterrence in cyberspace.\nWhat Nye actually wants is \u201cto reduce and prevent adverse actions in cyberspace\u201d\n(p. 54). This worthy goal does not, and need not, equate with deterrence. Retaliationand denial are tools different from defense, entanglement, and norms. They are alsodistinct from counter capability and operations offense, compellence, and other non-deterrence security approaches that can challenge, reduce, and manage but not neces-sarily deter adverse actions. Once one maps national security goals to the reality ofcyber operations, deterrence theory becomes more of an impediment than a stimulus tothinking about strategy .\nNye quotes Jon Lindsay\u2019s \u00aanding that \u201cdeterrence works where it is needed most,\nyet it usually fails everywhere else\u201d (p. 18), which implies that acts that might cross aclear traditional threshold are strategically relevant and \u201ceverywhere else\u201d is not. Infact, \u201ceverywhere else\u201d is fast becoming strategically relevant space. Cyberspace pro -\nvides a new seam for traditional great power competition, the intensity of which will\nonly increase as cyber actors leverage machine learning and arti\u00aacial intelligence tech -\nnology developments. If one examines the writings of Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov\nand the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army\u2019s notions of informationized war,\n5it be -\ncomes clear that certain actors see cyberspace as a strategically salient vector for achiev -\ning their goals below the traditional deterrence/war threshold.\nWe must examine the dynamics of the cyber domain if we are to provide policies to\nsecure it. Cyber deterrence thinking seems to block this effort. Every policy documenton cyberspace begins with the notion that it is interconnected\u2014and yet we declare it amilitary domain, rather than a domain in which the military must operate simulta -Correspondence: Is Deterrence Possible in Cyberspace? 197\n4. In fact, the deterrence paradigm distorts policy: despite the actions of adversaries, the United\nStates has pursued a \u201cdoctrine of restraint.\u201d See U.S. Department of Defense, The Department of De -\nfense Cyber Strategy (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Defense, April 2015), p. 6.\n5. Charles K. Bartles, \u201cGetting Gerasimov Right,\u201d Military Review , V ol. 96, No. 1 (January/\nFebruary 2016), pp. 30\u201338; and Larry M. Wortzel, \u201cThe Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army and In -\nformation Warfare\u201d (Carlisle, Pa.: Army War College Press, 2014).\nneously with allies, adversaries, the business sector, and individuals. Interconnected -\nness means that national security actors are in constant contact with other players and,\nunlike in strategic environments in which deterrence might succeed, it suggests thatstrategy must assume that contact and action are never absent.\nAt the tactical level, the \u201cterrain\u201d of cyber engagement is constantly changing. This is\nhuman-created space, and every new software version, platform, user interface, andprocess shifts that terrain. It is perpetually under construction.\nSo what if the systemic structure of interconnectedness, the condition of constant\ncontact, and the shifting nature of terrain combine to produce a distinct dynamic: of -\nfense persistence\u2014a strategic environment characterized by actors with continuous\nwillingness and capacity to produce security challenges? Security could then not beachieved in the absence of action. It would rest in challenging others\u2019 pursuit of cyberinitiatives through a comprehensive operational approach encompassing resiliency , ac -\ntive defense, and offense. Security would be advanced when one anticipates the exploi -\ntation of one\u2019s own vulnerability , while anticipating the vulnerabilities of others.\nDeterrence does not explain how one organizes strategically relevant action in such acontinuously active space.\nThe persistence of offense does not mean that security studies scholars and policy-\nmakers should despair; however, using a legacy construct of deterrence, whose meas-ure of effectiveness is the absence of action, to explain an environment of constantaction will not prevent adverse actions in cyberspace for many of the reasons that Nyehimself outlines. Let us take the critique Nye offers us, not to resuscitate and stretch de-terrence thinking, but to logically and creatively move beyond it.\n\u2014Richard J. Harknett\nCincinnati, Ohio\nJoseph S. Nye Jr. Replies:\nI am grateful to Richard Harknett for his thoughtful response to my article about deter -\nrence and dissuasion in cyberspace.1We agree that classical Cold War deterrence theory\nis not a good approach to thinking about how to reduce and prevent adverse actionsin cyberspace. As I say in the article, the aim in nuclear deterrence is total preven -\ntion, whereas many aspects of cyber behavior are more like other behaviors, such as\ncrime, that we try imperfectly to deter. Moreover, attribution is generally less complexin nuclear events. Preventing harm in cyberspace involves four complex politicalmechanisms: threats of punishment, denial, entanglement, and norms.\nI disagree, however, that there should be a \u201csharp break away from deterrence-\ncentric thinking.\u201d Harknett praises my criticisms of \u201cretaliatory and denial-based deter -\nrent threats against cyber aggression.\u201d My view is that we should reformulate these as -\npects of deterrence, but not discard them. Instead we should realize that the complex\npolitical processes of dissuasion require us to add the dimensions of entanglement andnorms because of the interconnectedness of cyberspace that he cites. He makes theInternational Security 42:2 198\n1. Joseph S.

More import-antly, it is about creating a detailed plan and optimiz-ing for success, based on an understanding of what works.\nFor the last few years this system has \nworked very well for me. My hope is that you will find it useful as well.\nMany of the ideas here are not original to \nme. This guide builds off many hours of reading many articles and blogs about pro-ductivity, goals, and the brain, which are at-tributed when possible.\n1\nThe end result is a system for keeping your-self constantly moving towards your goals over the next year, and constantly staying on track.\n1 A big early influencers is Chris Guillebeau who has \nwritten about his yearly planning process .WhY plAn A t All?\nWant to learn an instrument? Want to write a book? Want to beat every computer game ever designed? Want to cure can-cer? Want to have a positive impact on the world and an impactful career? Do you have \nsomething to protect , something that gets \nyou out of bed in the morning?\nWhatever your primary motivations are in \nlife, you won\u2019t get anywhere by waiting for something to happen. We plan because we have sh*t we want to do with our lives.\nHumans do not think strategically by de-\nfault. Even when we know what our goals are\u2014and we often don\u2019t\u2014we are still bad at asking things like:\n \u2799What exactly do I want to achieve?\n \u2799How will I measure success?\n \u2799Am I actively seeking out information about this?\n \u2799Can I break this down into more man -\nageable parts?\n \u2799Is this really my goal? Am I con -\nstrained by fears or uncertainties?\u201cNever put \noff till \ntomorrow \nwhat you \ncaN do the \nday after \ntomorrow.\u201d\nmark twaiN\n8,760 hours | 5Our brains are not optimized for achieving \nour larger goals in life. They are sculpted by \nevolution for survival and reproductive abil -\nities, but not much else!\nWe need systems and processes in place to help us get around these evolutionary \u201cabil-\nities\u201d so that we can get the most out of our lives.\nYour lIfe In A nutshell (\u201clIfe Is short\u201d)\nIf you live to be 80 years old, which is about the first-world average life expectancy, then you will experience about 30,000 days or 700,000 hours of life (if we take out sleeping time the number drops to more like 450,000 hours).\n2\nThe point is that we have limited time and we must choose how to spend it. Unfortu-nately, from personal experience, I rarely take the time to consciously do this.\nThe only way to decide what to work on is \nto prioritize . That\u2019s why I take a big picture \napproach to life and break down the big pic -\nture into present year and day actions.\nThis is part of my motivation for calling this \n2 See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy . \nI, for one, plan to live to be at least 1,000 years old, but \nthat\u2019s a story for a different guide.guide \u201c8,760 hours\u201d rather than \u201cone year.\u201d Even if there is a sense that life is incredibly short, there are still  8,760 hours in a single \nyear! That is a lot of time to get some real \nstuff done.\nGiven that our natural life-planning skills \nare\u2026 lacking, this guide hopes to help us overcome that limitation and get things done anyway.\nWe need specific goals and a concrete plan \nfor obtaining them that is optimized for success. We need a clear picture of our lives and where our priorities lie. What better time to do some fresh planning than at the start of a new year?\nthe problem WIth neW YeAr\u2019s resolutIons\nWe've all made them and we've all failed to achieve them. The number of times I've resolved to take up regular exercise or stop procrastinating\u2014and failed miserably\u2014is embarrassing.\nNew Year\u2019s resolutions often have at least \none of the following problems:\n \u2799They are vague, non-specific goals like \u201cbe fit,\u201d \u201cbe nice to people,\u201d or \u201cread more books.\u201d\n \u2799They are overly pessimistic and stem from self-critical admonitions for still not doing That Thing you always wanted to do or felt you ought to do\u2014\n\u201cI\u2019m such a slacker, but this year will be different.\u201d\n \u2799They take on too much at once\u2014\u201cI\u2019m committing to these ten big, vague, life-changing  things and start them all \non January 1st.\u201d\n \u2799They are not really your highest pri -\norities, and they inevitably fall to the wayside.\nThis guide outlines my process for avoid -\ning all of these shortcomings and trying to make some real changes over the next year.\nThe start of a new year is useful. There \ntends to be a positive \u201cchange can happen!\u201d atmosphere that explains why people make their new year\u2019s resolutions in the first place. A new year. A clean slate. A time to make some changes. Let\u2019s still do that, but \nlet\u2019s do it right .\nhoW to use thIs guIde\nI\u2019m going to illustrate what it is that I do, and I invite you to follow along.\nFirst I do an initial overview of my life. This \nhelps get the mind ready to do the whole process and starts me thinking about what \n8,760 hours | 6I\u2019m doing with my life, where my priorities \nare, what I want\u2014in general, and roughly \nover the next year.\nNext I review, in detail, the state of all \nareas of my life, and specifically any major \nprojects completed in the past year or still \nunderway.\nThen I spend some time thinking about the \nideal future\u2014how I want my life to look.\nFinally I extract from my ideals what I want \nto focus on for the next 8,760 hours (1 year) \nof my life, and optimize those plans for success by taking advantage of several mo-\ntivation and anti-procrastination tools and \ntricks.\nI try to spend at least a few days using this \nprocess at the end of every calendar year. The more time you spend on it the more \nvalue you will likely get out of it. Also, \nspreading it over several days gives the \nmind lots of time to process what it\u2019s think-\ning about, which I find useful.\nBefore we get started, I will mention what \nthis guide is not for:\n \u2799Determining what your bigger goals \nin life  should be\u2014this is something I \ncan\u2019t get into here, and something I highly recommend you spend some time thinking about if you haven\u2019t al -ready.\n \u2799An excuse when things don\u2019t work out. \u201cBut I tried. I even used this \nguide!\u201d You are responsible for your life; if things don\u2019t work out then fig -\nure out why and do something about \nit.\nThe number one way to use this guide wrong is to be dishonest with yourself, whether intentionally or accidentally. You need to be willing to face yourself, dirt and all. If you\u2019re not up for that, then file this guide away and continue on with life as you see fit.\nWho thIs Is for\nI\u2019m very analytic, and this guide strongly re-flects that. In the process of reviewing my past year and planning the upcoming year I break down my life into a bunch of areas, repeatedly mind map my goals and pro-jects in great detail, develop ways to track my progress, and try to optimize my life for success. \nThe whole process is very analytical and \nsystematic, and won\u2019t work for everybody. There is some risk with trying to optimize other peoples\u2019 lives, because we don't all \nwork the same. People are complex. This process, which I enjoy, might be unpleasant for you.\nBut even if you find specific parts of this \nguide useless, I believe you can still get some value out of it.\nA large part of the reason this works for me \nis because I enjoy using it. If you don\u2019t like \nusing your system then it will not survive for long. If at any point there is a part of the process that you do not want to do or would like to modify, then please do.\nNo matter what, do what works for you. The \nwhole point of this process is to help you get the most out of the next year. As you follow or deviate from this process, don\u2019t forget the reason why you\u2019re reading this in the first place\nA quIck personAl IntroductIon\nFor the purposes of this guide it is sufficient to say that I enjoy reading and thinking about various topics ranging from under-standing how our minds work, thinking clearly, improving productivity and organ-ization, maximizing my positive impact on the world, learning cool things, resolving internal conflicts, and generally improving my life as much as possible.\nLife is short, and I\u2019ll be damned if I don\u2019t at \n8,760 hours | 7least try to make the most of it. \nPlanning out my year and optimizing it for success are natural actions in the pursuit of my \ninterests.\nIf you want to know more, the best place is on my website (alexvermeer.com), which has a \nbunch of info on how I run my life, what major projects I\u2019m working on, and what I\u2019m cur -\nrently reading, among other things.\n\n8,760 hours | 8I The T ools\nBefore we go ahead and do \nany life planning we need some tools to help us out.\nThe process outlined in this guide is flex-\nible. You can easily adapt it to use whatever tools you prefer. I always require the fol-lowing:\n \u2799Pen and notebook\n \u2799Privacy\n \u2799Time\n \u2799Mind mapping software (optional)\nIf at any point in this guide you would rath -\ner use a different set of tools\u2014such as paper and pen rather than mind mapping soft -\nware\u2014then do it!\nA note on mInd mAppIng\nMind mapping consists of starting with a central idea in the middle of the page and branching out ideas from there. For ex-ample, the following two figures are of an early pen and paper mind map I made when outlining this guide and my review mind map from last year, respectively.For things like outlining, big picture think-ing, and connecting ideas, mind mapping is vastly superior to linear note taking, wheth -\ner it\u2019s with pen and paper or a software on your computer. \nPaper has the benefits of flexibility and \ncreativity, whereas software has the bene-fits of any electronic tool\u2014mobility, copy-ing and pasting, printing, resizing, easy scaling, etc.Some mind mapping software options are:\n \u2799Mindmanager by Mindjet \u2014expensive \nbut powerful. (This is my current pro -\ngram of choice, though I have some reservations.\n3)\n \u2799FreeMind\u2014open source and free.\n \u2799MindMeister \u2014free and online.\nYou must also be sure you will have enough time. As mentioned in the introduction, I \n3 Specifically, when I switched from Windows to OSX \nI discovered that the Mac version of Mindmanager is not \nas good as for Windows. Some key features I enjoyed using were missing, and it is all-around more buggy. Still powerful, but less good. Figure 1: A sample paper & pen mind \nmap\nFigure 2: A sample Mindmanager \nmind map\n8,760 hours | 9stretch out this process over at least a few \ndays to get the most out of it.\nthe tWel Ve lIfe AreA s\nOne last thing before we get to the core \ncontent of this guide.\nJust as an airplane has wings, engines, win-\ndows, controls, and landing gear, your life has various components. Ignoring some of them is like trying to fly without wings.\nThere are many ways to break down your \nlife into different \u201cbuckets.\u201d Over time I have collected and combined various meth -\nods and currently use twelve categories.\n4 \nValues & Purpose\nYour deeper, underlying, fundamental val -\nues and wants. Your philosophy of life. Your \nsense of purpose, vision, and meaning.\nContribution & Impact\nHow you give value to the world, make a \ndifference, and have a positive impact. \nLocation & Tangibles\nYour physical presence in the world. Where \nyou are in the world. Your living situation. Your stuff. What you own and why. Your material sufficiency. Your mobility. \n4 I keep an up-to-date list of these categories at https://\nalexvermeer.com/life-areas/.Money & Finances\nYour savings, investments, assets, and debt. \nHow your money is organization and man -\naged. Your inflows, budgets, and outflows.\nCareer & Work\nYour work, job, career, and business. Your \nposition, title, role, and responsibilities. Your source of income. \nHealth & Fitness\nYour eating habits, diet, exercise habits, and \nactivity levels. How resilient you are to sick -\nness. Your overall energy level. Your sleep-ing patterns and quality. Your major health issues and susceptibilities.\nEducation & Skill Development\nYour learning, education, and mental de-\nvelopment. Your talents and skills. Your skill development, practicing, and training.\nSocial Life & Relationships\nThe intimate relationship(s) you have or \nwant to have. The quality of your relation-ships. Your home life and relationships with family members. Your friend circles and social experiences. Your club, organization, and community memberships.\nEmotions & Well-Being\nYour general feeling about life, optimism or pessimism, positivity or negativity. Your \nemotional intelligence. Your subjective well-being, self-esteem, self-respect, and self-compassion.\nCharacter & Identity\nYour identity and model of yourself. Your \nstrengths and weaknesses, virtues and vices. Your intelligence, integrity, honesty, cour-age, compassion, honor, self-discipline, and so on.\nProductivity & Organization\nYour memorized solutions, daily routine, \nschedule, effectiveness, organization, and productivity. Your setup, systems, process -\nes, tools, and techniques.\nAdventure & Creativity\nYour hobbies, pastimes, and things you do \nfor fun and adventure. Your creativity and its expression.\nv  v  v\nYes, twelve is a lot of categories. Some of you may prefer a different breakdown.\n5 \nWhatever categories you choose to use, the \n5 For example, Chris Guillebeau's categories  or the \nones Steve Pavlina uses in his book : Habits & Daily \nRoutine, Career & work, Money & finances, Health & fitness, Mental development and education, Social life & relationships, Home & family, Emotions, Character & integrity, Life purpose & contribution, Spiritual development.\n8,760 hours | 10rest of the guide should be easily adaptable to suit.\nNote that certain aspects of your life will naturally overlap between the categories above. \nFor example, rock climbing has elements of Social (it is quite communal), Character (facing \nfears), Fitness (makes you stronger), and Adventure (because it\u2019s fun!). \nFor me, I climb because of how much fun it is, but I think of climbing as primarily great for \nmy mental and physical health, so I classify it under Health & Fitness . This overlap is perfectly \nokay.\nv  v  v\nNow that we have the tools we can begin the actual review and planning.\n\n8,760 hours | 11\nII a snapsho T of Your lIfe\nNow that we have the necessary tools in \nour toolbox, it's time to build a detailed picture of our life as it currently stands.\nthe InItIAl o VerVIeW\nPull out that pen and paper. To start, you want to get the brain \nthinking about this stuff by answering the following questions about the past year:\n1. What went well?\n2. What did not go well?\n3. Where did you try hard?\n4. Where did you not try hard enough?\nYou also want to ask the following questions about right now:\n \u2799What is the current situation here ?\n \u2799How do things stand right now?\n \u2799How would I summarize to a friend the status of this area?\nYou don't need to get into thorough detail yet, as that comes later.\nI spend at least a few minutes brainstorming (using mind maps) \nanswers to each of these questions. Once I have around ten items I move on\u2014they key here isn\u2019t to find 10 things, but to get all the \u201cobvious\u201d things out of your head, and quickly. gettIng specIfIc: Y our present \nreAlItY\nNow it's time to dive deep. For each of the areas we will map out a complete \u201cstatus report\u201d that includes an assessment of that area and any relevant information or metrics.\nFor example, for Career & Work I assess my current career, my \nstanding within the company, my options, and my passion for what I do.\nTo do this, I create a mind map with something like \u201cLife Status \u2013 \nEnd of 20 xx\u201d in the center with all of the life areas branching out, \nand then add as much detail as possible about that area. \nGeneral Questions & Prompts\n \u2799Detailed  answers to each of the questions at the start of this \nsection.\n \u2799A short paragraph summarizing your thoughts about that \narea of your life.\n \u2799Project status updates.\n \u2799Projects completed in the past year?\n \u2799Milestones from the past year?\n \u2799Important events from the past year?\n \u2799Accomplishments?\n \u2799Failures?\n8,760 hours | 12 \u2799Key life metrics such as income, qual -\nity of relationships, amount of dona -\ntions, etc.?\n \u2799Your overall rating for this area\n \u2799Strengths in this area? Weaknesses?\nFor many of these, such as the overall area \nrating and many of the key metrics, I like using a seven-level Likert Scale from 1 (very bad) to 7 (very good).\n6\nHamming Questions\nRichard Hamming  used to ask his co-work-\ners over lunch, \u201cWhat are the important \nproblems of your field?\u201d and then a while later ask \u201cWhat problems are you working on?\u201d and then a while later ask \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you working on the important problems?\u201d He soon found himself unwelcome at many lunch tables!\n7 \nThe general theme here is that we often know what problems in our lives are more important, yet we don\u2019t work on them! Here are some additional questions to ask of yourself, both for each life area, and also \n6 The full scale goes (1) very bad, (2) bad, (3) somewhat \nbad, (4) neither bad nor good, (5) somewhat good, (6) good, and (7) very good. If you want to keep things even simpler, consider using the five-level scale: very bad, bad, neutral, good, and very good. \n7 Hamming mentions this is his talk \u201c You and Your \nResearch .\u201d H/t to CFAR  for driving home how useful and \nimportant these questions are.your life as a whole:\n \u2799What is the most important problem here?\n \u2799What is my biggest bottleneck?\n \u2799What is most holding me back from achieving my full potential?\n \u2799What single thing, if successfully per -\nformed, would have the biggest impact here?\nAn example might be \u201csolve my bad sleep problems.\u201d If you have reasons to think you are not sleeping well\u2014sleep apnea, bad mat-tress, intermittent noise, etc.\u2014it seems real-\nly important to tackle this head-on as quickly as possible. Poor sleep has a significant ef-fect on your quality of life and your ability to do anything with your life. \nA Note about Judgements\nIt is important in this part of the process to \nbe objective and descriptive  about the world, \nwithout judgement. Don\u2019t ignore internal judgements when they pop up\u2014they inevit-ably will\u2014 but write them down separately for the next step of this process. I.e., get it out of your head, but then refocus on paint-ing the descriptive picture of your life. \nFor example, ideas and future plans often \npop into my head while doing this. Same with thoughts like \u201cugh, I really wish this part was better.\u201d I quickly jot these ideas down on a separate  piece of paper, for later \nreference, and then continue on with the current task.\nv  v  v\nAs you brainstorm for each of the life areas, review the descriptions outlined earlier. Also, feel free to use the following questions and metrics that I use in my review mind map.\nValues & Purpose\n \u2799Do I have a sense of purpose and dir -\nection in life?\n \u2799What do I want out of life?\n \u2799How do I want the world to be differ -\nent?\n \u2799What is my philosophy of life?\n \u2799What are my fundamental values?\n \u2799What do I truly value?\nContribution & Impact\n \u2799How am I giving value to the world? \nHow much value?\n \u2799How much money did I give away in the past year (assuming it made sense to do so)?

Once I\u2019ve gone through every area I do a \nsecond pass to catch the things I inevitably missed on the first pass.\nThe end result is a massive mind map with a complete picture of the current status of your \nlife. The following figure gives my Health & Fitness  review from last year as an example.\nWhen you are satisfied with your awareness of the present state of your life, you are ready to move on to planning.\n\n8,760 hours | 16III The nexT 8,760 hours\nNow that you have a good \nassessment of your present state of existence it is time to begin planning for the future as a whole, and spe-cifically the next year.\nYour IdeAl future\nThe first thing to do is to know what ideals \nyou are aiming for.\nI go through all areas of my life and re-\nview how I would want them to look in a perfectly ideal world. What kind of career would I have? How much money would I make? What would my social circles look like? How much positive impact would I have on the world? What important prob-lems would I have solved?\nI put all of this in a new mind map called \nFuture Vision and Goals.\n8\n8 If you've already done this before, now is a good time \nto review and update your \u201cideal future,\u201d but there may be no need to go through the entire exercise again.Since I have already done this for sev-eral years, nowadays I tend to review my existing mind map and make any changes as needed. Though, it is important to view information from previous years with fresh eyes, and keep only what is compelling and meaningful right now. \nDon\u2019t fill up a mind map with things you \nwould like, that would be nice. For example \ndon\u2019t put \u201cMake $1,000,000,000 per year\u201d\u2014unless that really is  a goal you\u2019re striving to \nreach.\nThe point isn\u2019t to think, \u201cWell, I might as \nwell set my ideal as having 1,000 cars.\u201d Rather, seriously ask yourself what you \nwant your life to look like! When you\u2019re done you should have a good sense of what the ideal you looks like. It should be full of big lofty goals and coolness, as well as small nudges and tweaks. \nSome questions to help you think about \neach life area:\n \u2799What do I want this to be like?\n \u2799What would be awesome? \u2799What would this look like if it was perfect?\n \u2799What is something I\u2019ve always wanted to do here?\n \u2799What would my ideal life look like?\n \u2799Are there any specific projects to fin -\nish or goals to accomplish in this area?\n \u2799if I were to die in a year, what would I do?\n \u2799if I were to die in 10 years, what would I do?\n \u2799For the metrics in each area, what do I ideally want them to be?\n \u2799If this area were improved, what would that look like?  I.e., make it vis-\nually concrete.\nthe next 8,760 hours\nNow it\u2019s time to start extracting what to do over the next year from your highest ideals and largest gaps.\nWhat will you do with the next 8,760 hours \nof your life? Not the next twenty years, not the next five years, but this coming year. \n8,760 hours | 17\nYearly Theme\nIt may help to start off with a theme in mind for the upcoming \nyear. This next year can be your \u201cYear of _______________.\u201d This could be a specific accomplishment (finish school, run a marathon) or a general goal (learn about cognitive psychology). \nFor example, my 2011 theme of the year was \u201cindependence\u201d be-\ncause I wanted to take a break from my job, do some backpacking in South America, become \u201clighter\u201d (sell or get rid of most of my possessions) and free myself from all debt.\n9\nHaving the theme helped remind me what I wanted the main thrust of my year to be.\nIf your life is in a state of flux or uncertainty then this may not be \nuseful. In the first few years of doing this, my yearly theme ended up having no bearing on my projects and actions; life was con-stantly changing, as were my interests and goals. If you expect that to happen to you, consider doing quarterly or monthly themes, or dropping this altogether. \nSetting a Focus\nThere are a lot of different aspects of your life. Any breakdown of \nlife areas could be broken down further if we wanted to, but then it may get unwieldy.\nWe have only a limited amount of time, so we need to decide what \nwe will focus on for the upcoming year.\nNow you should take some time to figure out what the most im-\nportant areas of your life you want to focus on in the next year. \nI like to rate each category out of seven in terms of importance. \n9 It was a resounding success!This should help give an idea of what parts you think are less ideal \nthan others.\nAlso, don\u2019t forget about the Hamming Questions  mentioned ear-\nlier, which can be very useful for identifying priorities and import-\nant focus areas.\nYour mA jor go Als\nDo you have any specific 1\u20132 year goals? Both a benefit and a flaw from picturing your ideal life is that it tends to lack concreteness. Goals tend to resemble new year\u2019s resolutions in that they are vague, non-specific, and hard to measure: \u201cregularly exercise,\u201d for example.\nGo through your mind map of your ideal life and extract some \nspecific important goals from it. List some key things that you want to do in the next year. Can they be organized into projects? Are they specific and measurable?\nWhat About Longer-Term Goals?\nAt least for the present, I am done with specific long-term goals. \nMy life is in too much flux to realistically plan what I'll be doing in next twenty years or even five years. My interests are too diverse to know how I will want to be spending my time five years from now. That said, I do still have some pretty specific medium-term goals \nfor the next year or two that I want to focus on.\nIf you have long-term goals that\u2019s fine, but you may want to break \nthem up into smaller major goals that can be completed in 1\u20132 years.\nNow that you have an idea of what you want to focus on next year, \nwhat are your most important major goals? Try to limit it to 3\u20135 \n8,760 hours | 18things. Remember, if you end up accom -\nplishing those over the next year then you \ncan always add more, but do not bite off more than you can chew.\nNow create a new mind map called Current \nMajor Goals and add your most important goals to it.\nSome examples of my major goals from pre-\nvious years:\nTravel\u2014Get off this continent and experi-ence another culture; expand my know-ledge and awareness of humanity; live out of my backpack; meet cool people; have fun. [Success! I backpacked through the highlands of Ecuador for seven weeks at the end of 2011.]\nWrite 100,000 words\u2014Get some practice \nwriting; complete NaNoWriMo; write \nregular blog posts.

The modalities are mapped to discrete tokens\nusing modality-specific tokenizers. The model can generate anyof the modalities from any subset of them.\nAbstract\nCurrent multimodal and multitask foundation models, like 4M [ 62] or Uni-\nfiedIO [ 59,58], show promising results. However, their out-of-the-box abilities to\naccept diverse inputs and perform diverse tasks are limited by the (usually small)\nnumber of modalities and tasks they are trained on. In this paper, we develop\na single any-to-any model trained on tens of highly diverse modalities and by\nperforming co-training on large-scale multimodal datasets and text corpora. This\nincludes training on images and text along with several semantic and geometric\nmodalities, feature maps from recent state of the art models like DINOv2 and\nImageBind, pseudo labels of specialist models like SAM and 4DHumans, and a\nrange of new modalities that allow for novel ways to interact with the model and\nsteer the generation, for example, image metadata or color palettes. A crucial step\nin this process is performing discrete tokenization on various modalities, whether\nthey are image-like, neural network feature maps, vectors, structured data like\ninstance segmentation or human poses, or data that can be represented as text.\nThrough this, we show the possibility of training one model to solve at least 3x more\ntasks/modalities than existing models and doing so without a loss in performance .\nIn addition, this enables more fine-grained and controllable multimodal generation\ncapabilities and allows studying the distillation of models trained on diverse data\nand objectives into one unified model. We scale the training to a three billion\nparameter and different datasets. The multimodal models and training code are\nopen sourced at https://4m.epfl.ch .\n*Equal contribution & corresponding authors.

Such a model, especially when capable of any-to-any predictions, brings notable\nadvantages, such as test-time computational efficiency, model size, and enabling modality fusion.\nHowever, multitask learning has commonly faced significant challenges. For example, the training\noften suffers from negative transfer, leads to reduction in performance compared to single-task\nmodels, and typically requires careful strategies for balancing losses or gradients [ 46,93,82,94,\n31]. Moreover, training a single network on tasks and modalities that vary greatly in terms of\ndimensionality, data type, and value ranges presents additional complexities\u2020. Recent notable efforts\nin the space of multimodal and multitask training, such as Pix2Seq [ 16,17], OFA [ 88], 4M [ 62], or\nUnified-IO [ 59,58] have made significant strides in unifying the representation space for conceptually\ndifferent inputs and targets. A large part of their success can be attributed to transforming different\nmodalities into a common representation, namely sequences of discrete tokens, and training relatively\nstandard Transformer architectures on them. While these works show promising results, they are\ntypically trained on a small set of modalities. This raises the question if increasing the set of\ntasks/modalities the models can solve will lead to a degradation of performance.\nWe build upon the multimodal masking pre-training scheme [ 62] and increase its capabilities by\ntraining on tens of highly diverse modalities. Concretely, we add SAM segments [ 47], 3D human\nposes and shapes from 4DHumans [ 35], canny edges extracted from RGB and SAM instances, color\npalettes, multiple types of image, semantic and geometric metadata, as well as T5-XXL [ 68] text\nembeddings, in addition to 7 more common modalities. On top of that, we include dense feature\nmaps of the recent state of the art models DINOv2 [ 65] and ImageBind [ 33], as well as their global\nembedding vectors to enable multimodal retrieval abilities. Please see fig. 1 for an overview.\nWe are able to train a single unified model on diverse modalities by encoding them with modality-\nspecific discrete tokenizers (see fig. 3). For image-like modalities, e.g. RGB or edges, we train\nViT-based [ 24] VQ-V AE [ 63] tokenizers to map the inputs into a small grid of discrete tokens.\nFor modalities like 3D human poses or image embeddings, we train MLP-based discrete V AEs to\ncompress them into a small set of discrete tokens. All other modalities that can be mapped to a text\nrepresentation, such as captions or metadata, are encoded using a WordPiece tokenizer [23].\nThe resulting model demonstrates the possibility of training a single model on a large number of\ndiverse modalities/tasks without any degradation in performance and significantly expands the out-of-\nthe-box capabilities compared to existing models. Adding all these modalities enables new potential\nfor multimodal interaction, such as retrieval from and across multiple modalities, or highly steerable\ngeneration of any of the training modalities, all by a single model.\nIn short, we expand the capabilities of existing models across several key axes:\n\u2022Modalities : Increase from 7 in the existing best any-to-any models [ 62] to 21 diverse\nmodalities, enabling new capabilities like cross-modal retrieval, controllable generation, and\nstrong out-of-the-box performance. This is one of the first times in the vision community\nthat a single model can solve tens of diverse tasks in an any-to-any manner (see fig. 2),\nwithout sacrificing performance and especially do so without any of the conventional\nmultitask learning difficulties [73, 46, 93, 82, 94, 31].\n\u2022Diversity : Add support for more structured data, such as human poses, SAM instances,\nmetadata, and color palettes for controllable generation.\n\u2022Tokenization : Investigate discrete tokenization of diverse modalities such as global image\nembeddings, human poses, and semantic instances using modality-specific approaches.\n\u2022Scale : Scale the model size to 3B parameters and dataset to 0.5B samples using [11].\n\u2022Co-Training : Demonstrate co-training on vision and language modeling simultaneously.\n\u2020Modality vs task: \u201cModalities\u201d usually denote the inputs to a model (e.g. sensory signals), and \u201ctasks\u201d\nusually denote the outputs (e.g. semantics). The adopted architecture in multimodal masked modeling enables a\nsymmetric input-output structure, thus modalities and tasks are used interchangeably in this paper.\n2\nthe view from the\ntop of <person>\nlookout\n<person> showing\nmountains as well\nas a family\nthe view from the\npier at the\nentrance of the sea\nthe view from the\ntop of the hill\nthe view from the\ntop of the\nmountain\nthe view from the\ntop of the lake\nwanaka lookout\nthe road to the\nmountains\nwalkability: 0.26\ng. complexity: 0.11\nclutter score: 74\n...\nwalkability: 0.12\ng. complexity: 0.43\nclutter score: 71\n...Humanposesthe streets of\nlisbon, portugalCLIP\nHumanposes\nwalkability: 0.06\ng. complexity: 0.03\nclutter score: 44\n...walkability: 0.14\ng. complexity: 0.04\nclutter score: 55\n...walkability: 0.00\ng. complexity: 0.17\nclutter score: 32\n...walkability: 0.18\ng. complexity: 0.17\nclutter score: 74\n...walkability: 0.16\ng. complexity: 0.15\nclutter score: 45\n...RGBInput PredictionsRGBCaption BoundingboxesSurfacenormalsDepthSemanticsegmentationBoundingboxesCaption DepthSemanticsegmentationDINOv2 ImageBind Metadata Canny SAM SAM Colorinstances\n palette edges edges\nwalkability: 0.08\ng. complexity: 0.04\nclutter score: 69\n...\nwalkability: 0.18\ng. complexity: 0.04\nclutter score: 65\n...\nwalkability: 0.48\ng. complexity: 0.01\nclutter score: 56\n...walkability: 0.32\ng. complexity: 0.01\nclutter score: 75\n...DINOv2the view from the\ntop of the\nmountain\nthe art of the\nlast of us part 2\nwalkability: 0.10\ng. complexity: 0.06\nclutter score: 75\n...MetadataCannyedgesthe blue lagoon\nthe turquoise\nlakes of the\ncanadian rockies\nwalkability: 0.16\ng. complexity: 0.18\nclutter score: 69\n...walkability: 0.06\ng. complexity: 0.11\nclutter score: 69\n...the view from the\nsummit of\nmount rundle\nthe hotel at\nloch lomond\nwalkability: 0.04\ng. complexity: 0.11\nclutter score: 36\n...Colorpalettethe three hills of\nthe ancient city\nof te anau,\nnew zealandSurfacenormalsImageBind CLIPSAMedgesSAMinstancesFigure 2: One-to-all generation. 4M-21 can generate all modalities from any given input modality and can\nbenefit from chained generation [ 62]. Notice the high consistency among the predictions of all modalities for\none input. Each row starts from a different modality coming from the same scene. Highlighted in green are new\ninput/output pairs that 4M [ 62] cannot predict nor accept as input. Note that, while this figure shows predictions\nfrom a single input, 4M-21 can generate any modality from any subset of all modalities .\n2 Method\nWe adopt the 4M pre-training scheme [ 62] as it has been shown to be a versatile approach that can be\nefficiently scaled to a diverse set of modalities. We keep the architecture and the multimodal masked\ntraining objective the same, but expand upon the model and dataset size, the types and number of\nmodalities with which we train the model, and train jointly on multiple datasets. All modalities are\nfirst transformed into sequences of discrete tokens using modality-specific tokenizers (See fig. 3).\nDuring training, random subsets of these tokens are selected from all modalities as inputs and targets,\nand the objective is to predict one subset from the other. We rely on pseudo labeling to create a large\npre-training dataset with multiple aligned modalities.\n2.1 Modalities\nWe train on a large and diverse set of modalities that we group into the following categories: RGB,\ngeometric, semantic, edges, feature maps, metadata, and text modalities. Below we provide a\nsummary of them (See fig. 1 and appendices D and E for details, and fig. 2 for generation examples).\nRGB: We include both tokenized and pixel versions of RGB images to facilitate transfer learning.\nWe also extracted their color palettes using PyPalette [ 2], at varying number of colors. This enables\nus to perform conditional generation using desired colors for better artistic control.\n3\nGeometric modalities: These contain surface normals ,depth , and 3D human poses &shape which\nprovide important information about the scene geometry. For the first two, we used Omnidata models\nfrom [ 26,44] for pseudo labeling due to their strong generalization performance. For 3D human\nposes and shape, we leverage a recent state-of-the-art model, 4D-Humans [35].\nSemantic modalities: We include semantic segmentation andbounding boxes to capture the scene\nsemantics and leverage Mask2Former [ 19] and ViTDet [ 54] models for pseudo labeling. Next to\nthese, we also incorporated pseudo labels extracted from Segment Anything Model [ 47] (SAM) as\nSAM instances for its strong object representation.\nEdges: As recent generative methods such as ControlNet [ 98] showed, edges carry important\ninformation about the scene layout and semantics that are also useful for conditioning, abstraction,\nand sketching. We consider two types of edges, specifically Canny edges andSAM edges . The\nformer is extracted from the RGB images with OpenCV [ 1]. As Canny edges may contain low-level\ninformation, e.g. shading edges, we also include edges extracted from SAM instances to get a more\nsemantic boundary map. We tokenize Canny and SAM edges with a shared tokenizer.\nFeature maps: We extract embeddings from CLIP [67],DINOv2 [65] and ImageBind [33] as they\ndemonstrated strong transfer learning and retrieval capabilities. Previously, tokenized CLIP features\nwere shown to be an effective target for masked image modelling [ 89,62] that enables distilling a\nuseful semantic representation of the scene. We follow a similar approach and tokenize the feature\nmaps from pre-trained CLIP-B16, DINOv2-B14 and ImageBind-H14 models. We also included the\nglobal embeddings of DINOv2 and ImageBind models and tokenized them separately.\nMetadata: We extract several useful pieces of information from the RGB images and other modalities,\nthat can be categorized into semantic metadata ,geometric metadata , and image processing metadata .\nFor this, we use functionalities from Pillow [3] OpenCV [1], and Omnidata [26].\nThe following semantic metadata are extracted from bounding boxes, poses, and segmentation maps:\n\u2022Crowdedness score : number of humans (extracted from 4DHumans instances)\n\u2022SAM clutter score : number of SAM instances\n\u2022COCO clutter score : number of COCO [55] instances\n\u2022COCO instance diversity : number of unique COCO instance classes\n\u2022Objectness score : % of pixels that belong to countable COCO semantic classes\n\u2022Walkability score : % of pixels belonging to walkable COCO semantic classes such as \u2018road\u2019\n\u2022Semantic diversity : number of unique COCO semantic classes\n\u2022Caption length : length of the caption in characters, words, and sentences\nThese are aimed to capture the semantic regularities of the scene at a more holistic level as opposed\nto pixel-based representations.\nSimilarly, geometric metadata captures the scene geometry more globally. They are extracted from\nsurface normals and depth maps:\n\u2022Geometric complexity : angular variance of surface normals\n\u2022Occlusion score : % of occlusion edges over a fixed threshold\nFinally, image processing metadata contains several aspects of images such as original image height\nand width before cropping, which can be used as conditioning to generate higher quality images [ 66],\nbrightness, contrast, saturation, entropy , and colorfulness [37]. Similar to color palette, these help\nwith encoding low-level image representations into the model and enable more steerable generation.\nText: Large language models (LLMs) trained on large text corpora learn strong representations as\nshown by several works [ 23,68,85,64]. We include captions from CC12M [ 15] and COYO700M [ 11]\ndatasets, as well as web text from C4 [ 68] for language modeling. Next, we employ both a standard\nWordPiece [ 23] tokenizer for captions as [ 62] as well as caption embeddings obtained from a\nT5-XXL [ 68] encoder to capture better text representations, which have been shown to improve\ntext-to-image generation fidelity [76, 13] (See fig. 4).\n4\nViT \nencoderVQDiffusion\ndecoderSpatial discrete VAE with diffusion decoder: RGB,normal,depth,edges\nVQ-VAE quantization loss\nReconstruction lossNoised image\nViT decoderSpatial discrete VAE: Segmentation,CLIP,DINOv2,ImageBind,SAMinst.\nMLP\nencoderMLP decoderMLP discrete VAE: Humanposes,DINOv2&ImageBindglobaltokens\n123 WordPiece WordPieceSequence tokenizer: Text,boundingboxes,metadata,colorpalette\n...ABC\nDEF\nG\nIn bamboo thickets, \nA red panda's gentle \ngaze, \nAutumn's calm \nembrace.In bamboo thickets, \nA red panda's gentle \ngaze, \nAutumn's calm \nembrace.\nReconstruction lossVQ-VAE quantization loss\nDiffusion loss123\n456\n789123\n456\n789\nMem-\ncodesViT \nencoderVQFigure 3: Tokenization overview. We employ suitable tokenization schemes for different modalities based on\ntheir format and performance. For image-like modalities and feature maps, we use spatial VQ-V AEs [ 63] with\noptional diffusion decoders for detail rich modalities like RGB. For non-spatial modalities like global tokens or\nparameterized poses, we compress them to a fixed number of discrete tokens using Memcodes [ 60] with MLP\nencoders and decoders. All sequence modalities are encoded as text using WordPiece [ 23]. The shown examples\nare real tokenizer reconstructions. Notice the low reconstruction error. See appendix D for more details.\n2.2 Tokenization\nTokenization consists of converting modalities and tasks into sequences or sets of discrete tokens ,\nthereby unifying their representation space. This is critical for training large multimodal models as\nit confers the following key benefits: 1) It enables training multimodal and multitask models with\na single pre-training objective. After tokenization, all tasks are formulated as a per-token classifi-\ncation problem using the cross-entropy loss. This improves training stability, enables full parameter\nsharing, and removes the need for task-specific heads, loss functions, and loss balancing. 2) It makes\ngenerative tasks more tractable by allowing the model to iteratively predict tokens, either autoregres-\nsively [ 69,91] or through progressive unmasking [ 14,13]. 3) It reduces computational complexity by\ncompressing dense modalities like images into a sparse sequence of tokens. This decreases memory\nand compute requirements, which is crucial when scaling up to larger dataset and model sizes.\nWe use different tokenization approaches to discretize modalities with different characteristics. See\nfig. 3 for an overview. To summarize, we mainly use three different types of tokenizers, as explained\nbelow. Please see appendices D and H for more details and insights on tokenizer design choices.\nViT tokenizer (with optional diffusion decoder): We trained modality-specific ViT [ 24] based\nVQ-V AE [ 63] tokenizers for image-like modalities such as edges and feature maps. The resulting\ntokens form a small grid of size 14\u00d714or16\u00d716, according to the pseudo-labeler patch size. The\nedge tokenizers use a diffusion decoder [78, 62] to get visually more plausible reconstructions.\nMLP tokenizer: For human poses and global embeddings from DINOv2 and ImageBind, we use\nBottleneck MLP [ 6] based discrete V AEs with Memcodes quantization [ 60] to tokenize them into a\nsmall number of tokens, e.g. 16.\nText tokenizer: We leverage a WordPiece [ 23] tokenizer which is used to encode not only text,\nbut also other modalities such as bounding boxes, color palettes and metadata using a shared set of\nspecial tokens to encode their type and values (See appendix D.6 for details).\n2.3 Training details\nDatasets: We perform the training in two stages, namely a 4M pre-training stage on a significantly\nlarger image dataset, followed by a fine-tuning phase on a smaller dataset containing a larger number\nof modalities. Since the 4M-XL model showed signs of overfitting on sequence modalities when\ntrained on CC12M [ 15], we re-trained the models on COYO700M [ 11], containing 50 times more\nsamples. COYO700M was pseudo labeled with the same modalities used for 4M. To cut down\non pseudo labeling cost when expanding the number of modalities, we decided to pseudo label\nCC12M instead of COYO700M, and fine-tune the models with both new and old modalities. To avoid\noverfitting the larger models, we co-train them with samples from COYO700M. In addition to the\npreviously mentioned multimodal datasets, we also included the C4 [ 68] text corpus in training. We\nperform the training by randomly sampling elements of each batch from any of these datasets, given\n5\nFine-grained multimodal conditioning control\nCaption input :\ntwo football \nplayers warming \nup on the pitchCaption input :\na picture of two \nastronauts in a \nlush jungleCaption input :\na painting of two \ngreek philosophers \nwalking on an old \nstreetCaption input :\na painting of two \nclowns walking on \nthe street with \nskyscrapers\nCaption input :\na colorful painting \nof bride and \ngroom walking \ndown the aisleCaption input :\nan oil painting of \ntwo shepherds on \na mountain \nmeadowCaption input :\na sketch of business \npeople walking in the \ncorridor of a modern \noffice buildingCaption input :\na minimalist \nsketch of two stick \nfiguresHuman pose \ninput:\nProbing with grounded generation\nPolygon input RGB generationCaption\ninputRGB generation\nCaption\ninput\na bowl of \nsoup on a \nwooden\ntableSAM edges \ninputa winter \nride with \nfamily\nriding a \nblue car at \nsunset\na historical \nphoto of a \nclassic car\nSteerable multimodal data generation from metadata\nCaption \ninput:\na picture of \na Swiss \nmountain \nsceneMetadata\ninput:Walkability # humans# SAM \ninstancesOcclusion \nscoreOriginal \nresolutionContrast\n10%\n40%\n80%1\n4\n203\n30\n20010%\n25%\n85%64x64\n256x256\n2048x204815%\n60%\n90%\nCaption input :a metallic blue sphere to the left of a yellow box made of felt Caption input :a blue semi-truck and its trailer jumping over a row of motorcycles\nCaption input :a black background with a large yellow circle and a small red square Caption input :a green pepper to the left of a red pepper\n4M-7(from caption) 4M-21(from caption) 4M-21(from T5-XXL emb.)4M-7(from caption) 4M-21(from caption) 4M-21(from T5-XXL emb.)\n4M-7(from caption) 4M-21(from caption) 4M-21(from T5-XXL emb.)4M-7(from caption) 4M-21(from caption) 4M-21(from T5-XXL emb.)Improved text understanding capabilitiesFigure 4: Fine-grained & steerable multimodal generation.

Bottom left: This enables us to perform\nmultimodal edits (e.g. editing the shape of a polygon or grounding generation with edges) and probe the learned\nrepresentation. For example, by only changing the shape of the ellipse, 4M-21 renders the bowl from different\nangles. Top right: By pre-training on 21 types of modalities, including T5-XXL embeddings, and co-training\nwith language modeling on a large text corpus, we show improved text understanding capabilities (even when the\ninput is captions instead of language model embeddings). Bottom right: Compared to generating images from\ncaptions only, metadata provides a more direct and steerable way of controlling the multimodal data generation\nprocess, enabling exciting further research into generative dataset design.\na pre-determined set of sampling weights, and perform language modeling on them. Exact details on\nthe training mixture are given in appendix E.2.\nArchitecture: We adopt 4M\u2019s encoder-decoder based transformer architecture with additional\nmodality embeddings to accommodate new modalities. Similar to 4M, besides RGB tokens, the\nencoder directly accepts RGB pixels with a learnable patch-wise projection to enable use as a ViT [ 24]\nbackbone for transfer learning.\nMasking strategy: We used both multimodal random [ 7,62] and span masking [ 68] strategies that\nmask input and target tokens. We invoke dataset mixing ratios and Dirichlet sampling parameters, \u03b1,\nto ensure stable training on multiple modalities and datasets, as detailed in appendix E.2.\n3 Multimodal capabilities\nWe demonstrate a broad range of capabilities unlocked by 4M-21 , including steerable multimodal\ngeneration (Sec. 3.1), multimodal retrieval (Sec. 3.2) and strong out-of-the-box capabilities (Sec. 3.3).\nPlease see the project website for more visualizations demonstrating these capabilities.\n3.1 Steerable multimodal generation\n4M-21 can predict any training modality by iteratively decoding tokens [ 62,14,13]. This is shown in\nfig. 2 where we can generate all modalities from a given input modality in a consistent manner. Further-\nmore, as we can generate anyof the training modalities from anysubset of other modalities, both con-\nditionally and unconditionally, it enables several ways to perform fine-grained and multimodal gener-\nation, as shown in fig. 4. This includes diverse capabilities such as performing multimodal edits, prob-\ning the learned representations, and steering multimodal data generation. Moreover, 4M-21 exhibits\nimproved text understanding capabilities leading to geometrically and semantically plausible gen-\nerations, both when conditioning on T5-XXL embeddings and on regular captions (fig. 4, top right).\n6\na bird\u2019s eye view\nof sunset shores\nbeach hotelTop-3 Retrievals Query\ndetails of the\nneuschwanstein\ncastleski season is coming\na fancy mansion\nbrightness: 30/255\na fancy mansion\nbrightness: 200/255\na fancy mansion\nbrightness: 200/255\nwalkability: 75%Top-3 Retrievals QueryAny-to-RGB retrieval Any-to-any retrieval Multimodal retrieval\nTop-3 Retrievals Query\nFigure 5: Different modes of multimodal retrieval. We perform multimodal retrievals by predicting global\nembeddings (here shown for DINOv2) from a given input (of any modality) using 4M-21 and comparing the\ncosine distances between the query and retrieval set embeddings. Left: Retrieving RGB images from distinctly\ndifferent query modalities (here RGB, segmentation map, edges, depth map, color palette, and caption). Middle:\nRetrieving any modality using any other modality as the query input. Each query modality constrains the\nretrievals differently, e.g. here the RGB image and caption queries always yield Neuschwanstein castle retrievals.\nIn contrast, for depth and semantic queries, the scene is more ambiguous, thus they retrieve other buildings\nwith similar characteristics. Right: We can also combine any subset of modalities to define the query input, e.g.\nsurface normals and a color palette, to better control the retrieval. See appendix B.2 for more results.\n3.2 Multimodal retrieval\nOur model can also perform multimodal retrievals by predicting global embeddings of DINOv2 and\nImageBind from any (subset) of the input modalities . Once the global embeddings are obtained,\nthe retrieval is done by finding the retrieval set samples with the smallest cosine distance to the\nquery [ 65,33]. As shown in fig. 5, this unlocks retrieval capabilities that were not possible with the\noriginal DINOv2 and ImageBind models such as retrieving RGB images or any other modality via\nusing any other modality as the query. Furthermore, one can combine multiple modalities to predict\nthe global embedding, resulting in better control over retrievals, as shown on the right.\nPseudo Label Predictions Pseudo Label Predictions Pseudo Label PredictionsRGB Input Predictions\nCaptionBounding\nboxesSemantic\nsegmentationDepth CLIPSurface\nnormalsHuman\nposesDINOv2ImageBind MetadataCanny\nedgesSAM\nedgesSAM\ninstancesColor\npalette\nFigure 6: Out-of-the-box vision tasks.

The model learned to solve all the tasks\nwithout a loss of performance, is significantly better than the baselines, and is competitive with pseudo labelers,\nwhile being a single model for all tasks .

In table 1, we evaluate the performance on DIODE [ 86] surface normal and depth\nestimation, COCO [ 55] semantic and instance segmentation, 3DPW [ 87] 3D human pose estimation,\nand do ImageNet-1K [ 75] kNN retrieval using predicted DINOv2 global tokens. We compare against\nthe pseudo labeling networks, strong baselines, and the 4Mmodel from [ 62] trained on 7 modalities.\nFor surface normal estimation and semantic segmentation, we observed that ensembling multiple\npredictions significantly improves performance, see appendix F for more details and results.\nOur model consistently achieves strong out-of-the-box performance, and often matches or even\noutperforms the pseudo labelers and other specialist baselines, while being a single model for all\ntasks . Notice the large performance gap with other multitask models like Unified-IO [ 59] and\nUnified-IO-2 [ 58]. For kNN retrieval, 4M-21 XL performance approaches the tokenizer bound, i.e.\nthe retrieval performance using the DINOv2 tokenizer reconstructions. While the smaller models lag\nbehind 4Mmodels, we observe that 4M-21 XL is able to match the performance of 4M-7 XL , while\nbeing trained to solve three times more tasks. The trend over the model size needing to be larger is\nexpected as the number of tasks increase.\n4 Transfer experiments\nTo study the scaling characteristics of pre-training any-to-any models on a larger set of modalities, we\ntrain models across three different sizes: B,L, and XL. We then transfer their encoders to downstream\ntasks and evaluate on both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB + Depth) settings. The decoders\nare discarded for all transfer experiments, and we instead train task-specific heads. We perform\nself-comparisons in a similar manner to [62, 7], as well as comparing to a set of strong baselines.\nUnimodal transfers. For unimodal transfers we leverage the RGB patch embeddings learned during\nthe pre-training, as RGB pixel inputs are used alongside the tokenized modalities. For the XL models\nand DINOv2 g, we perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA [ 40] instead of full fine-\n8\nTable 2: Unimodal transfer study. We transfer 4M-21 and baselines to ImageNet-1K [ 75] classification,\nADE20K [ 100] semantic segmentation, NYUv2 [ 80] depth estimation, and ARKitScenes [ 9] (ARKS) 3D object\ndetection. We observe that 4M-21 1)does not lose performance for the transfer tasks that are similar to the\nseven modalities of 4M, i.e. first three columns of the results, while being able to solve many more, and 2)\nleads to improved performance for novel tasks that are more different from 4M modalities, e.g. 3D object\ndetection (last column). The improvements are further verified in the multimodal transfer results (Table 3)\nshowing the usefulness of new modalities.

We did not observe similar performance\ngains for the smaller models. Further training details are described in appendix G.\nWe evaluate on ImageNet-1K classification [ 22,75], ADE20K semantic segmentation [ 100], NYUv2\ndepth estimation [ 80], and ARKitScenes [ 9] 3D object detection tasks. Some transfer tasks are\ncompletely unseen during pre-training, e.g. object classification or 3D object detection, while others\nare included as different instantiations, e.g. absolute depth instead of relative depth, or using ADE20K\ninstead of COCO classes. We follow the best practices and commonly used settings from other\npapers [62].\nThe results are shown in table 2. We make the following observations: 1)for the transfer tasks that\nare similar to the seven modalities of 4M, e.g. semantic segmentation or depth, 4M-21 does not lose\nperformance due to being trained on many more modalities, 2)for novel transfer tasks like 3D object\ndetection that are sufficiently different from 4M modalities, we observe an improved performance.\nMoreover, the performance improves with larger model sizes, showing promising scaling trends.\nThese trends can be further seen in the multimodal transfer results, which we explain next.\nTable 3: Multimodal transfer study. We trans-\nfer both 4M-21 and 4M (pre-trained on CC12M)\nto NYUv2 and Hypersim segmentation, and 3D\nobject detection on ARKitScenes.

Earlier methods [ 27,61,48]\ncombined multiple dense vision tasks into a single\nmodel but faced challenges scaling to a larger variety\n9\nof tasks and modalities, limited by training instabilities and the need for careful task selection and\nloss balancing to reduce negative transfer [46, 96, 82, 94].\nRecently, discrete tokenization has enabled a shift towards integrating numerous vision tasks\ninto unified multimodal and multitask models such as Gato [ 71], OFA [ 88], Pix2Seq [ 16,17],\nUnifiedIO [ 59,58], 4M [ 62], and more [ 49,79,5,39,25,42,4,92,83,102,52,99]. These\nmethods first transform various modalities and tasks into sequences or sets of discrete to-\nkens [ 23,50,63,29,90], and then train a single Transformer on these tokens using either a sequence\nmodeling [ 71,88,59,16,17,49,79] or masked modeling objective [ 62,89]. Some methods (e.g.\nGato [ 71], UnifiedIO [ 59,58]) perform co-training on multiple disjoint datasets and are capable of\nperforming a wide range of tasks, but not jointly. In contrast, methods like 4M [ 62] train on a single\naligned dataset through the use of pseudo labeling, enabling any-to-any modality prediction but on a\ntypically more limited set of modalities. We significantly expand upon them by adding the ability to\nuse this framework for an even greater amount of modalities and capabilities.\nFurthermore, masked modeling has proven effective for learning useful representations in both\nNLP [ 23,68] and vision [ 38,8,101,28]. Extending it to multimodal domains [ 7,34,89,62] enables\nstrong cross-modal representations which is critical for multimodal learning. When combined with\ntokenization, masked modeling also enables generative applications [ 14,53,13,81,62]. Our work\nhighlights the ability of masked modeling to expand to a much greater set of modalities than previously\nshown, improving upon the out-of-the-box and multimodal generation capabilities of previous works.\n6 Limitations and Discussion\nWe developed an any-to-any model on tens of diverse modalities and tasks. This was achieved\nby mapping all modalities to discrete sets of tokens via modality-specific tokenizers and using\na multimodal masked training objective [ 62]. We successfully scaled the training to 3 billion\nparameters and to 21 modalities and different datasets, without a degradation in performance\ncompared to the existing expert single/few task models. This results in strong out-of-the-box\ncapabilities as well new potential for multimodal interaction, generation, and retrieval, all by a single\nunified model. Below, we discuss limitations and future work.\nTransfer/emergent capabilities: One hope from training a single network on several tasks is leading\nto a model that can solve novel tasks, often referred to as \u201ctransfer\u201d or \u201cemergent\u201d capabilities. While,\nas we showed, a multitask model brings several key advantages even without transfer/emergence\n(e.g., efficiency, using a single model for broad out-of-the-box capabilities, modality fusion, etc.), we\nobserve that the potential for transfer/emergence remains largely untapped . In general, compared\nto LLMs, vision/multimodal models have not shown exciting results in terms of transfer/emergence\nyet. We find this to be an important point to address in the future, e.g., via designing multitask\narchitectures that have emergence, in contrast to out-of-the-box capabilities, as their main objective.\nBetter tokenization: Like any token-based model, ours can directly benefit from progress on tokeniz-\ners, e.g. higher reconstruction fidelity.\nCo-training on partially aligned datasets: We showed the possibility of training on partially aligned\ndatasets, e.g. text data from C4 and other modalities from CC12M, yet further investigations and\na larger mixture of datasets are expected to bring stronger capabilities.\nReferences\n[1] OpenCV. https://opencv.org/ 4\n[2] PyPalette. https://github.com/adamgrieger/pypalette 3, 24\n[3] Python Pillow. https://python-pillow.org/ 4\n[4]Aghajanyan, A., Huang, B., Ross, C., Karpukhin, V ., Xu, H., Goyal, N., Okhonko, D., Joshi, M., Ghosh,\nG., Lewis, M., Zettlemoyer, L.: CM3: A causal masked multimodal model of the internet.

We can see that performing co-\ntraining on C4 [ 68] and COYO700M [ 11] has the potential to slightly improve transfer performance\non average.\nTable 4: Pre-training data and modality mixture ablation: We ablate different pre-training\nmodality and dataset choices on B models. * represents the models initialized from the corresponding\n4M models trained on COYO700M.\nMethodPre-training ImageNet-1K ADE20K NYUv2 depth ARKitScenes\ndata Top-1 acc. \u2191 mIoU\u2191 \u03b41acc.\u2191 AP3D\u2191\n4M-7 B [62] CC12M 84.5 50.1 92.0 40.3\n4M-7 B COYO700M 84.4 49.4 91.4 38.6\n4M-7 B * CC12M 84.5 49.2 91.0 39.5\n4M-21 B * CC12M 84.4 49.2 90.9 40.0\n4M-21 B * CC12M+C4 84.6 49.5 90.4 41.2\n4M-21 B * CC12M+COYO700M+C4 84.5 50.1 90.8 42.4\nC.2 Ablation of ensembling the predictions\nUnlike the deterministic pseudo labeler and other state of the art networks we compared against\nin table 1, our model can produce multiple prediction given the same RGB input through repeated\nsampling with a different seed. As shown in Table 5, ensembling ten samples of predicted surface\nnormals and semantic segmentation maps can significantly improve the reported metrics. While\nensembling improves upon these metrics, we note that the ensembled predictions can be comparatively\nblurrier around object edges than any individual sample.\n22\nTable 5: Ensembling ablation: We ablate ensembling multiple predictions on DIODE normals and\nCOCO semantic segmentation compared to no ensembling.

The pseudo labeling of existing modalities is done in the\nsame fashion as 4M, using Omnidata DPT-Hybrid [ 70] for surface normals and depth estimation,\nCOCO Mask2Former [ 19] with a SwinB [ 56] backbone for semantic segmentation, COCO ViTDet\nViT-H model [ 54] initialized from MAE weights [ 38] for bounding boxes, and CLIP-B16 [ 67] with\nViT-B/16 visual backbone backbone for CLIP feature maps.\n3D human poses. We use 4D-Humans [ 35] to extract 3D pose and shape parameterized by an SMPL\nmodel. For the images in CC12M without humans, we set the pose label to a \u201cnone\" token. For the\nimages with humans, we form a sequence by concatenating the bounding box, body pose, camera,\nand shape values in a sequence for each human instance. As data augmentation, we randomly shuffle\nthe order of each component in the sequence.\nSAM instances. Besides semantic segmentation and bounding boxes, SAM [ 47] instance seg-\nmentation also provides some level of semantic information from an image by clustering together\nsemantically similar pixels in it. Unlike semantic segmentation, SAM instances are not restricted\nto a specific set of classes and can segment in more detail. We use the SAM H model and query it\nwith points in a grid format to obtain the instances. We also considered the SAM-HQ [ 45] H model,\nhowever in the grid-point querying format, it yields very similar results to SAM. We found 32 \u00d732\nquery points to be the optimal choice both for pseudo labeling speed and quality.\nDINOv2 and ImageBind global features & feature maps. We extract both dense feature maps and\nglobal embeddings, i.e. cls token embeddings, from DINOv2-B14 [ 65] and ImageBind-H14 [ 33]\npre-trained models. For the latter, we only extracted the image embeddings, incorporating other\nmodality embeddings such as thermal or audio could be interesting future work.\nT5-XXL embeddings. Language model embeddings, such as from T5-XXL [ 68], have been shown\nto improve the generation fidelity and text understanding capabilities of text-to-image generative\nmodels [ 76,13]. Consequently, we use the T5-XXL encoder to extract text embeddings from all\nCC12M captions, without any preprocessing of the text. Unlike other modalities, we do not convert\nthese text embeddings to a sequence of discrete tokens or treat them as targets (similar to the RGB\npixel modality variant). Instead, we only provide them as inputs using a linear projection from the\nT5-XXL embedding dimension ( dT5-XXL = 4096 ) to our model\u2019s embedding dimension.\nImage metadata. From RGB images, we directly extract different types of metadata like the original\nheight and width before cropping [ 66],brightness, contrast, saturation andentropy . We additionally\nextract a notion of colorfulness , following [37].\nSemantic metadata. We compute the crowdedness score as the number of humans in the pseudo la-\nbeled human poses, the SAM clutter score as the number of SAM instances, the COCO clutter score as\nthe number of COCO instances, the COCO instance diversity as the number of unique COCO instance\nclasses, and the semantic diversity as the number of unique COCO semantic classes in an image. For\ncaption length , we count the number of characters, words, and sentences. As objectness score , we\ncount the percentage of pixels in the COCO semantic segmentation map that belong to countable\nclasses (indices 87, 90, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 109, 110,\n23\n111, 112, 113, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 129, 131, 132 ), and for\nthewalkability score we count classes such as \u2018road\u2019 (indices 87, 90, 97, 100, 102, 105,\n106, 122, 123, 125, 126, 132 ).\nGeometric metadata. To compute the occlusion score , we first generate occlusion edges from depth\nimages by applying a Sobel filter, followed by counting the percentage of occlusion edge pixels that\nsurpass a threshold of 0.3. As a notion of geometric complexity , we project surface normal pixels\nonto the unit sphere, and compute their angular variance. Note that images of indoor scenes or caves\nfeaturing large surfaces pointing in all different directions receive a high score in this metric, while\nones with a more localized geometric variance get a somewhat lower score. Exploring other potential\nnotions of geometric complexity can be an interesting future addition.\nColor palette. For every RGB image, we extract between one and seven color palettes using\nPyPalette [ 2]. During training, we randomly sample one of the color palettes to enable users to input\npalettes with different levels of granularity.\nSAM edges and canny edges. Edges are a convenient way of grounding image generation on shapes\ncontained in images [ 98]. To pseudo label edges, we apply the OpenCV canny edge detector on SAM\ninstance maps and RGB, to obtain SAM edges and canny edges respectively.\nD.2 Tokenization of human poses\nWe use a BottleneckMLP [ 6] with 6 blocks and 1024 width to compress pose into 8 tokens. We use\n1024 vocabulary size, and trained using smooth L1 loss for 15 epochs on CC12M training data. We\nalso binned the global orientation, body shape, and bounding boxes into 1000 discrete bins similar\nto [16]. The final sequence is obtained by also adding identifiers, i.e. \u201cbbox\u201d, \u201cpose\u201d, \u201cshape\u201d, before\nthe corresponding sub-sequence.\nD.3 Tokenization of SAM instances\nThe SAM instance tokenizer is a ViT-based VQ-V AE that tokenizes 64 \u00d764 binary masks into 16\ntokens using a vocabulary size of 1024. The tokenizer is trained using the cross-entropy loss for 24\nepochs on CC12M training data, by resizing individual masks into a square aspect ratio image of\n64\u00d764 pixels. To preserve the SAM instances\u2019 original location, width, and height in the image,\ntheir bounding boxes are extracted. The final sequence for each instance is formed by appending the\nidentifier \u201cpolygon\u201d to 4 numbers that specify the bounding box of the instance, along with the 16\ntoken IDs.\nD.4 Tokenization of global feature maps\nSimilar to human poses, we use BottleneckMLP with 6 blocks and 1024 width to compress DINOv2-\nB14 and ImageBind-H14 global embeddings into 16 tokens. We use 8192 vocabulary size, and\ntrained using cosine similarity loss for 15 epochs.\nD.5 Tokenization of dense feature maps\nWe follow [ 62] and tokenize CLIP-B16, DINOv2-B14, and ImageBind-H14 dense feature maps into\n196, 256, and 256 tokens, respectively, using a ViT-based VQV AE with 8192 vocabulary size and\nsmooth L1 loss.\nD.6 Tokenization of sequence modalities\nWe tokenize text, color palette, metadata, and bounding boxes using a WordPiece tok-\nenizer by fitting it on all captions and 4000 \u201cspecial value\u201d tokens, with a joint vocab-\nulary size of 30k. These special tokens are divided into four groups, each with 1000\nvalues, i.e. v0=0, v0=1, ..., v0=999, v1=0, v1=1, ... v1=999, v2=0, v2=1, ...,\nv2=999, v3=0, v3=1, ..., v3=999 . For bounding boxes, we follow 4M [ 62] and represent\nxmin, ymin, xmax, ymax coordinates using v0, v1, v2, v3 tokens respectively. Other modal-\nities are tokenized by binning their values into corresponding bins, e.g. color palette sequence is\nformed as color =c R =r G =g B =b R =r, ... where ctakes a value between 1 and 7 and\n24\nspecifies the number of colors in the palette and r, g, b takes values between 0-255. We chose to\nmodel metadata using interleaved pairs of special tokens, where the first one specifies the type of\nmetadata modality, and the second specifies its value. For example, a crowdedness score of 3 and a\nbrightness of 120 would be specified as the sequence v1=5 v0=3 v1=10 v0=120 . During training\nthe number of metadata entries and their order is randomized. All of this results in a sequence\nprediction formulation, following [62, 16].\nD.7 Tokenization of Canny and SAM edges\nWe use a VQ-V AE with a diffusion decoder, similar to [ 62] to tokenize the edge modalities. We use\nthe same tokenizer as it reconstructs both edges similarly well.\nE Training Details\nPlease see Tab. 6 for an overview of pre-training settings. For more accurate model comparisons, the\narchitecture and overall training objective of our B, L, and XL models are the same as those of 4M\nmodels. However, we do modify and improve various aspects of the training process that allow us to\nsignificantly increase the number of training modalities. These changes concern modality-specific\naccommodations to the masking strategy, the ability to co-train on several datasets, and the use of a\nmore diversified multimodal masking strategy. We describe these modifications below:\nE.1 Modality-specific accommodations\nPositional and modality embeddings. As with 4M, 4M-21 incorporates both learnable modality em-\nbeddings and fixed sine-cosine positional embeddings for each modality. The positional embeddings\nare either 1D or 2D depending on the modality type.\nMetadata grouping and chunk-based masking. To address the sparsity and number of different\ntypes of metadata, the metadata modalities are all grouped together as a single modality during\ntraining. This prevents the over-allocation of tokens to sparse metadata, enabling a more balanced\ndistribution of the token budget across modalities. However, the standard span masking from T5 [ 68]\nand 4M [ 62] performs random uniform masking at the token level, which can lead to pre-training\ninefficiencies [ 51] and make conditioning on specific metadata difficult, as conditioning on just one\nof them would rarely occur during pre-training with this masking strategy. Instead, we propose to\nmask chunks of sequence (similar to PMI-Masking [ 51]), where the span masking is performed per\nchunk of metadata instead of at the token level.\nE.2 Multidataset co-training and diversified multimodal masking strategy\nMulti-dataset support. Unlike 4M which was only trained on a single aligned dataset, we train\n4M-21 on multiple datasets simultaneously. This flexibility allows for the inclusion of datasets with\nvarying numbers of modalities, which enables training on both large-scale datasets with a smaller\nnumber of modalities and smaller datasets with a larger diversity of modalities.\nSampling and masking strategies. Our data sampling process involves selecting a training dataset\nbased on its sampling weight, followed by choosing a masking strategy from the dataset-specific\nmixture of masking strategies. Input and target tokens are then sampled using the selected strategy.\nCo-training datasets. We co-train on several datasets to improve the model\u2019s performance and the\ndata diversity. These include CC12M [ 15], which comprises about 10 million text-image samples fully\npseudo labeled with all 21 modalities, and accounts for 60% of our training samples. Additionally,\nwe include COYO700M [ 11], with approximately 500 million text-image samples pseudo labeled\nwith the 7 modalities of 4M, and accounts for 20% of our training samples. Lastly, the Colossal\nClean Crawled Corpus (C4) [ 68], a large text-only dataset, is used for language model co-training,\nalso making up 20% of our training samples.\nDiverse mixture of masking strategies. As with 4M [ 62], the masking strategy is governed by\nDirichlet distribution with parameter \u03b1. This distribution influences the sampling of tokens from\nmodalities: a lower \u03b1results in samples dominated by one modality, while a higher \u03b1leads a more\nbalanced representation across all modalities. For both CC12M and COYO datasets, we implement\n25\nmultiple masking strategies to cater to specific training needs, and randomly sample from them for\nevery sample in the batch:\n\u2022All-to-all masking: Involves four masking strategies with symmetric input and target \u03b1set\nto 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 respectively.\n\u2022RGB-to-all masking: Consists of only RGB tokens as input, with target \u03b1all set to 0.5.\n\u2022Caption-biased masking: Includes two strategies, heavily skewed towards either unmasked\ncaptions or T5-XXL embeddings as input. These masking strategies are particularly benefi-\ncial for tasks involving text-to-image generation\nTable 6: Pre-training settings.

Furthermore, table 7 compares Unified-IO, Unified-IO 2, and our model\u2019s out-of-the-\nbox capabilities on surface normal estimation, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Thus, we focus on one modality, namely\nSAM instances, and provide a more detailed look into the impact of different tokenization strategies.\nWe study two approaches for SAM instances: path tokenization andmask tokenization .\nPath tokenization : We represent each instance in the image as a list of polygon coordinates. Then we\ntokenize these coordinates using a Bottleneck MLP-based VQ-V AE tokenizer. To achieve a fixed-size\ninput, the polygons are either simplified or extended to have the same number of corner points. We\nfound that fixing the maximum number of corners to 128 results in a minimal change in the overall\npolygon shape, thus we use this value for all the path tokenization ablations.\nMask tokenization : In this scheme, we first convert each instance to a binary masks and resize them\nto a fixed mask size. Then, we tokenize them using a ViT-based VQ-V AE tokenizer, similar to the\nway we tokenize image-like and feature map modalities.\n29\n9  16* 2585.087.590.092.595.097.5100.0IoU \nNumber of T okensPath T okenization Mask T okenization\n512  1024* 204885.087.590.092.595.097.5100.0Vocabulary Size\nL1 MSE  CE* Dice85.087.590.092.595.097.5100.0Loss\n32 \u00d7 32 64 \u00d7 64* 128 \u00d7 12885.087.590.092.595.097.5100.0Mask SizeFigure 14: Ablating tokenization choices: We ablate the impact of different tokenization choices.

See appendix H for details.\nAblations: We investigated L1 and MSE losses for both tokenization schemes, and additionally\ncross-entropy and Dice loss for the mask tokenization. We also investigated the effects of the total\nnumber of tokens, token vocabulary size, and mask size. To compare the performance of the resulting\ntokenizers, we use the IoU between the pseudo-labeled and reconstructed instances as our metric.\nfig. 14 illustrates the results of different ablated configurations. For each configuration, the remaining\nunspecified parameters are by default set to 16 for the number of tokens, 1024 for the vocabulary\nsize,L1for the loss, and 64 \u00d764 for the mask size. The ablations show that using mask tokenization\nwith 16 tokens, 1024 vocabulary size, and 64\u00d764mask size performs well and sets a good balance\nbetween reconstruction quality and total sequence length.\nIn all ablations, the tokenizers are trained for 24 epochs starting with 5 warmup epochs using the\nAdamW [ 57] optimizer with \u03b21, \u03b22= 0.9,0.999and a batch size of 128. For all the experiments\nexcept the Dice loss, a learning rate of 1e-5 is used. Since using this learning rate for the Dice loss\nexperiment resulted in instabilities, we reduced its learning rate to 1e-6. As demonstrated in fig. 15,\nincreasing the number of tokens results in better reconstruction quality both for the mask tokenizer\nand the path tokenizer. Compared to L1 loss, the cross-entropy loss training obtains reconstructions\nwith smoother edges and better coverage.\nInstance\nground truthMask tokenizer Path tokenizer\nL1 loss\n3x3 tokens 4x4 tokens 4x4 tokens 9 tokens 16 tokens 25 tokensCross entropy L1 loss\n5x5 tokens\nFigure 15: Different tokenization schemes for SAM instances.

The 4M-21 L model was trained for 4 days using 128 A100s. The largest 4M-21 XL\nmodel required 11 days using 128 A100s. Fine-tuning and transfer learning experiments for each\nmodel used approximately 20% additional compute compared to its pre-training. Training the various\ntokenizers (RGB, depth, normals, CLIP, DINOv2, ImageBind, semantic segmentation, SAM edges,\nand Canny edge detection, SAM instances, and 3D human poses) required roughly 5 days using 8\nA100s each, totaling approximately 60 A100-days. In total, the primary experiments reported in the\npaper used approximately 120\u2019000 A100-hours, not including additional preliminary experiments\nand ablations. We estimate the total compute for the full research project, including preliminary and\nunreported experiments, to be 150\u2019000 A100-hours.\nI.2 Social impact\nWe are open sourcing our code and models to support researchers with the democratization of the\ntools and to enable transparent inspection and safeguarding. 4M-21 models are trained on publicly\navailable datasets with some curation, e.g. people\u2019s names are redacted in CC12M [ 15]. However,\nthis process is still noisy, hence we advise caution when using the models for generation.\n31"

As\nwe pre-train larger models, full \ufb01ne-tuning, which retrains all model parameters,\nbecomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example \u2013 deploying indepen-\ndent instances of \ufb01ne-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively\nexpensive. We propose Low-RankAdaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-\ntrained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each\nlayer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable pa-\nrameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B \ufb01ne-tuned with Adam,\nLoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the\nGPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than \ufb01ne-\ntuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite hav-\ning fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters,\nno additional inference latency . We also provide an empirical investigation into\nrank-de\ufb01ciency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the ef\ufb01cacy of\nLoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch\nmodels and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa,\nDeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA .\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nxh\n\ud835\udc35=0\n\ud835\udc34=\ud835\udca9(0,\ud835\udf0e2)\n\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5fPretrained \nWeights\n\ud835\udc4a\u2208\u211d\ud835\udc51\u00d7\ud835\udc51\nxf(x)\n\ud835\udc51\nFigure 1: Our reparametriza-\ntion. We only train AandB.Many applications in natural language processing rely on adapt-\ningonelarge-scale, pre-trained language model to multiple down-\nstream applications. Such adaptation is usually done via \ufb01ne-tuning ,\nwhich updates all the parameters of the pre-trained model. The ma-\njor downside of \ufb01ne-tuning is that the new model contains as many\nparameters as in the original model. As larger models are trained\nevery few months, this changes from a mere \u201cinconvenience\u201d for\nGPT-2 (Radford et al., b) or RoBERTa large (Liu et al., 2019) to a\ncritical deployment challenge for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) with\n175 billion trainable parameters.1\nMany sought to mitigate this by adapting only some parameters or\nlearning external modules for new tasks. This way, we only need\nto store and load a small number of task-speci\ufb01c parameters in ad-\ndition to the pre-trained model for each task, greatly boosting the\noperational ef\ufb01ciency when deployed. However, existing techniques\n\u0003Equal contribution.\n0Compared to V1, this draft includes better baselines, experiments on GLUE, and more on adapter latency.\n1While GPT-3 175B achieves non-trivial performance with few-shot learning, \ufb01ne-tuning boosts its perfor-\nmance signi\ufb01cantly as shown in Appendix A.\n1arXiv:2106.09685v2  [cs.CL]  16 Oct 2021\noften introduce inference latency (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01 et al., 2017) by extending model\ndepth or reduce the model\u2019s usable sequence length (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Ham-\nbardzumyan et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2021) (Section 3). More importantly, these method often fail to\nmatch the \ufb01ne-tuning baselines, posing a trade-off between ef\ufb01ciency and model quality.\nWe take inspiration from Li et al. (2018a); Aghajanyan et al. (2020) which show that the learned\nover-parametrized models in fact reside on a low intrinsic dimension. We hypothesize that the\nchange in weights during model adaptation also has a low \u201cintrinsic rank\u201d, leading to our proposed\nLow-RankAdaptation (LoRA) approach. LoRA allows us to train some dense layers in a neural\nnetwork indirectly by optimizing rank decomposition matrices of the dense layers\u2019 change during\nadaptation instead, while keeping the pre-trained weights frozen, as shown in Figure 1. Using GPT-3\n175B as an example, we show that a very low rank (i.e., rin Figure 1 can be one or two) suf\ufb01ces even\nwhen the full rank (i.e., d) is as high as 12,288, making LoRA both storage- and compute-ef\ufb01cient.\nLoRA possesses several key advantages.\n\u2022 A pre-trained model can be shared and used to build many small LoRA modules for dif-\nferent tasks. We can freeze the shared model and ef\ufb01ciently switch tasks by replacing the\nmatricesAandBin Figure 1, reducing the storage requirement and task-switching over-\nhead signi\ufb01cantly.\n\u2022 LoRA makes training more ef\ufb01cient and lowers the hardware barrier to entry by up to 3\ntimes when using adaptive optimizers since we do not need to calculate the gradients or\nmaintain the optimizer states for most parameters. Instead, we only optimize the injected,\nmuch smaller low-rank matrices.\n\u2022 Our simple linear design allows us to merge the trainable matrices with the frozen weights\nwhen deployed, introducing no inference latency compared to a fully \ufb01ne-tuned model, by\nconstruction.\n\u2022 LoRA is orthogonal to many prior methods and can be combined with many of them, such\nas pre\ufb01x-tuning. We provide an example in Appendix E.\nTerminologies and Conventions We make frequent references to the Transformer architecture\nand use the conventional terminologies for its dimensions. We call the input and output di-\nmension size of a Transformer layer dmodel . We useWq,Wk,Wv, andWoto refer to the\nquery/key/value/output projection matrices in the self-attention module. WorW0refers to a pre-\ntrained weight matrix and \u0001Wits accumulated gradient update during adaptation. We use rto\ndenote the rank of a LoRA module. We follow the conventions set out by (Vaswani et al., 2017;\nBrown et al., 2020) and use Adam (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2019; Kingma & Ba, 2017) for model\noptimization and use a Transformer MLP feedforward dimension dffn= 4\u0002dmodel .\n2 P ROBLEM STATEMENT\nWhile our proposal is agnostic to training objective, we focus on language modeling as our motivat-\ning use case. Below is a brief description of the language modeling problem and, in particular, the\nmaximization of conditional probabilities given a task-speci\ufb01c prompt.\nSuppose we are given a pre-trained autoregressive language model P\b(yjx)parametrized by \b.\nFor instance, P\b(yjx)can be a generic multi-task learner such as GPT (Radford et al., b; Brown\net al., 2020) based on the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017). Consider adapting this\npre-trained model to downstream conditional text generation tasks, such as summarization, machine\nreading comprehension (MRC), and natural language to SQL (NL2SQL). Each downstream task is\nrepresented by a training dataset of context-target pairs: Z=f(xi;yi)gi=1;::;N, where both xiand\nyiare sequences of tokens. For example, in NL2SQL, xiis a natural language query and yiits\ncorresponding SQL command; for summarization, xiis the content of an article and yiits summary.\n2\nDuring full \ufb01ne-tuning, the model is initialized to pre-trained weights \b0and updated to \b0+ \u0001\b\nby repeatedly following the gradient to maximize the conditional language modeling objective:\nmax\n\bX\n(x;y)2ZjyjX\nt=1log(P\b(ytjx;y<t)) (1)\nOne of the main drawbacks for full \ufb01ne-tuning is that for each downstream task, we learn a different\nset of parameters \u0001\bwhose dimensionj\u0001\bjequalsj\b0j. Thus, if the pre-trained model is large\n(such as GPT-3 with j\b0j\u0019175Billion), storing and deploying many independent instances of\n\ufb01ne-tuned models can be challenging, if at all feasible.\nIn this paper, we adopt a more parameter-ef\ufb01cient approach, where the task-speci\ufb01c parameter\nincrement \u0001\b = \u0001\b(\u0002) is further encoded by a much smaller-sized set of parameters \u0002with\nj\u0002j\u001cj \b0j. The task of \ufb01nding \u0001\bthus becomes optimizing over \u0002:\nmax\n\u0002X\n(x;y)2ZjyjX\nt=1log\u0000\np\b0+\u0001\b(\u0002) (ytjx;y<t)\u0001\n(2)\nIn the subsequent sections, we propose to use a low-rank representation to encode \u0001\bthat is both\ncompute- and memory-ef\ufb01cient. When the pre-trained model is GPT-3 175B, the number of train-\nable parametersj\u0002jcan be as small as 0:01% ofj\b0j.\n3 A REN\u2019TEXISTING SOLUTIONS GOOD ENOUGH ?\nThe problem we set out to tackle is by no means new. Since the inception of transfer learning, dozens\nof works have sought to make model adaptation more parameter- and compute-ef\ufb01cient. See Sec-\ntion 6 for a survey of some of the well-known works. Using language modeling as an example, there\nare two prominent strategies when it comes to ef\ufb01cient adaptations: adding adapter layers (Houlsby\net al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01 et al., 2017; Pfeiffer et al., 2021; R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020) or optimizing some forms\nof the input layer activations (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al., 2020;\nLiu et al., 2021). However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\ning multi-task settings (R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\nthe extra compute in adapter layers. This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al. (2020); Lep-\nikhin et al. (2020), because the additional depth requires more synchronous GPU operations such as\nAllReduce andBroadcast , unless we store the adapter parameters redundantly many times.\nDirectly Optimizing the Prompt is Hard The other direction, as exempli\ufb01ed by pre\ufb01x tuning (Li\n& Liang, 2021), faces a different challenge. We observe that pre\ufb01x tuning is dif\ufb01cult to optimize\nand that its performance changes non-monotonically in trainable parameters, con\ufb01rming similar\nobservations in the original paper. More fundamentally, reserving a part of the sequence length for\nadaptation necessarily reduces the sequence length available to process a downstream task, which\nwe suspect makes tuning the prompt less performant compared to other methods. We defer the study\non task performance to Section 5.\n3\nBatch Size 32 16 1\nSequence Length 512 256 128\nj\u0002j 0.5M 11M 11M\nFine-Tune/LoRA 1449.4\u00060.8 338.0 \u00060.6 19.8 \u00062.7\nAdapterL1482.0\u00061.0 (+2.2%) 354.8 \u00060.5 (+5.0%) 23.9 \u00062.1 (+20.7%)\nAdapterH1492.2\u00061.0 (+3.0%) 366.3 \u00060.5 (+8.4%) 25.8 \u00062.2 (+30.3%)\nTable 1: Infernece latency of a single forward pass in GPT-2 medium measured in milliseconds, av-\neraged over 100 trials.

AdapterLand AdapterHare two variants of adapter tuning, which we\ndescribe in Section 5.1. The inference latency introduced by adapter layers can be signi\ufb01cant in an\nonline, short-sequence-length scenario. See the full study in Appendix B.\n4 O URMETHOD\nWe describe the simple design of LoRA and its practical bene\ufb01ts. The principles outlined here apply\nto any dense layers in deep learning models, though we only focus on certain weights in Transformer\nlanguage models in our experiments as the motivating use case.\n4.1 L OW-RANK -PARAMETRIZED UPDATE MATRICES\nA neural network contains many dense layers which perform matrix multiplication. The weight\nmatrices in these layers typically have full-rank. When adapting to a speci\ufb01c task, Aghajanyan et al.\n(2020) shows that the pre-trained language models have a low \u201cinstrisic dimension\u201d and can still\nlearn ef\ufb01ciently despite a random projection to a smaller subspace. Inspired by this, we hypothe-\nsize the updates to the weights also have a low \u201cintrinsic rank\u201d during adaptation. For a pre-trained\nweight matrix W02Rd\u0002k, we constrain its update by representing the latter with a low-rank de-\ncomposition W0+ \u0001W=W0+BA, whereB2Rd\u0002r;A2Rr\u0002k, and the rank r\u001cmin(d;k).\nDuring training, W0is frozen and does not receive gradient updates, while AandBcontain trainable\nparameters. Note both W0and\u0001W=BAare multiplied with the same input, and their respective\noutput vectors are summed coordinate-wise. For h=W0x, our modi\ufb01ed forward pass yields:\nh=W0x+ \u0001Wx=W0x+BAx (3)\nWe illustrate our reparametrization in Figure 1. We use a random Gaussian initialization for Aand\nzero forB, so\u0001W=BAis zero at the beginning of training. We then scale \u0001Wx by\u000b\nr, where\u000b\nis a constant in r. When optimizing with Adam, tuning \u000bis roughly the same as tuning the learning\nrate if we scale the initialization appropriately. As a result, we simply set \u000bto the \ufb01rstrwe try\nand do not tune it. This scaling helps to reduce the need to retune hyperparameters when we vary\nr(Yang & Hu, 2021).\nA Generalization of Full Fine-tuning. A more general form of \ufb01ne-tuning allows the training of\na subset of the pre-trained parameters. LoRA takes a step further and does not require the accumu-\nlated gradient update to weight matrices to have full-rank during adaptation. This means that when\napplying LoRA to all weight matrices and training all biases2, we roughly recover the expressive-\nness of full \ufb01ne-tuning by setting the LoRA rank rto the rank of the pre-trained weight matrices. In\nother words, as we increase the number of trainable parameters3, training LoRA roughly converges\nto training the original model, while adapter-based methods converges to an MLP and pre\ufb01x-based\nmethods to a model that cannot take long input sequences.\nNo Additional Inference Latency. When deployed in production, we can explicitly compute and\nstoreW=W0+BA and perform inference as usual. Note that both W0andBA are inRd\u0002k.\nWhen we need to switch to another downstream task, we can recover W0by subtracting BAand\nthen adding a different B0A0, a quick operation with very little memory overhead. Critically, this\n2They represent a negligible number of parameters compared to weights.\n3An inevitability when adapting to hard tasks.\n4\nguarantees that we do not introduce any additional latency during inference compared to a \ufb01ne-tuned\nmodel by construction.\n4.2 A PPLYING LORA TOTRANSFORMER\nIn principle, we can apply LoRA to any subset of weight matrices in a neural network to reduce the\nnumber of trainable parameters. In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\nthe self-attention module ( Wq;Wk;Wv;Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq(orWk,Wv)\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel\u0002dmodel , even though the output dimension is usually sliced\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\nand parameter-ef\ufb01ciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1. We leave the empirical investigation of adapting the MLP\nlayers, LayerNorm layers, and biases to a future work.\nPractical Bene\ufb01ts and Limitations. The most signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t comes from the reduction in\nmemory and storage usage. For a large Transformer trained with Adam, we reduce that VRAM\nusage by up to 2=3ifr\u001cdmodel as we do not need to store the optimizer states for the frozen\nparameters. On GPT-3 175B, we reduce the VRAM consumption during training from 1.2TB to\n350GB. With r= 4and only the query and value projection matrices being adapted, the checkpoint\nsize is reduced by roughly 10,000 \u0002(from 350GB to 35MB)4. This allows us to train with signi\ufb01-\ncantly fewer GPUs and avoid I/O bottlenecks. Another bene\ufb01t is that we can switch between tasks\nwhile deployed at a much lower cost by only swapping the LoRA weights as opposed to all the\nparameters. This allows for the creation of many customized models that can be swapped in and out\non the \ufb02y on machines that store the pre-trained weights in VRAM. We also observe a 25% speedup\nduring training on GPT-3 175B compared to full \ufb01ne-tuning5as we do not need to calculate the\ngradient for the vast majority of the parameters.\nLoRA also has its limitations. For example, it is not straightforward to batch inputs to different tasks\nwith different AandBin a single forward pass, if one chooses to absorb AandBintoWto eliminate\nadditional inference latency. Though it is possible to not merge the weights and dynamically choose\nthe LoRA modules to use for samples in a batch for scenarios where latency is not critical.\n5 E MPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\nWe evaluate the downstream task performance of LoRA on RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), De-\nBERTa (He et al., 2021), and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b), before scaling up to GPT-3 175B (Brown\net al., 2020). Our experiments cover a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding\n(NLU) to generation (NLG). Speci\ufb01cally, we evaluate on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) benchmark\nfor RoBERTa and DeBERTa. We follow the setup of Li & Liang (2021) on GPT-2 for a direct com-\nparison and add WikiSQL (Zhong et al., 2017) (NL to SQL queries) and SAMSum (Gliwa et al.,\n2019) (conversation summarization) for large-scale experiments on GPT-3. See Appendix C for\nmore details on the datasets we use. We use NVIDIA Tesla V100 for all experiments.\n5.1 B ASELINES\nTo compare with other baselines broadly, we replicate the setups used by prior work and reuse their\nreported numbers whenever possible. This, however, means that some baselines might only appear\nin certain experiments.\nFine-Tuning (FT) is a common approach for adaptation. During \ufb01ne-tuning, the model is initialized\nto the pre-trained weights and biases, and all model parameters undergo gradient updates.A simple\nvariant is to update only some layers while freezing others. We include one such baseline reported\nin prior work (Li & Liang, 2021) on GPT-2, which adapts just the last two layers ( FTTop2).\n4We still need the 350GB model during deployment; however, storing 100 adapted models only requires\n350GB + 35MB * 100 \u0019354GB as opposed to 100 * 350GB \u001935TB.\n5For GPT-3 175B, the training throughput for full \ufb01ne-tuning is 32.5 tokens/s per V100 GPU; with the same\nnumber of weight shards for model parallelism, the throughput is 43.1 tokens/s per V100 GPU for LoRA.\n5\nModel & Method # Trainable\nParameters MNLI SST-2 MRPC CoLA QNLI QQP RTE STS-B Avg.\nRoB base(FT)* 125.0M 87.6 94.8 90.2 63.6 92.8 91.9 78.7 91.2 86.4\nRoB base(BitFit)* 0.1M 84.7 93.7 92.7 62.0 91.8 84.0 81.5 90.8 85.2\nRoB base(AdptD)* 0.3M 87.1\u0006.094.2\u0006.188.5\u00061.160.8\u0006.493.1\u0006.190.2\u0006.071.5\u00062.789.7\u0006.384.4\nRoB base(AdptD)* 0.9M 87.3\u0006.194.7\u0006.388.4\u0006.162.6\u0006.993.0\u0006.290.6\u0006.075.9\u00062.290.3\u0006.185.4\nRoB base(LoRA) 0.3M 87.5\u0006.395.1\u0006.289.7\u0006.763.4\u00061.293.3\u0006.390.8\u0006.186.6\u0006.791.5\u0006.287.2\nRoB large(FT)* 355.0M 90.2 96.4 90.9 68.0 94.7 92.2 86.6 92.4 88.9\nRoB large(LoRA) 0.8M 90.6\u0006.296.2\u0006.590.9\u00061.268.2\u00061.994.9\u0006.391.6\u0006.187.4\u00062.592.6\u0006.289.0\nRoB large(AdptP)y 3.0M 90.2\u0006.396.1\u0006.390.2\u0006.768.3\u00061.094.8\u0006.291.9\u0006.183.8\u00062.992.1\u0006.788.4\nRoB large(AdptP)y 0.8M 90.5\u0006.396.6\u0006.289.7\u00061.267.8\u00062.594.8\u0006.391.7\u0006.280.1\u00062.991.9\u0006.487.9\nRoB large(AdptH)y 6.0M 89.9\u0006.596.2\u0006.388.7\u00062.966.5\u00064.494.7\u0006.292.1\u0006.183.4\u00061.191.0\u00061.787.8\nRoB large(AdptH)y 0.8M 90.3\u0006.396.3\u0006.587.7\u00061.766.3\u00062.094.7\u0006.291.5\u0006.172.9\u00062.991.5\u0006.586.4\nRoB large(LoRA)y 0.8M 90.6\u0006.296.2\u0006.590.2\u00061.068.2\u00061.994.8\u0006.391.6\u0006.285.2\u00061.192.3\u0006.588.6\nDeB XXL(FT)* 1500.0M 91.8 97.2 92.0 72.0 96.0 92.7 93.9 92.9 91.1\nDeB XXL(LoRA) 4.7M 91.9\u0006.296.9\u0006.292.6\u0006.672.4\u00061.196.0\u0006.192.9\u0006.194.9\u0006.493.0\u0006.291.3\nTable 2: RoBERTa base, RoBERTa large, and DeBERTa XXLwith different adaptation methods on the\nGLUE benchmark.

(2019) for a fair comparison.\nBias-only or BitFit is a baseline where we only train the bias vectors while freezing everything else.\nContemporarily, this baseline has also been studied by BitFit (Zaken et al., 2021).\nPre\ufb01x-embedding tuning (PreEmbed) inserts special tokens among the input tokens. These spe-\ncial tokens have trainable word embeddings and are generally not in the model\u2019s vocabulary. Where\nto place such tokens can have an impact on performance. We focus on \u201cpre\ufb01xing\u201d, which prepends\nsuch tokens to the prompt, and \u201cin\ufb01xing\u201d, which appends to the prompt; both are discussed in Li &\nLiang (2021). We use lp(resp.li) denote the number of pre\ufb01x (resp. in\ufb01x) tokens. The number of\ntrainable parameters is j\u0002j=dmodel\u0002(lp+li).\nPre\ufb01x-layer tuning (PreLayer) is an extension to pre\ufb01x-embedding tuning. Instead of just learning\nthe word embeddings (or equivalently, the activations after the embedding layer) for some special\ntokens, we learn the activations after every Transformer layer. The activations computed from pre-\nvious layers are simply replaced by trainable ones. The resulting number of trainable parameters is\nj\u0002j=L\u0002dmodel\u0002(lp+li), whereLis the number of Transformer layers.\nAdapter tuning as proposed in Houlsby et al. (2019) inserts adapter layers between the self-\nattention module (and the MLP module) and the subsequent residual connection. There are two\nfully connected layers with biases in an adapter layer with a nonlinearity in between. We call this\noriginal design AdapterH. Recently, Lin et al. (2020) proposed a more ef\ufb01cient design with the\nadapter layer applied only after the MLP module and after a LayerNorm. We call it AdapterL. This\nis very similar to another deign proposed in Pfeiffer et al. (2021), which we call AdapterP. We also\ninclude another baseline call AdapterDrop (R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020) which drops some adapter layers for\ngreater ef\ufb01ciency ( AdapterD). We cite numbers from prior works whenever possible to maximize\nthe number of baselines we compare with; they are in rows with an asterisk (*) in the \ufb01rst column.\nIn all cases, we have j\u0002j=^LAdpt\u0002(2\u0002dmodel\u0002r+r+dmodel )+2\u0002^LLN\u0002dmodel where ^LAdpt\nis the number of adapter layers and ^LLNthe number of trainable LayerNorms (e.g., in AdapterL).\nLoRA adds trainable pairs of rank decomposition matrices in parallel to existing weight matrices.\nAs mentioned in Section 4.2, we only apply LoRA to WqandWvin most experiments for simplicity.\nThe number of trainable parameters is determined by the rank rand the shape of the original weights:\nj\u0002j= 2\u0002^LLoRA\u0002dmodel\u0002r, where ^LLoRA is the number of weight matrices we apply LoRA to.\n6\nModel & Method # Trainable E2E NLG Challenge\nParameters BLEU NIST MET ROUGE-L CIDEr\nGPT-2 M (FT)* 354.92M 68.2 8.62 46.2 71.0 2.47\nGPT-2 M (AdapterL)* 0.37M 66.3 8.41 45.0 69.8 2.40\nGPT-2 M (AdapterL)* 11.09M 68.9 8.71 46.1 71.3 2.47\nGPT-2 M (AdapterH) 11.09M 67.3\u0006.68.50\u0006.07 46.0\u0006.2 70.7\u0006.2 2.44\u0006.01\nGPT-2 M (FTTop2)* 25.19M 68.1 8.59 46.0 70.8 2.41\nGPT-2 M (PreLayer)* 0.35M 69.7 8.81 46.1 71.4 2.49\nGPT-2 M (LoRA) 0.35M 70.4\u0006.18.85\u0006.02 46.8\u0006.2 71.8\u0006.1 2.53\u0006.02\nGPT-2 L (FT)* 774.03M 68.5 8.78 46.0 69.9 2.45\nGPT-2 L (AdapterL) 0.88M 69.1\u0006.18.68\u0006.03 46.3\u0006.0 71.4\u0006.2 2.49\u0006.0\nGPT-2 L (AdapterL) 23.00M 68.9\u0006.38.70\u0006.04 46.1\u0006.1 71.3\u0006.2 2.45\u0006.02\nGPT-2 L (PreLayer)* 0.77M 70.3 8.85 46.2 71.7 2.47\nGPT-2 L (LoRA) 0.77M 70.4\u0006.18.89\u0006.02 46.8\u0006.2 72.0\u0006.2 2.47\u0006.02\nTable 3: GPT-2 medium (M) and large (L) with different adaptation methods on the E2E NLG\nChallenge.

While RoBERTa has been overtaken by much larger models on NLP leaderboards\nsuch as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019) in recent years, it remains a competitive and\npopular pre-trained model for its size among practitioners. We take the pre-trained RoBERTa base\n(125M) and RoBERTa large (355M) from the HuggingFace Transformers library (Wolf et al., 2020)\nand evaluate the performance of different ef\ufb01cient adaptation approaches on tasks from the GLUE\nbenchmark. We also replicate Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021) according to their\nsetup. To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when\ncomparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length\nof 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for\nMRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the \ufb01ne-tuning baseline. Runs\nfollowing this more restricted setup from Houlsby et al. (2019) are labeled with y. The result is\npresented in Table 2 (Top Three Sections). See Section D.1 for details on the hyperparameters used.\n5.3 D EBERT AXXL\nDeBERTa (He et al., 2021) is a more recent variant of BERT that is trained on a much larger\nscale and performs very competitively on benchmarks such as GLUE (Wang et al., 2019) and Su-\nperGLUE (Wang et al., 2020). We evaluate if LoRA can still match the performance of a fully\n\ufb01ne-tuned DeBERTa XXL (1.5B) on GLUE. The result is presented in Table 2 (Bottom Section).\nSee Section D.2 for details on the hyperparameters used.\n5.4 GPT-2 MEDIUM /LARGE\nHaving shown that LoRA can be a competitive alternative to full \ufb01ne-tuning on NLU, we hope to\nanswer if LoRA still prevails on NLG models, such as GPT-2 medium and large (Radford et al.,\nb). We keep our setup as close as possible to Li & Liang (2021) for a direct comparison. Due\nto space constraint, we only present our result on E2E NLG Challenge (Table 3) in this section.\nSee Section F.1 for results on WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017) and DART (Nan et al., 2020).

Due to the high\ntraining cost, we only report the typical standard deviation for a given task over random seeds, as\nopposed to providing one for every entry. See Section D.4 for details on the hyperparameters used.\nAs shown in Table 4, LoRA matches or exceeds the \ufb01ne-tuning baseline on all three datasets. Note\nthat not all methods bene\ufb01t monotonically from having more trainable parameters, as shown in Fig-\nure 2. We observe a signi\ufb01cant performance drop when we use more than 256 special tokens for\npre\ufb01x-embedding tuning or more than 32 special tokens for pre\ufb01x-layer tuning. This corroborates\nsimilar observations in Li & Liang (2021). While a thorough investigation into this phenomenon\nis out-of-scope for this work, we suspect that having more special tokens causes the input distri-\nbution to shift further away from the pre-training data distribution. Separately, we investigate the\nperformance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime in Section F.3.\n6 7 8 9 10 11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters0.550.600.650.700.75Validation Accuracy\nWikiSQL\nMethod\nFine-Tune\nPrefixEmbed\nPrefixLayer\nAdapter(H)\nLoRA\n6 7 8 9 10 11\nlog10 # Trainable Parameters0.840.860.880.900.92\nMultiNLI-matched\nFigure 2: GPT-3 175B validation accuracy vs. number of trainable parameters of several adaptation\nmethods on WikiSQL and MNLI-matched.

Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) is a sequence-to-sequence\narchitecture that makes heavy use of self-attention. Radford et al. (a) applied it to autoregressive lan-\nguage modeling by using a stack of Transformer decoders. Since then, Transformer-based language\nmodels have dominated NLP, achieving the state-of-the-art in many tasks. A new paradigm emerged\nwith BERT (Devlin et al., 2019b) and GPT-2 (Radford et al., b) \u2013 both are large Transformer lan-\n8\nguage models trained on a large amount of text \u2013 where \ufb01ne-tuning on task-speci\ufb01c data after pre-\ntraining on general domain data provides a signi\ufb01cant performance gain compared to training on\ntask-speci\ufb01c data directly. Training larger Transformers generally results in better performance and\nremains an active research direction. GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the largest single Transformer\nlanguage model trained to-date with 175B parameters.\nPrompt Engineering and Fine-Tuning. While GPT-3 175B can adapt its behavior with just a\nfew additional training examples, the result depends heavily on the input prompt (Brown et al.,\n2020). This necessitates an empirical art of composing and formatting the prompt to maximize a\nmodel\u2019s performance on a desired task, which is known as prompt engineering or prompt hacking.\nFine-tuning retrains a model pre-trained on general domains to a speci\ufb01c task Devlin et al. (2019b);\nRadford et al. (a). Variants of it include learning just a subset of the parameters Devlin et al. (2019b);\nCollobert & Weston (2008), yet practitioners often retrain all of them to maximize the downstream\nperformance. However, the enormity of GPT-3 175B makes it challenging to perform \ufb01ne-tuning in\nthe usual way due to the large checkpoint it produces and the high hardware barrier to entry since it\nhas the same memory footprint as pre-training.\nParameter-Ef\ufb01cient Adaptation. Many have proposed inserting adapter layers between existing\nlayers in a neural network (Houlsby et al., 2019; Rebuf\ufb01 et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2020). Our method\nuses a similar bottleneck structure to impose a low-rank constraint on the weight updates. The\nkey functional difference is that our learned weights can be merged with the main weights during\ninference, thus not introducing any latency, which is not the case for the adapter layers (Section 3).\nA comtenporary extension of adapter is COMPACTER (Mahabadi et al., 2021), which essentially\nparametrizes the adapter layers using Kronecker products with some predetermined weight sharing\nscheme. Similarly, combining LoRA with other tensor product-based methods could potentially\nimprove its parameter ef\ufb01ciency, which we leave to future work. More recently, many proposed\noptimizing the input word embeddings in lieu of \ufb01ne-tuning, akin to a continuous and differentiable\ngeneralization of prompt engineering (Li & Liang, 2021; Lester et al., 2021; Hambardzumyan et al.,\n2020; Liu et al., 2021). We include comparisons with Li & Liang (2021) in our experiment section.\nHowever, this line of works can only scale up by using more special tokens in the prompt, which\ntake up available sequence length for task tokens when positional embeddings are learned.\nLow-Rank Structures in Deep Learning. Low-rank structure is very common in machine learn-\ning. A lot of machine learning problems have certain intrinsic low-rank structure (Li et al., 2016;\nCai et al., 2010; Li et al., 2018b; Grasedyck et al., 2013). Moreover, it is known that for many\ndeep learning tasks, especially those with a heavily over-parametrized neural network, the learned\nneural network will enjoy low-rank properties after training (Oymak et al., 2019). Some prior works\neven explicitly impose the low-rank constraint when training the original neural network (Sainath\net al., 2013; Povey et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2014; Jaderberg et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016; Kho-\ndak et al., 2021; Denil et al., 2014); however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these works\nconsiders low-rank update to a frozen model for adaptation to downstream tasks . In theory liter-\nature, it is known that neural networks outperform other classical learning methods, including the\ncorresponding (\ufb01nite-width) neural tangent kernels (Allen-Zhu et al., 2019; Li & Liang, 2018) when\nthe underlying concept class has certain low-rank structure (Ghorbani et al., 2020; Allen-Zhu & Li,\n2019; Allen-Zhu & Li, 2020a). Another theoretical result in Allen-Zhu & Li (2020b) suggests that\nlow-rank adaptations can be useful for adversarial training. In sum, we believe that our proposed\nlow-rank adaptation update is well-motivated by the literature.\n7 U NDERSTANDING THE LOW-RANK UPDATES\nGiven the empirical advantage of LoRA, we hope to further explain the properties of the low-rank\nadaptation learned from downstream tasks. Note that the low-rank structure not only lowers the\nhardware barrier to entry which allows us to run multiple experiments in parallel, but also gives\nbetter interpretability of how the update weights are correlated with the pre-trained weights. We\nfocus our study on GPT-3 175B, where we achieved the largest reduction of trainable parameters\n(up to 10,000\u0002) without adversely affecting task performances.\nWe perform a sequence of empirical studies to answer the following questions: 1) Given a parameter\nbudget constraint, which subset of weight matrices in a pre-trained Transformer should we adapt\n9\nto maximize downstream performance? 2) Is the \u201coptimal\u201d adaptation matrix \u0001Wreally rank-\nde\ufb01cient ? If so, what is a good rank to use in practice? 3) What is the connection between \u0001Wand\nW? Does \u0001Whighly correlate with W? How large is \u0001Wcomparing to W?\nWe believe that our answers to question (2) and (3) shed light on the fundamental principles of using\npre-trained language models for downstream tasks, which is a critical topic in NLP.\n7.1 W HICH WEIGHT MATRICES IN TRANSFORMER SHOULD WEAPPLY LORA TO?\nGiven a limited parameter budget, which types of weights should we adapt with LoRA to obtain\nthe best performance on downstream tasks? As mentioned in Section 4.2, we only consider weight\nmatrices in the self-attention module. We set a parameter budget of 18M (roughly 35MB if stored\nin FP16) on GPT-3 175B, which corresponds to r= 8if we adapt one type of attention weights or\nr= 4if we adapt two types, for all 96 layers. The result is presented in Table 5.\n# of Trainable Parameters = 18M\nWeight Type WqWkWvWoWq;WkWq;WvWq;Wk;Wv;Wo\nRankr 8 8 8 8 4 4 2\nWikiSQL (\u00060:5%) 70.4 70.0 73.0 73.2 71.4 73.7 73.7\nMultiNLI (\u00060:1%) 91.0 90.8 91.0 91.3 91.3 91.3 91.7\nTable 5: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI after applying LoRA to different types of\nattention weights in GPT-3, given the same number of trainable parameters. Adapting both Wqand\nWvgives the best performance overall. We \ufb01nd the standard deviation across random seeds to be\nconsistent for a given dataset, which we report in the \ufb01rst column.\nNote that putting all the parameters in \u0001Wqor\u0001Wkresults in signi\ufb01cantly lower performance,\nwhile adapting both WqandWvyields the best result. This suggests that even a rank of four\ncaptures enough information in \u0001Wsuch that it is preferable to adapt more weight matrices than\nadapting a single type of weights with a larger rank.\n7.2 W HAT IS THE OPTIMAL RANKrFOR LORA?\nWe turn our attention to the effect of rank ron model performance. We adapt fWq;Wvg,\nfWq;Wk;Wv;Wcg, and justWqfor a comparison.\nWeight Type r= 1r= 2r= 4r= 8r= 64\nWikiSQL(\u00060:5%)Wq 68.8 69.6 70.5 70.4 70.0\nWq;Wv 73.4 73.3 73.7 73.8 73.5\nWq;Wk;Wv;Wo 74.1 73.7 74.0 74.0 73.9\nMultiNLI (\u00060:1%)Wq 90.7 90.9 91.1 90.7 90.7\nWq;Wv 91.3 91.4 91.3 91.6 91.4\nWq;Wk;Wv;Wo 91.2 91.7 91.7 91.5 91.4\nTable 6: Validation accuracy on WikiSQL and MultiNLI with different rank r. To our surprise, a\nrank as small as one suf\ufb01ces for adapting both WqandWvon these datasets while training Wqalone\nneeds a larger r. We conduct a similar experiment on GPT-2 in Section H.2.\nTable 6 shows that, surprisingly, LoRA already performs competitively with a very small r(more\nso forfWq;Wvgthan justWq). This suggests the update matrix \u0001Wcould have a very small\n\u201cintrinsic rank\u201d.6To further support this \ufb01nding, we check the overlap of the subspaces learned by\ndifferent choices of rand by different random seeds. We argue that increasing rdoes not cover a\nmore meaningful subspace, which suggests that a low-rank adaptation matrix is suf\ufb01cient.\n6However, we do not expect a small rto work for every task or dataset. Consider the following thought\nexperiment: if the downstream task were in a different language than the one used for pre-training, retraining\nthe entire model (similar to LoRA with r=dmodel ) could certainly outperform LoRA with a small r.\n10\nSubspace similarity between different r.GivenAr=8andAr=64which are the learned adapta-\ntion matrices with rank r= 8and64using the same pre-trained model , we perform singular value\ndecomposition and obtain the right-singular unitary matrices UAr=8andUAr=64.7We hope to an-\nswer: how much of the subspace spanned by the top isingular vectors in UAr=8(for1\u0014i\u00148) is\ncontained in the subspace spanned by top jsingular vectors of UAr=64(for1\u0014j\u001464)? We mea-\nsure this quantity with a normalized subspace similarity based on the Grassmann distance (See Ap-\npendix G for a more formal discussion)\n\u001e(Ar=8;Ar=64;i;j) =jjUi>\nAr=8Uj\nAr=64jj2\nF\nmin(i;j)2[0;1] (4)\nwhereUi\nAr=8represents the columns of UAr=8corresponding to the top- isingular vectors.\n\u001e(\u0001)has a range of [0;1], where 1represents a complete overlap of subspaces and 0a complete\nseparation. See Figure 3 for how \u001echanges as we vary iandj. We only look at the 48th layer\n(out of 96) due to space constraint, but the conclusion holds for other layers as well, as shown\nin Section H.1.\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n1\n6\n12\n18\n23\n29\n35\n40\n46\n52\n58\nj12345678iWq\n1\n6\n12\n18\n23\n29\n35\n40\n46\n52\n58\njWv\n12345678\njWq\n12345678\njWv\n(Ar=64,Ar=8,i,j)\nFigure 3: Subspace similarity between column vectors of Ar=8andAr=64for both \u0001Wqand\u0001Wv.\nThe third and the fourth \ufb01gures zoom in on the lower-left triangle in the \ufb01rst two \ufb01gures. The top\ndirections in r= 8are included in r= 64 , and vice versa.\nWe make an important observation from Figure 3.\nDirections corresponding to the top singular vector overlap signi\ufb01cantly between\nAr=8andAr=64, while others do not. Speci\ufb01cally, \u0001Wv(resp. \u0001Wq) ofAr=8\nand\u0001Wv(resp. \u0001Wq) ofAr=64share a subspace of dimension 1 with normalized\nsimilarity>0:5, providing an explanation of why r= 1 performs quite well in our\ndownstream tasks for GPT-3.\nSince bothAr=8andAr=64are learned using the same pre-trained model, Figure 3 indicates that\nthe top singular-vector directions of Ar=8andAr=64are the most useful, while other directions\npotentially contain mostly random noises accumulated during training. Hence, the adaptation matrix\ncan indeed have a very low rank.\nSubspace similarity between different random seeds. We further con\ufb01rm this by plotting the\nnormalized subspace similarity between two randomly seeded runs with r= 64 , shown in Figure 4.\n\u0001Wqappears to have a higher \u201cintrinsic rank\u201d than \u0001Wv, since more common singular value direc-\ntions are learned by both runs for \u0001Wq, which is in line with our empirical observation in Table 6.\nAs a comparison, we also plot two random Gaussian matrices, which do not share any common\nsingular value directions with each other.\n7.3 H OWDOES THE ADAPTATION MATRIX \u0001WCOMPARE TO W?\nWe further investigate the relationship between \u0001WandW. In particular, does \u0001Whighly correlate\nwithW? (Or mathematically, is \u0001Wmostly contained in the top singular directions of W?) Also,\n7Note that a similar analysis can be carried out with Band the left-singular unitary matrices \u2013 we stick with\nAfor our experiments.\n11\n0.00.10.20.30.40.5\n1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n34\n39\n44\n49\n54\n59\nj1\n8\n16\n24\n32\n40\n48\n56iWq\n1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n34\n39\n44\n49\n54\n59\nj(Ar=64,A/primer=64,i,j)\nWv\n1\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n34\n39\n44\n49\n54\n59\njRandom GaussianFigure 4: Left and Middle: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=64\nfrom two random seeds, for both \u0001Wqand\u0001Wvin the 48-th layer. Right: the same heat-map\nbetween the column vectors of two random Gaussian matrices. See Section H.1 for other layers.\nhow \u201clarge\u201d is \u0001Wcomparing to its corresponding directions in W? This can shed light on the\nunderlying mechanism for adapting pre-trained language models.\nTo answer these questions, we project Wonto ther-dimensional subspace of \u0001Wby comput-\ningU>WV>, withU/Vbeing the left/right singular-vector matrix of \u0001W. Then, we com-\npare the Frobenius norm between kU>WV>kFandkWkF. As a comparison, we also compute\nkU>WV>kFby replacing U;V with the top rsingular vectors of Wor a random matrix.\nr= 4 r= 64\n\u0001WqWq Random \u0001WqWq Random\njjU>WqV>jjF= 0.32 21.67 0.02 1.90 37.71 0.33\njjWqjjF= 61:95jj\u0001WqjjF= 6:91jj\u0001WqjjF= 3:57\nTable 7: The Frobenius norm of U>WqV>whereUandVare the left/right top rsingular vector\ndirections of either (1) \u0001Wq, (2)Wq, or (3) a random matrix. The weight matrices are taken from\nthe 48th layer of GPT-3.\nWe draw several conclusions from Table 7. First, \u0001Whas a stronger correlation with Wcompared\nto a random matrix, indicating that \u0001Wampli\ufb01es some features that are already in W. Second,\ninstead of repeating the top singular directions of W,\u0001Wonly ampli\ufb01es directions that are not\nemphasized in W. Third, the ampli\ufb01cation factor is rather huge: 21:5\u00196:91=0:32forr= 4.\nSee Section H.4 for why r= 64 has a smaller ampli\ufb01cation factor. We also provide a visualization\nin Section H.3 for how the correlation changes as we include more top singular directions from Wq.\nThis suggests that the low-rank adaptation matrix potentially ampli\ufb01es the important features for\nspeci\ufb01c downstream tasks that were learned but not emphasized in the general pre-training model .\n8 C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\nFine-tuning enormous language models is prohibitively expensive in terms of the hardware required\nand the storage/switching cost for hosting independent instances for different tasks. We propose\nLoRA, an ef\ufb01cient adaptation strategy that neither introduces inference latency nor reduces input\nsequence length while retaining high model quality. Importantly, it allows for quick task-switching\nwhen deployed as a service by sharing the vast majority of the model parameters. While we focused\non Transformer language models, the proposed principles are generally applicable to any neural\nnetworks with dense layers.\nThere are many directions for future works. 1) LoRA can be combined with other ef\ufb01cient adapta-\ntion methods, potentially providing orthogonal improvement. 2) The mechanism behind \ufb01ne-tuning\nor LoRA is far from clear \u2013 how are features learned during pre-training transformed to do well\non downstream tasks? We believe that LoRA makes it more tractable to answer this than full \ufb01ne-\n12\ntuning. 3) We mostly depend on heuristics to select the weight matrices to apply LoRA to. Are\nthere more principled ways to do it? 4) Finally, the rank-de\ufb01ciency of \u0001Wsuggests that Wcould\nbe rank-de\ufb01cient as well, which can also be a source of inspiration for future works.\nREFERENCES\nArmen Aghajanyan, Luke Zettlemoyer, and Sonal Gupta.

However, in practice, we can often afford to curate a few thousand or more training\nexamples for performance-sensitive applications. As shown in Table 8, \ufb01ne-tuning improves the\nmodel performance drastically compared to few-shot learning on datasets large and small. We take\nthe GPT-3 few-shot result on RTE from the GPT-3 paper (Brown et al., 2020). For MNLI-matched,\nwe use two demonstrations per class and six in-context examples in total.\n16\nMethod MNLI-m (Val. Acc./%) RTE (Val.

Consequently,\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\nlatency. While as pointed out in R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\nhardware parallelism. We con\ufb01rm their observation with a similar latency study on GPT-2 medium\nand point out that there are scenarios, notably online inference where the batch size is small, where\nthe added latency can be signi\ufb01cant.\nWe measure the latency of a single forward pass on an NVIDIA Quadro RTX8000 by averaging\nover 100 trials. We vary the input batch size, sequence length, and the adapter bottleneck dimension\nr. We test two adapter designs: the original one by Houlsby et al. (2019), which we call AdapterH,\nand a recent, more ef\ufb01cient variant by Lin et al. (2020), which we call AdapterL. See Section 5.1\nfor more details on the designs. We plot the slow-down in percentage compared to the no-adapter\nbaseline in Figure 5.\n05101520253035\n0 10 100 250AdapterH rSeq Len = 128 Seq Len = 256 Seq Len = 512\n1 2 4 8 16 32\nBatch Size0 10 100 250AdapterL r\n1 2 4 8 16 32\nBatch Size1 2 4 8 16 32\nBatch Size\nFigure 5: Percentage slow-down of inference latency compared to the no-adapter ( r= 0) baseline.\nThe top row shows the result for AdapterHand the bottom row AdapterL. Larger batch size and\nsequence length help to mitigate the latency, but the slow-down can be as high as over 30% in an\nonline, short-sequence-length scenario. We tweak the colormap for better visibility.\nC D ATASET DETAILS\nGLUE Benchmark is a wide-ranging collection of natural language understanding tasks. It includes\nMNLI (inference, Williams et al. (2018)), SST-2 (sentiment analysis, Socher et al. (2013)), MRPC\n(paraphrase detection, Dolan & Brockett (2005)), CoLA (linguistic acceptability, Warstadt et al.\n(2018)), QNLI (inference, Rajpurkar et al. (2018)), QQP8(question-answering), RTE (inference),\n8https://quoradata.quora.com/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs\n17\nand STS-B (textual similarity, Cer et al. (2017)). The broad coverage makes GLUE benchmark a\nstandard metric to evaluate NLU models such as RoBERTa and DeBERTa. The individual datasets\nare released under different permissive licenses.\nWikiSQL is introduced in Zhong et al. (2017) and contains 56;355/8;421training/validation ex-\namples. The task is to generate SQL queries from natural language questions and table schemata.\nWe encode context as x=ftable schema ;querygand target as y=fSQLg. The dataset is release\nunder the BSD 3-Clause License.\nSAMSum is introduced in Gliwa et al. (2019) and contains 14;732/819training/test examples. It\nconsists of staged chat conversations between two people and corresponding abstractive summaries\nwritten by linguists. We encode context as \u201d nn\u201d concatenated utterances followed by a \u201d nnnn\u201d,\nand target as y=fsummaryg. The dataset is released under the non-commercial licence: Creative\nCommons BY-NC-ND 4.0.\nE2E NLG Challenge was \ufb01rst introduced in Novikova et al. (2017) as a dataset for training end-to-\nend, data-driven natural language generation systems and is commonly used for data-to-text evalua-\ntion. The E2E dataset consists of roughly 42;000training, 4;600validation, and 4;600test exam-\nples from the restaurant domain. Each source table used as input can have multiple references. Each\nsample input (x;y)consists of a sequence of slot-value pairs, along with a corresponding natural\nlanguage reference text. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.\nDART is an open-domain data-to-text dataset described in Nan et al. (2020). DART inputs are\nstructured as sequences of ENTITY \u2014 RELATION \u2014 ENTITY triples. With 82Kexamples in\ntotal, DART is a signi\ufb01cantly larger and more complex data-to-text task compared to E2E. The\ndataset is released under the MIT license.\nWebNLG is another commonly used dataset for data-to-text evaluation (Gardent et al., 2017). With\n22Kexamples in total WebNLG comprises 14 distinct categories, nine of which are seen during\ntraining. Since \ufb01ve of the 14 total categories are not seen during training, but are represented in\nthe test set, evaluation is typically broken out by \u201cseen\u201d categories (S), \u201cunseen\u201d categories (U)\nand \u201call\u201d (A). Each input example is represented by a sequence of SUBJECT \u2014 PROPERTY \u2014\nOBJECT triples. The dataset is released under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0.\nD H YPERPARAMETERS USED IN EXPERIMENTS\nD.1 R OBERT A\nWe train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. We sweep learning rate, number\nof training epochs, and batch size for LoRA. Following Liu et al. (2019), we initialize the LoRA\nmodules to our best MNLI checkpoint when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of the\nusual initialization; the pre-trained model stays frozen for all tasks. We report the median over 5\nrandom seeds; the result for each run is taken from the best epoch. For a fair comparison with the\nsetup in Houlsby et al. (2019) and Pfeiffer et al. (2021), we restrict the model sequence length to 128\nand used a \ufb01xed batch size for all tasks. Importantly, we start with the pre-trained RoBERTa large\nmodel when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and STS-B, instead of a model already adapted to MNLI.\nThe runs with this restricted setup are marked with y. See the hyperparameters used in our runs\nin Table 9.\nD.2 D EBERT A\nWe again train using AdamW with a linear learning rate decay schedule. Following He et al. (2021),\nwe tune learning rate, dropout probability, warm-up steps, and batch size. We use the same model\nsequence length used by (He et al., 2021) to keep our comparison fair. Following He et al. (2021),\nwe initialize the LoRA modules to our best MNLI checkpoint when adapting to MRPC, RTE, and\nSTS-B, instead of the usual initialization; the pre-trained model stays frozen for all tasks.

We tune learning rate for all method-dataset combinations. See Section D.4 for more\ndetails on the hyperparameters used. For pre\ufb01x-embedding tuning, we \ufb01nd the optimal lpandli\nto be 256 and 8, respectively, totalling 3:2Mtrainable parameters. We use lp= 8 andli= 8 for\npre\ufb01x-layer tuning with 20:2Mtrainable parameters to obtain the overall best performance. We\npresent two parameter budgets for LoRA: 4.7M ( rq=rv= 1orrv= 2) and 37.7M ( rq=rv= 8\norrq=rk=rv=ro= 2). We report the best validation performance from each run. The training\nhyperparameters used in our GPT-3 experiments are listed in Table 12.\nE C OMBINING LORA WITH PREFIX TUNING\nLoRA can be naturally combined with existing pre\ufb01x-based approaches. In this section, we evaluate\ntwo combinations of LoRA and variants of pre\ufb01x-tuning on WikiSQL and MNLI.\nLoRA+Pre\ufb01xEmbed (LoRA+PE) combines LoRA with pre\ufb01x-embedding tuning, where we insert\nlp+lispecial tokens whose embeddings are treated as trainable parameters. For more on pre\ufb01x-\nembedding tuning, see Section 5.1.\nLoRA+Pre\ufb01xLayer (LoRA+PL) combines LoRA with pre\ufb01x-layer tuning. We also insert lp+li\nspecial tokens; however, instead of letting the hidden representations of these tokens evolve natu-\n20\nHyperparameters Fine-Tune PreEmbed PreLayer BitFit AdapterHLoRA\nOptimizer AdamW\nBatch Size 128\n# Epoch 2\nWarmup Tokens 250,000\nLR Schedule Linear\nLearning Rate 5.00E-06 5.00E-04 1.00E-04 1.6E-03 1.00E-04 2.00E-04\nTable 12: The training hyperparameters used for different GPT-3 adaption methods. We use the\nsame hyperparameters for all datasets after tuning learning rate.\nrally, we replace them after every Transformer block with an input agnostic vector. Thus, both the\nembeddings and subsequent Transformer block activations are treated as trainable parameters. For\nmore on pre\ufb01x-layer tuning, see Section 5.1.\nIn Table 15, we show the evaluation results of LoRA+PE and LoRA+PL on WikiSQL and MultiNLI.\nFirst of all, LoRA+PE signi\ufb01cantly outperforms both LoRA and pre\ufb01x-embedding tuning on\nWikiSQL, which indicates that LoRA is somewhat orthogonal to pre\ufb01x-embedding tuning. On\nMultiNLI, the combination of LoRA+PE doesn\u2019t perform better than LoRA, possibly because LoRA\non its own already achieves performance comparable to the human baseline. Secondly, we notice\nthat LoRA+PL performs slightly worse than LoRA even with more trainable parameters. We at-\ntribute this to the fact that pre\ufb01x-layer tuning is very sensitive to the choice of learning rate and thus\nmakes the optimization of LoRA weights more dif\ufb01cult in LoRA+PL.\nF A DDITIONAL EMPIRICAL EXPERIMENTS\nF.1 A DDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON GPT-2\nWe also repeat our experiment on DART (Nan et al., 2020) and WebNLG (Gardent et al., 2017)\nfollowing the setup of Li & Liang (2021). The result is shown in Table 13. Similar to our result\non E2E NLG Challenge, reported in Section 5, LoRA performs better than or at least on-par with\npre\ufb01x-based approaches given the same number of trainable parameters.\nMethod # Trainable DART\nParameters BLEU\"MET\"TER#\nGPT-2 Medium\nFine-Tune 354M 46.2 0.39 0.46\nAdapterL0.37M 42.4 0.36 0.48\nAdapterL11M 45.2 0.38 0.46\nFTTop224M 41.0 0.34 0.56\nPrefLayer 0.35M 46.4 0.38 0.46\nLoRA 0.35M 47.1\u0006.2 0.39 0.46\nGPT-2 Large\nFine-Tune 774M 47.0 0.39 0.46\nAdapterL0.88M 45.7\u0006.1 0.38 0.46\nAdapterL23M 47.1\u0006.1 0.39 0.45\nPrefLayer 0.77M 46.7 0.38 0.45\nLoRA 0.77M 47.5\u0006.1 0.39 0.45\nTable 13: GPT-2 with different adaptation methods on DART.

The focus is on\nidentifying the trade-off between performance and the number of trainable parameters.\nF.3 L OW-DATA REGIME\nTo evaluate the performance of different adaptation approaches in the low-data regime. we randomly\nsample 100, 1k and 10k training examples from the full training set of MNLI to form the low-data\nMNLI-ntasks. In Table 16, we show the performance of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-\nn. To our surprise, Pre\ufb01xEmbed and Pre\ufb01xLayer performs very poorly on MNLI-100 dataset, with\nPre\ufb01xEmbed performing only slightly better than random chance (37.6% vs. 33.3%). Pre\ufb01xLayer\nperforms better than Pre\ufb01xEmbed but is still signi\ufb01cantly worse than Fine-Tune or LoRA on MNLI-\n100. The gap between pre\ufb01x-based approaches and LoRA/Fine-tuning becomes smaller as we in-\ncrease the number of training examples, which might suggest that pre\ufb01x-based approaches are not\nsuitable for low-data tasks in GPT-3. LoRA achieves better performance than \ufb01ne-tuning on both\nMNLI-100 and MNLI-Full, and comparable results on MNLI-1k and MNLI-10K considering the\n(\u00060:3) variance due to random seeds.\nThe training hyperparameters of different adaptation approaches on MNLI-n are reported in Ta-\nble 17. We use a smaller learning rate for Pre\ufb01xLayer on the MNLI-100 set, as the training loss does\nnot decrease with a larger learning rate.\nG M EASURING SIMILARITY BETWEEN SUBSPACES\nIn this paper we use the measure \u001e(A;B;i;j ) = (Ui\nA;Uj\nB) =kUi>\nAUBk2\nF\nminfi;jgto measure the subspace\nsimilarity between two column orthonormal matrices Ui\nA2Rd\u0002iandUj\nB2Rd\u0002j, obtained by\ntaking columns of the left singular matrices of AandB.

Using the E2E NLG Challenge\ndataset as an example, we report the validation loss and test metrics achieved by different choices\nofrafter training for 26,000 steps. We present our result in Table 18. The optimal rank for GPT-2\nMedium is between 4 and 16 depending on the metric used, which is similar to that for GPT-3 175B.\nNote that the relationship between model size and the optimal rank for adaptation is still an open\nquestion.\nH.3 C ORRELATION BETWEEN WAND \u0001W\nSee Figure 8 for the normalized subspace similarity between Wand\u0001Wwith varying r.\nNote again that \u0001Wdoes not contain the top singular directions of W, since the similarity between\nthe top 4 directions in \u0001Wand the top-10% of those in Wbarely exceeds 0.2. This gives evidence\nthat\u0001Wcontains those \u201ctask-speci\ufb01c\u201d directions that are otherwise notemphasized in W.\nAn interesting next question to answer, is how \u201cstrong\u201d do we need to amplify those task-speci\ufb01c\ndirections, in order for the model adaptation to work well?\n24\n0.00.20.40.60.81.0\n12345678Layer 1\niWq\n Wv\n Wq\n Wv\n12345678Layer 32\ni\n12345678Layer 64\ni\n1\n6\n12\n18\n23\n29\n35\n40\n46\n52\n58\nj12345678Layer 96\ni\n1\n6\n12\n18\n23\n29\n35\n40\n46\n52\n58\nj12345678\nj12345678\nj(Ar=8,Ar=64,i,j)\nFigure 6: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=8andAr=64for both\n\u0001Wqand\u0001Wvfrom the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Transformer.\nH.4 A MPLIFICATION FACTOR\nOne can naturally consider a feature ampli\ufb01cation factor as the ratiok\u0001WkF\nkU>WV>kF, whereUandV\nare the left- and right-singular matrices of the SVD decomposition of \u0001W. (RecallUU>WV>V\ngives the \u201cprojection\u201d of Wonto the subspace spanned by \u0001W.)\nIntuitively, when \u0001Wmostly contains task-speci\ufb01c directions, this quantity measures how much of\nthem are ampli\ufb01ed by \u0001W. As shown in Section 7.3, for r= 4, this ampli\ufb01cation factor is as large\nas 20. In other words, there are (generally speaking) four feature directions in each layer (out of the\nentire feature space from the pre-trained model W), that need to be ampli\ufb01ed by a very large factor\n20, in order to achieve our reported accuracy for the downstream speci\ufb01c task. And, one should\nexpect a very different set of feature directions to be ampli\ufb01ed for each different downstream task.\nOne may notice, however, for r= 64 , this ampli\ufb01cation factor is only around 2, meaning that\nmost directions learned in \u0001Wwithr= 64 arenotbeing ampli\ufb01ed by much. This should not\nbe surprising, and in fact gives evidence (once again) that the intrinsic rank needed to represent\nthe \u201ctask-speci\ufb01c directions\u201d (thus for model adaptation) is low. In contrast, those directions in the\nrank-4 version of \u0001W(corresponding to r= 4) are ampli\ufb01ed by a much larger factor 20.\n25\n0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.8\n1\n7\n13\n19\n25\n31\n37\n43\n49\n55\n61Layer 1\niWq\n Wv\nLayer 32Wq\n Wv\n1\n6\n11\n16\n21\n26\n31\n36\n41\n46\n51\n56\n61\nj1\n7\n13\n19\n25\n31\n37\n43\n49\n55\n61Layer 64\ni\n1\n6\n11\n16\n21\n26\n31\n36\n41\n46\n51\n56\n61\nj\n1\n6\n11\n16\n21\n26\n31\n36\n41\n46\n51\n56\n61\njLayer 96\n1\n6\n11\n16\n21\n26\n31\n36\n41\n46\n51\n56\n61\nj(Ar=64,A/primer=64,i,j)\nFigure 7: Normalized subspace similarity between the column vectors of Ar=64from two randomly\nseeded runs, for both \u0001Wqand\u0001Wvfrom the 1st, 32nd, 64th, and 96th layers in a 96-layer Trans-\nformer.\nRankrvalloss BLEU NIST METEOR ROUGE L CIDEr\n1 1.23 68.72 8.7215 0.4565 0.7052 2.4329\n2 1.21 69.17 8.7413 0.4590 0.7052 2.4639\n4 1.18 70.38 8.8439 0.4689 0.7186 2.5349\n8 1.17 69.57 8.7457 0.4636 0.7196 2.5196\n16 1.16 69.61 8.7483 0.4629 0.7177 2.4985\n32 1.16 69.33 8.7736 0.4642 0.7105 2.5255\n64 1.16 69.24 8.7174 0.4651 0.7180 2.5070\n128 1.16 68.73 8.6718 0.4628 0.7127 2.5030\n256 1.16 68.92 8.6982 0.4629 0.7128 2.5012\n512 1.16 68.78 8.6857 0.4637 0.7128 2.5025\n1024 1.17 69.37 8.7495 0.4659 0.7149 2.5090\nTable 18: Validation loss and test set metrics on E2E NLG Challenge achieved by LoRA with\ndifferent rank rusing GPT-2 Medium.

Had he been, he might have observed that undergraduate political science papers\nare subject to a di\u000berent logic. Really good papers are unique - each has its own particular\nthesis, style of argumentation, body of empirical evidence and set of conclusions. Really\nbad papers, in contrast, tend toward a dismal uniformity. They draw on the same evidence\n(garbled versions of what the professor has presented in class), are organized according to\nsimilar principles of incoherence, and all wend their eventual ways towards banal conclu-\nsions that strenuously avoid making any claims or positive arguments whatsoever.\nThis short set of guidelines cannot make you into a really good essayist. For that you\nneed time, practice, and native genius. What it can do, however, is help you avoid some\nof the most common pitfalls of undergraduate essay writers. You can surely avoid being a\nvery bad essayist, and you can very likely become a better essayist than you are already.\nWhat follows is a short set of suggestions, accompanied, where available, with cautionary\nexamples drawn from online essay mills.\nRead the Requirements for the Assignment\nThis suggestion may be taken as insulting because it is so obvious; still, it is commonly\nignored in practice. The professor usually drops some very strong hints about what she\nis looking for when she assigns a piece of writing. It is best to pay attention to those\nhints. For example, if you are asked to write a term paper on a problem of international\ncooperation, you should ensure that your term paper explicitly focuses on a topic that (a)\ninvolves cooperation, (b) has, at the least, some international aspect, and (c) is potentially\nproblematic.\nSometimes, assignments are ambiguous. Professors too may err. The assignment may\nbe inexactly worded or involve contradictory requirements. In these cases it is obviously\nbest to ask the professor what she is looking for (it is often better to ask via email, to\nensure that you have a written explanation of what the professor wants that you can refer\nto later). Where this is not possible (e.g. if you are trying to write an exam answer), you\nmay want to be quite clear in saying how you are interpreting the question. For example,\nyou might want to start by saying \\In this answer, I interpret the phrase `international\ncooperation' to mean . . . \" If your interpretation is a reasonable one, this places the onus\non the professor to either read the essay according to your interpretation or to justify (at\nleast to herself) why not.\n1I am grateful to Marty Finnemore and the readers of Crooked Timber and the Monkey Cage for\ncomments on this essay.\n2\nAvoid Data Dumps\nPoor essays very often ignore the question asked in a quite speci\fc way. The student spots\nsome topic in the assignment that seems familiar, and immediately sets about writing an\nessay which tells the professor everything they know about that topic, in no particular\norder. For obvious reasons, such essays rarely receive high grades. Universities encourage\n(or, at least, they should encourage) students in the social sciences and liberal humanities\nto criticize, to analyze, and, ideally, to think. Mere demonstration that one possesses a\ndisorganized body of knowledge on a topic, and is prepared to in\rict this jumble upon the\nprofessor in printed or (worse) handwritten form, suggests that this encouragement has\nfallen on untilled ground.\nCut to the Chase\nUndergraduate essays frequently begin with an extended session of throat-clearing irrele-\nvances and vague generalities. They talk about everything except the question that has\nbeen asked. Take this example (drawn from a free term paper).\nThe onset of computers on the general population has given a boost to\nthe Economy in the world's market. People who weren't much aware of the\nworld became drawn to computers, which in turn brought about the Internet,\nconnecting the world all over. The Internet has played a major role in the\nlives of people all over the world. Now, it is not limited to just important\norganizations or governments. Everyone who owns a computer is logged on to\nthe Internet; and this has made the world seem smaller. No one has to wait\nfor the postman to deliver the mail, but instead one can just connect to the\nInternet and right away, you got mail.\nThis, like many other essays that I have corrected on the political consequences of the\nInternet (I sometimes teach a course on this topic) begins with a paragraph that has nothing\nwhatsoever to say about the politics of the Internet. Instead, the paper's author sees the\nword `Internet' and grabs desperately for banalities that he associates with this word.\nAlternatively, students sometimes state and re-state the question in a manner intended\nto suggest that they understand it, without ever providing anything so provocative as an\nactual answer.\nShould the internet be censored ? The internet is a wonderful place for\nentertainment and education, but, like all places used by millions of people, it\nhas some pecularities that lead to a lot of talking and arguing over, should the\ninternet be censored? Most of people who use the internet are furious about\nthe censorship on the internet. The issue of whether is it necessary to censor\nthe internet is being argued all over the world.\n3\nThis essay starts o\u000b well. It sets out a short, pithy question that the reader might hope\nwill be answered in the paper. But then it goes horribly, horribly wrong. The second\nsentence restates the \frst, garnished with a couple of irrelevant commonplaces. The third\nsentence suggests that there is controversy surrounding the topic of Internet censorship (a\nsafe guess, given that the writer has been asked to write a paper about this controversy).\nThe fourth sentence repeats the third. And so on. The writer evidently knows little or\nnothing about the essay topic, and is trying to conceal that fact. Unfortunately, he or she\nis failing.\nThese are the beginning sections of very bad essays. Most undergraduate essays are not\nnearly as bad as that. Still, many essays do begin with weak and meandering introductions\nthat do not address the topic of their paper. This is a shame. It is important that you get\nthe introduction right. This is your best opportunity to grab the reader's attention and to\npersuade her that you have something interesting to say. Don't waste it.\nBy the time the reader has \fnished reading the \frst two sentences, she should know\nwhich question the essay addresses. By the time the reader has \fnished reading the \frst\n\fve or six, she should have a pretty good idea of how the author is going to tackle the\nquestion. The following provides one example of a punchy beginning (nb: this is not taken\nfrom an essay mill):\nShould the Internet be censored? While many Americans would say no,\nthere is in fact a very good case for limited Internet censorship. Pedophiles can\nuse the Internet to \fnd each other and to swap child pornography. Terrorists\ncan use the Internet to propagandize for their beliefs, and to recruit for their\ncauses. Neo-Nazis and others can spread disinformation to the gullible, and\npersuade them that the Holocaust never occurred. In this essay, I argue that\nsome kinds of Internet speech (child pornography, terrorist recruitment and\nhate speech) should be banned. I acknowledge that this may hurt legitimate\nforms of free speech if they become confused with the harmful kinds, but show\nthat the bene\fcial consequences of banning bad speech outweigh the harmful\nconsequences of accidentally banning (some) good speech.\nThis is, in my opinion, a good opening paragraph (since I wrote it myself as an illus-\ntration, it is perhaps unsurprising that I like it). It immediately states the question that\nthe essay will try to answer. Shortly afterwards, it provides the reader with the proposed\nanswer, and brie\ry describes the kind of evidence that it will use to support this answer.\nThe introduction also acknowledges that there is a strong opposing case (that banning\n`harmful' speech will hurt other kinds of speech), and promises that it will try to answer\nthat case. The essay will not necessarily convince its readers (it takes a quite controversial\nstand), but it does signal to the reader that it has a clear question, a clear answer to that\nquestion, and a willingness to address the best arguments against the case it is making.\nThat is all that any professor may reasonably ask for; not that she agree with the writer's\n4\nargument and conclusions, but that she recognizes them as well written, well structured,\nand well supported by the evidence.\nOrganize, Organize, Organize\nMany student papers are badly organized. They wander from point to point. They tack\nan introduction and conclusion onto a main body that does not have any internal system\nof order. Or they do not have a distinguishable introduction, body, and conclusion at all.\nSome excellent essayists can get away with apparently disorganized writing. It is usually\na very bad idea to try to emulate them. Very often, apparently disorganized work is in fact\nhighly organized. The author has merely kicked away the essay's supports and sca\u000bolding\n(e.g. an explicit introductory section and so on) as soon as it was strong enough to stand\non its own. Sometimes, apparent disorganization is instead the product of a highly subtle\nmind, or of an elliptical writing style that approaches its topics indirectly rather than\ndirectly. Unless you are very con\fdent indeed (and have evidence in the form of past work,\nprint publications etc to justify this con\fdence) I strongly recommend that you avoid overly\nclever and non-linear approaches to writing. They require a lot of practice (usually at the\nmore traditional sorts of writing) before they can be carried o\u000b well, and when they are\ncarried o\u000b badly, they are very bad indeed. Genius may do as it will; mere intelligence and\ntalent should be appropriately modest in their ambitions.\nThus, the need for structure . You should structure your essay at three levels.\nMacro-structure\nThis is the broad structure of the essay itself. Unless you feel very comfortable that you\nare an excellent writer, it is usually best to stick to the traditional frame of an introductory\nsection, a main body, and a conclusion. The introduction tells the reader what you are\ngoing to say. The main body tells the reader what you are saying. The conclusions tell the\nreader what she has just read (perhaps adding some thoughts as to its broader implications\nif you are feeling adventurous).\nThis not only helps the reader understand your argument, but disciplines your thought\nand prose. It forces you to begin your essay with a clear, concise account of your major\nclaims. When you write the main section of the essay (or re-write it, as needs be) the\nintroduction will provide you with a roadmap of what you need to do. Your conclusions, in\ncontrast, should draw the threads together, showing how the facts and arguments you have\nlaid out in the main body actually speak to the broad themes discussed in the introduction,\nand drawing the threads of your narrative together into a proper whole. Of course, for this\nto work it is necessary that the main body of your essay actually speak to the arguments\nlaid out in your introduction, that your conclusions relate to the main body, and so on.\nMeso-structure\nThis is perhaps the most commonly neglected element of structured writing. It concerns\nthe paragraphs into which your prose is organized. Each paragraph should focus on one\nmain point. The point of each paragraph should build on that in the previous paragraph,\n5\nand create the foundations of the next. Each paragraph should be a necessary part of the\noverall structure of your essay.\nI \fnd that a useful mental exercise is to boil down the arguments of each paragraph,\none after the other, into single sentences. Then, put all these sentences together into a\nconsecutive narrative, looking to see whether each sentence can be made to \row naturally\nfrom the sentence previous to it, and into the sentence following. This will highlight any\nmajor structural problems. If you are not able to boil down each of the paragraphs into\na single sentence summary (however simplistic), then the o\u000bending paragraphs most likely\nneed to be rewritten more clearly. If there are gaps or non-sequiturs when you put the\none sentence summaries together, then the meso-structure of your essay needs to be re-\norganized, by cutting and pasting paragraphs, or by introducing new paragraphs to \fll the\ngaps, or deleting old paragraphs that detract from the \row of your argument.\nMicro-structure\nWhat is true of the paragraph is also true of the sentence. Each individual sentence\nshould \row in a logical and obvious way from the sentence before, and into the sentence\nafter. Consider the following paragraph, taken from a term paper on global warming which\nis available for free online.\nWeather these days has become very unpredictable. The increase in the\nworld's temperatures, believed to be caused in part by the greenhouse e\u000bect\nwhich is known as global warming has and will have a serious e\u000bect on the\nfuture. Global warming creates massive concerns for the entire earth. If the\nheat continues to increase several species may struggle to survive. There are\nnumerous political, environmental, economic, and social issues when it comes\nto global warming. Global warming is an inevitable issue and by no stretch of\nthe imagination can be slowed down easily. There is an inconceivable amount\nof causes that connect to global warming.\nThis is quite wretched writing. The \frst sentence is a vague generality that does not\nmean very much. The second sentence does not \row in any obvious way from the \frst.\nWhat does the greenhouse e\u000bect have to do with unpredictable weather? No explanation\nis provided for the reader. The third sentence merely repeats the argument of the second,\nwith greater rhetorical alarm. The fourth does a little better, but loses force because it\nis so badly written (the claim that `several species' may struggle to survive suggests that\nonly \fve or six species are in danger, which sits awkwardly with the previous sentence's\nsuggestion that global warming causes \\massive concerns\" for the entire earth). The \ffth\nsentence seems to build a new set of claims, and should be at the beginning of a new\nparagraph. However, it never goes anywhere. Instead, the sixth sentence warns that global\nwarming is \\an inevitable issue\" (whatever that means), while the seventh sentence wrings\nits hands in despair over yet another new claim - that there is an \\inconceivable amount\"\n(sic) of causes \\that connect\" to global warming. These sentences are not only bad in\n6\nthemselves - they are not connected in any logical or orderly way. The result is that they\ndo not add up to a coherent argument.\nExercises in Style\nPolitical science is not a discipline notable for lovely prose. The best historians often\nwrite beautifully; the best political scientists rarely do. Good political science writing\ndoes not require striking metaphors or clever verbal constructions (while these are not\nprecisely discouraged, they are not commonly regarded as necessary). Instead, it requires\nsimple, direct writing, which communicates its arguments and evidence as clearly and\nunambiguously as possible.\nThe implications for prose style are straightforward.\nFirst, use direct language when at all possible. This not only reads better; it communi-\ncates clearly who is responsible for what. For example, the sentence\nThe Iranian government censors newspapers and political websites.\nnot only reads much better than\nNewspapers and political websites are subject to a censorship regime in Iran.\nbut it conveys more information in fewer words. It tells the reader who is responsible for\ncensoring information (the government). The alternative version provides less information\n(the reader may guess that the government is responsible for censorship, but she cannot\nbe sure). It also sounds cumbersome and laborious. Students sometimes use indirect\nconstructions or the passive voice rather than direct language and active verbs because\nthey think this will make their writing more sophisticated and `academic.' They are wrong.\nEven worse, they sometimes prefer indirect language because they believe that it allows\nthem get away with knowing less, by fudging their argument so that it can be interpreted\nin more than one way. Neither are good reasons. Indirect language often sounds weak,\nuncertain, and bureaucratic, and experienced readers will recognize when it is being used\nto bamboozle them. Sometimes, passive and indirect writing is appropriate, but it should\nbe used with caution.\nSecond, prefer simple words to complex words, and plain language to jargon. Sometimes\nit will be impossible to avoid jargon or obscure terms. However, it will usually be possible\nto use simple terms to convey your meaning. When you can do so, do so. Plain language\nmakes life easier for the reader. It also makes it harder for the writer to get away with\nnonsense. If you use \rowery language, you can sometimes persuade yourself that you\nunderstand topics and debates which you really do not. If you use plain language you will\nbe forced to confront your areas of weak understanding and to rectify them.\nThird, prefer straightforward sentence structures to complex ones. Again, simple sen-\ntences usually read better. Some writers (the historian Edward Gibbon is a \fne example)\n7\ncan use complex sentence structure to convey irony and secondary meaning. You - unless\nyou have grown up conversant with a prose tradition like Gibbon's, in which case you have\nno need whatsoever to read primers like this - probably cannot. You should typically prefer\nsimple sentences with the bare minimum of sub-clauses needed to convey your argument.\nFormless and incoherent sentences usually suggest formless and incoherent thought, and\nindeed they may plausibly cause intellectual incoherence. If you reduce your language down\nto plain, simple sentences with clear structure then you will again be less likely to hide any\nlack of understanding from the reader and yourself.\nConclusion\nWriting good political science essays is not as hard as it seems. It does not require verbal\ncreativity so much as an ordered and disciplined mind. Most obviously and simply, you\nshould read and understand the essay assignment. You should begin by grabbing the\nattention of the reader with a clear statement of the question that you wish to answer,\nand how you wish to answer it. You should ensure that your essay is structured and well\norganized, so that each part does its part, and \fts together well with the other parts.\nFinally, you should ensure that your prose style does not get in the way of clear thinking\nand clear exposition. If you adhere to these simple rules, you are not guaranteed to write\na good essay. Noset of mechanical rules can provide such a guarantee. You will, however,\navoid the basic mistakes that have plagued 80% of the bad political science essays that I\nhave read over my nine years of teaching."

It goes further than identifying the objects in an image, and instead, it attempts to understand the scene.\nSolutions to this problem form the underpinning of a range of tasks, including image captioning, visual question answering(VQA), and image retrieval. Graphs provide a natural way to represent the relational arrangement between objects in an\nimage, and thus, in recent years graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a standard component of many 2D image\nunderstanding pipelines, becoming a core architectural component, especially in the VQA group of tasks. In this survey, wereview this rapidly evolving \ufb01eld and we provide a taxonomy of graph types used in 2D image understanding approaches,\na comprehensive list of the GNN models used in this domain, and a roadmap of future potential developments. To the best\nof our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst comprehensive survey that covers image captioning, visual question answering, and imageretrieval techniques that focus on using GNNs as the main part of their architecture.\nKeywords Graph neural networks \u00b7Image captioning \u00b7Visual question answering \u00b7Image retrieval\n1 Introduction\nRecent years have seen an explosion of research into graph\nneural networks (GNNs), with a \ufb02urry of new architecturesbeing presented in top-tier machine learning conferences and\njournals every year [ 1\u20137]. The ability of GNNs to learn\nin non-Euclidean domains makes them powerful tools toanalyse data where structure plays an important role, from\nchemoinformatics [ 8] to network analysis [ 9]. Indeed, these\nmodels can also be applied to problems not traditionally asso-\nB Henry Senior\nh.senior@qmul.ac.uk\nGregory Slabaugh\ng.slabaugh@qmul.ac.uk\nShanxin Yuan\nshanxin.yuan@qmul.ac.uk\nLuca Rossi\nluca.rossi@polyu.edu.hk\n1Digital Environment Research Institute, Queen MaryUniversity London, New Road, London E1 1HH, UK\n2Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, TheHong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Kowloon,Hong Kongciated with graphs such as 3D object detection in LiDAR\npoint clouds [ 10] and shape analysis [ 11].\nGNN-based approaches have gained increasing popularity\nfor solving 2D image understanding Vision-Language tasks,similar to other domains [ 12\u201314]. Whilst advances in this\ndomain are discussed in [ 15], it is a wide ranging survey. Our\nwork focuses speci\ufb01cally on Vision-Language and thereforecovers these topics more extensively.\nWe view 2D image understanding as the high-level chal-\nlenge of making a computer understand a two-dimensionalimage to a level equal to or greater than a human. Models that\nenable this should be able to reason about the image in order\nto describe it (image captioning), explain aspects of it (visualquestion answering (VQA), or \ufb01nd similar images (imageretrieval). These are all tasks that humans can do with relative\nease; however, they are incredibly dif\ufb01cult for deep learn-\ning models and require a large amount of data. These tasksalso fall under the category of Vision-Language problems, as\nthey require the model to have an understanding of both the\nimage pixels and a language (typically English) in which themodels can express their understanding. Adjacent to these is\nthe challenging task of Vision-Language Navigation [ 16\u201321],\ni.e. the development of a system able to navigate a previouslyunseen environment using natural language instructions from\n123\nH. Senior et al.\na human and its own visual observations. Combining Vision,\nNLP, Agents, and potentially Robotics, it is a task that mergestogether a broad set of \ufb01elds. Given the task breadth and\ndepth, and its strong links to Agents and Robotics, it falls\noutside the scope of this survey. Readers are directed to therecent survey by Wu et al. [ 22] for in-depth reviews of this\ntask. GNNs also have a wide range of applications within\nthe medical imaging domain [ 23\u201325], including the genera-\ntion of medical reports through the utilisation of knowledgegraphs [ 23\u201325] (an extension of the image captioning task).\nThey have also been used in medical VQA [ 26] and medical\nimage retrieval [ 27].\nWhilst there is a plethora of techniques that have been\napplied to the tasks discussed in this survey [ 28\u201337], this sur-\nvey focuses on graph-based approaches. There are a rangeof graphs that are applicable, but the most widely used andunderstood is the semantic graph [ 38,39]. This graph is\nconstructed of nodes representing visual objects and edges\nrepresenting the semantic relationships between them. Thesemantic graph as well as further graph types are discussed\nin Sect. 2.3.\nAlongside a taxonomy of the graph types used across 2D\nimage understanding tasks, this paper contributes a much\nneeded overview of these approaches. Covering the three\nmain tasks, we also include an overview of popular GNNtechniques as well as insights on the direction of future GNNwork. In the discussion section of this paper, we argue that the\nincreasingly popular Transformer architecture [ 40] is actu-\nally a special case GNN [ 41]. We expand upon this argument\nto suggest that GNNs should not be overlooked as they may\noffer better inductive biases for a range of tasks.\nOur main contributions are: (1) a taxonomy of the graph\ntypes used in 2D image understanding tasks; (2) a compre-\nhensive survey of GNN-based approaches to common 2D\nimage understanding tasks; and (3) a roadmap of potentialfuture developments for the community to explore.\nThe remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2\ngives a taxonomy of the tasks discussed and their corre-\nsponding datasets, as well as an overview of the differentgraph types used throughout. Section 3gives an overview of\nthe common GNN architectures used. It also brie\ufb02y men-\ntions current and future research directions for GNNs andsignposts appropriate surveys. The main body of the paper\nis formed of Sects. 4,5, and 6, which detail GNN-based\napproaches to image captioning, VQA, and image retrieval,respectively. We then conclude the paper with a three part dis-cussion, with Sect. 7.1covering the advantages that GNNs\nstill offer despite the rapid adoption of the Transformer\narchitecture. This is followed by Sect. 7.2which links the\nemerging \ufb01eld of latent diffusion and image generation to\nimage captioning. Finally, Sect. 7.3concludes the paper and\nprovides potential directions for future work.2D Vision-\nLanguage TasksImage Captioning\nVisual Question\nAnswering\nImage RetrievalRetrieval-based\nCaptioning\nTemplate-based\nCaptioning\nDeep Learning-\nbased Captioning\nStandard Visual\nQuestion\nAnswering\nKnowledge-based\nVisual Question\nAnswering\nText Visual\nQuestion\nAnswering\nContent-based\nImage Retrieval\nSketch-based\nImage Retrieval\nText-based Image\nRetrieval\nSemantic Image\nRetrieval\nAnnotation-based\nImage Retrieval\nFig. 1 2D vision-language methodological taxonomy\n2 Background and de\ufb01nitions\nIn this section, we outline the background required to view\nthis survey in context.

Finally, we give\nan overview of the various graph types.\n2.1 2D vision-language tasks taxonomies\nThis paper follows the taxonomies of [ 42\u201345] and joins\nthem together for a more complete overview of 2D Vision-\nLanguage tasks (see Fig. 1). This section gives a brief\noverview of the existing taxonomies and highlights the sec-\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\ntions of them this survey focuses on. It also highlights the\nmain datasets used for various tasks discussed in the paper,and these are summarised in Table 1.\nWhilst individual Vision-Language tasks have their own\nunique datasets, they are uni\ufb01ed by the Visual Genome [ 46],\nan expansive dataset that provides ground truths for a rangeof Vision-Language tasks. As the most generic dataset, it has\n33,877 object categories and 68 ,111 attribute categories. At\nthe time of its publication, this was the largest and most densedataset containing image descriptions, objects, attributes,\nrelationships, and question\u2013answer pairs. Additionally, the\nVisual Genome also contains region graphs, semantic graphs,and question\u2013answer pairs. This results in it being a very wide\nranging dataset with lots of applications in visual cognition\ntasks such as scene graph generation [ 54] and VQA [ 55].\nFor image captioning, we follow [ 42] who identify three\nmain approaches: 1) retrieval-based captioning, the task of\nmapping an input image to an existing caption; 2) template-\nbased captioning, using image features to complete a captiontemplate; and 3) deep learning-based captioning, where the\ncaption is generated from scratch. Retrieval-based caption-\ning is built on the assumption that for every image, a captionexists, and needs to be retrieved from a bank of existing\ncaptions. It was the foundation of early image captioning\napproaches [ 28] and yielded good results without the need\nfor deep learning. However, not all images may have appro-priate captions. If the captions are generic, they will only\nbe able to describe aspects of an image and may omit its\nmost important feature. In contrast, template-based caption-ing [ 56] uses a prede\ufb01ned caption format and uses object\ndetection to \ufb01ll in the blanks. This approach is good for gen-\nerating consistent captions, but can result in captions that areunnatural and clearly generated by a machine. Contemporary\napproaches to the task of image captioning are based on deep\nlearning models. Early work focused on a CNN encoder feed-ing an RNN-based decoder [ 57]; however, more recent deep\nlearning approaches have developed to incorporate a wide\nvariety of techniques including GNNs [ 39,58] and Trans-\nformers [ 59,60]. In this survey, we focus speci\ufb01cally on deep\nlearning approaches to image captioning and focus on graph-\nbased approaches. Deep learning approaches are typically\ntrained on the COCO [ 47] or Flickr30k [ 48] which contain\na set of images accompanied by \ufb01ve human generated cap-\ntions. Closely related to contemporary deep learning-based\ncaptioning are the tasks of paragraph captioning and videocaptioning. Paragraph image captioning is the challenge ofgenerating a multi-sentence description of an image [ 61,62],\nwhilst video captioning focuses on describing videos. Read-\ners interested in video captioning are directed to the recentsurvey [ 63].\nTaxonomies of VQA are usually de\ufb01ned through the lens\nof the datasets used by the various tasks [ 43,44]. Here we\nfocus on 1) the standard VQA task of answering a ques-tion about an image, 2) the fact-based VQA (FVQA) task\nof answering questions that require external knowledge toanswer, and 3) TextVQA, the task of answering questions\nthat require the model to read text in the scene and com-\nbine it with visual data. Each of the various VQA taskshave their own set of speicalised datasets. The original VQAdataset [ 49] and the subsequently updated VQA 2.0 [ 64]\ndataset address the original task of answering questions\nbased on the visual information in the image. The FVQAdataset [ 50] is built using images from ImageNet [ 65] and\nCOCO [ 47] alongside facts from DBPedia [ 66], ConceptNet\n[67], and WebChild [ 68]. The images have three forms of\nvisual concepts extracted from them using a range of models.\nThese visual concepts include objects (items identi\ufb01ed in the\nimage), scene (scene-level features such as room label), andactions. Question\u2013answer pairs were generated by humanannotators who selected a visual concept and an accompa-\nnying fact triplet which they used to generate a question.\nFinally, the text-KVQA dataset [ 53] was built by compiling\nimages from a Kaggle movie poster challenge,\n1[69], and\nGoogle Image search results from combining brand names\nwith post\ufb01xes such as \u2018store\u2019 or \u2018building\u2019. This collectionof images was then given to human annotators who removed\nimages that did not contain text of brand names. The result\nis a dataset of 257K images with three groupings: book,movie, and scene. Accompanying these images are 1.3 mil-lion question\u2013answer pairs. Each image grouping gets its own\ntriplet-based knowledge base from a relevant source: Wiki-\nData [ 70], IMBd, and [ 69], respectively. Adjacent to the task\nof VQA and its sub-tasks is the \ufb01eld of Visual Grounding\n(sometimes known as Referring Expression). This is the task\nof identifying the salient regions of an image based on a natu-ral language query. Although the task is closely aligned with\nVQA, it falls outside the scope of this paper. We direct the\nreaders to [ 15].\nImage retrieval spans multiple tasks, all of which make\nuse of deep learning in contemporary approaches. We follow\nthe taxonomy of Alexander et al. [ 45] and address the fol-\nlowing sub-tasks: 1) text-based image retrieval where imagesare returned based on a text query; 2) content-based image\nretrieval where images are retrieved based on their simi-\nlarity to an input image; 3) sketch-based retrieval, whereimages are retrieved based on their similarity to a sketch;\n4) semantic-based retrieval which returns images based on\ntheir perceptual content; and 5) annotation-based retrieval,where images are returned using meta-data annotations. Thenumber of datasets used for image retrieval are vast, and the\ncommunity has not solidi\ufb01ed around a single dataset in the\nway image captioning has around COCO [ 47]. This presents\na challenge when making accurate comparisons between sys-\n1https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/neha1703/movie-genre-from-its-\nposter\n123\nH.

Whilst\nimage retrieval speci\ufb01c datasets exist [ 71], there are papers\n[72\u201374] that make use of image captioning datasets [ 47,48],\nshowing the wide range of varied datasets that exist for imageretrieval.\nUnderstanding the inherent biases in datasets is incredi-\nbly important for deep learning researchers and practitioners.As models move beyond research benchmarks and into\nmainstream use, models that are trained on biased data\nwill produce biased outputs and may contribute to theproliferation of harmful stereotypes. Within the scope of\nVision-Language, work has been done to discover negative\nbiases in core datasets such as COCO, enabling researchersto mitigate these risks [ 75]. Comprehensively demonstrated\nthe gender, racial, and Western biases that exist in the COCO\n[47] dataset. The research \ufb01nds lighter-skinned individuals\nare 7.5\u00d7more common than darker-skinned individuals,\nand males are 2 \u00d7more common than females. This leads\nto the concern that image captioning models may come to\nsee the world as being predominantly occupied by light-skinned males. Worryingly, [ 75] also \ufb01nd the existence of\nracial slurs in the ground truth captions which leads to con-\ncerns about captioning models producing captions containingthis derogatory language.\nHirota et al. [ 76] continue the work of [ 75] but focus on\nVQA datasets. They \ufb01nd evidence of bias in Visual Genome\n[46] and OK-VQA [ 51], two widely used VQA datasets. The\nbiases include a re\ufb02ection of traditional gender stereotypes\nand a US-centric viewpoint on race and nationality.\nIn addition to the gender and racial biases in existing\nVision-Language datasets, a lot of the datasets are limited\nby style. The vast majority of datasets contain real world\nphotographs (typically mined from Flickr), which limitsmodels to only understanding photographs. This limitationis most signi\ufb01cant in image captioning and image retrieval\nas the style is a signi\ufb01cant component of either the captionor retrieval query. Unless the question asked is speci\ufb01cally\nabout the style of the image, then the impact is somewhat\nlimited for VQA.\n2.2 Fundamental graph theoretical concepts\nUndirected graph. We de\ufb01ne an undirected graph Gto be a\ntuple of sets VandE, i.e. G=(V,E).T h es e t Vcontains n\nvertices (sometimes referred to as nodes) that are connected\nby the edges in the set E, i.e. if v\u2208Vand u\u2208Vare\nconnected by an edge then ev,u\u2208E. For an undirected graph,\nwe have that ev,u=eu,v.\nDirected graph A directed graph is a graph where the exis-\ntence of ev,udoes not imply the existence of eu,vas well. Let\nAbe the n\u00d7nbinary adjacency matrix such that Av,u=1i f\nev,u\u2208E. Then it follows that Ais asymmetric (symmetric)\nfor directed (undirected) graphs. More in general, Acan be a\nreal-valued matrix, where the value of Av,ucan be interpreted\nas the strength of the connection between vandu.\nNeighbourhood. The neighbourhood N(v)of a vertex v\u2208V\nis the subset of nodes in Vthat are connected to v.T h e\nneighbour ucan be either directly connected to v, i.e.(v,u)\u2208\nE, or indirectly connected by traversing redges from vto\nu. Note that some de\ufb01nitions include vitself as part of the\nneighbourhood.\nComplete graph. A complete graph is one (directed or undi-\nrected) where for each vertex, there is an edge connecting it\nto every other vertex in the set V. A complete graph is there-\nfore a graph with the maximum number of edges for a givennumber of nodes.\nMulti-partite graph. A multi-partite graph (also known as K-\npartite graph) is a graph where the nodes can be separated into\nKdifferent sets. For scene understanding tasks, this allows\nfor a graph representation where one set of nodes representobjects and another represents relationship between objects.\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nMulti-modal graph. A multi-modal graph is one with nodes\nthat have features from different modalities. This approachis commonly used in VQA where the image and text modali-\nties are mixed. Multi-modal graphs enable visual features to\ncoexist in a graph with word embeddings.\n2.3 Common graph types in 2D vision-language\ntasks\nThis section organises the various graph types used across\nall three tasks discussed in the survey. Some graphs, such\nas the semantic and spatial graphs, are used across all tasks[39,55,73], whilst others are more domain speci\ufb01c, like the\nknowledge graph [ 53,77]. Figure 2shows a sample image\nfrom the COCO dataset [ 47] together with various types of\ngraphs that can be used to describe it. This section, along-side the \ufb01gure, is organised so that graph that represent a\nsingle image and graphs that represent portions the dataset\nare grouped together.\nSemantic graph, multi-partite semantic graph, and textual\nsemantic graph. Sometimes referred to as a scene graph, a\nsemantic graph (shown in Fig. 2b) is a one that encapsulates\nthe semantic relationships between visual objects within a\nscene. Across the literature, the terms \u2018semantic graph\u2019 and\n\u2018scene graph\u2019 are used somewhat interchangeably, depend-ing on the paper. However, in this survey we use the term\n\u2018semantic graph\u2019 because there are many ways to describe a\nvisual scene as a graph, whereas the \u2018semantic graph\u2019 labelis more precise about what the graph represents. Seman-\ntic graphs come in different \ufb02avours. One approach is to\nde\ufb01ne a directed graph with nodes representing visual objectsextracted by an object detector such as Faster-RCNN [ 78]\nand edges representing semantic relationships between them.\nThis is the approach of Yao et al. [ 39], where, using a dataset\nsuch as Visual Genome [ 46], a model predicts the seman-\ntic relationships to form edges in the graph. Alternatively,\nthe semantic graph can be seen as a multi-partite graph [ 58,\n79\u201381]( s h o w ni nF i g . 2c), where attribute nodes describe\nthe object nodes they are linked to. They also change the\nway relationships are represented by using nodes rather than\nedge features. This yields a semantic graph with three nodetypes: visual object, object attribute, and inter-object relation-ship. This de\ufb01nition follows that of the \u2018scene graph\u2019 de\ufb01ned\nby Johnson et al. [ 38]. Finally, another form of semantic\ngraph exists, the textual semantic graph[ 58,82] (shown in\nFig. 2d). Unlike visual semantic graphs, textual ones are not\ngenerated from the image itself but rather its caption. Speci\ufb01-\ncally, the caption is parsed through the Stanford DependencyParser [ 83], a widely used [ 84,85] probabilistic sentence\nparser. Given a caption, the parser will return its grammati-\ncal structure, identifying components such nouns, verbs, andadjectives and marking the relationship between them. Thisis then modi\ufb01ed from a tree into a graph, following the tech-\nniques outlined in [ 86].\nSpatial graph. Yao et al. [ 39] de\ufb01ne a spatial graph (Fig. 2e)\nas one representing the spatial relationship between objects.Visual objects detected by an object detector form nodes,\nand the edges between the nodes represent one of 11 prede-\n\ufb01ned spatial relationships that may occur between the twoobjects. These include inside (labelled \u20181\u2019), cover (labelled\n\u20182\u2019), overlap (labelled \u20183\u2019), and eight positional relationships\n(labelled \u20184\u2019\u2013\u201811\u2019) based on the angle between the centroidof the two objects. These graphs are directional but will not\nalways be complete as there are cases where two objects have\na weak spatial relationship and are therefore not connectedby an edge in the spatial graph. Guo et al. [ 80] de\ufb01ne a graph\nof a similar nature known as a geometry graph. It is de\ufb01ned\nas an undirected graph that encodes relative spatial positions\nbetween objects with an overlap and relative distance thatmeet certain thresholds.\nHierarchical spatial (Tree).\nThese graphs build on from the\nspatial graph but the relationships between nodes focus on\nthe hierarchical nature of the spatial relationship between thedetected objects within an image. Yao et al. [ 87] propose to\nuse a tree (i.e. a graph where each pair of nodes is connected\nby a single path) to de\ufb01ne a hierarchical image representation.\nAn image ( I) is \ufb01rst divided into regions using Faster-RCNN\n[78](R={r\ni}K\ni=1) with each region being further divided\ninto instance segmentations ( M={mi}K\ni=1). This gives\na three-layer tree structure ( T=(I,R,M,Etree), where\nEtreeis the set of connecting edges) to represent the image,\nas shown in Fig. 2f. He et al. [ 60] use a hierarchical spatial\ngraph, with relationships representing \u2018parent\u2019, \u2018child\u2019, and\u2018neighbour\u2019 relationships depending on the intersection overunion of the bounding boxes.\nSimilarity graph. The similarity graph (Fig. 2) proposed by\nKan et al.[ 88] (referred to as a semantic graph by the authors)\nis generated by computing the dot product between twovisual features extracted by Faster-RCNN [ 78]. The dot\nproducts are then used to form the values of an adjacency\nmatrix Aas the operation captures the similarity between\ntwo vectors, the higher the dot product, the closer the twovectors are. Faster-RCNN extracts a set of nvisual features,\nwhere each feature x(v)is associated to a node vand the\nvalue of the edge between two nodes vand uis given by\nA\nu,v=\u03c3/parenleftbig\nx(v)TMx(u)/parenrightbig\n, where \u03c3(\u00b7)is a nonlinear function\nand Mis a learnt weight matrix. The authors of [ 88] suggest\nthat generating the graph this way allows for relationshipsbetween objects to be discovered in a data-driven manner,\nrather than relying on a model trained on a dataset such as\nthe Visual Genome [ 46].\nImage graphs/K-nearest neighbour graph. In their 2021\nimage captioning work, Dong et al. [ 89] construct an image\n123\nH. Senior et al.\ngraph by converting images into a latent feature space by\naveraging the object vectors output by feeding the image intoFaster-RCNN [ 78]. The Kclosest images from the training\ndata or search space in terms of l\n2distance are then turned\ninto an undirected complete graph, shown in Fig. 2h. This is a\nsimilar approach used by Liu et al. [ 90] with their K-nearest\nneighbour graph.\nTopic graph. Proposed by Kan et al. [ 88], the topic graph is\nan undirected graph of nodes representing topics extracted\nby GPU-DMM [ 91]. Topics are latent features representing\nshared knowledge across the entire caption set. Modelling\nthem as a graph, as shown in Fig. 2i, with edges computed by\ntaking the dot product of the two nodes, allows the modellingof knowledge represented in the captions.\nRegion adjacency graph. A region adjacency graph (RAG)\nis a graph made up of nodes representing homogeneous seg-\nments of the image, with edges representing the connection ofadjacent regions. There are different approaches to de\ufb01ning\nthe regions, but patches or superpixels are commonly used.\nPatches, small equal divisions of the image, are used by Suiet al. [ 92] whilst superpixels, an unsupervised segmentation\napproach for clustering nearby pixels, are used by [ 93].\nKnowledge graph. A knowledge graph, or fact graph, is\na graph-based representation of information. Whilst there\nis no agreed structure of these graphs [ 94], they typically\ntake the form of triplets. They are used in a wide variety of\ntasks to provide the information needed to \u2018reason\u2019. Hence,\nknowledge graphs enable the FVQA task.\n3 An overview of graph neural networks\nOver the past years, a large number of GNN architec-\ntures have been introduced in the literature. Wu et al. [ 95]\nproposed a taxonomy containing four distinct groups: recur-rent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, autoencoder GNNs, and\nspatial\u2013temporal GNNs. The applications discussed in this\npaper mostly utilise convolutional GNNs, for a comprehen-sive overview of other architectures readers are directed to[95]. GNNs, especially traditional architectures such as graph\nconvolutional network, have a deep grounding in relational\ninductive biases [ 41]. They are built on the assumption of\nhomophily, i.e. that connected nodes are similar. There is\nan increasing body of work looking into addressing some of\nthe bottlenecks that GNNs may suffer from. Novel trainingstrategies such as [ 96] have been shown to reduce GPU mem-\nory whilst approaches such as [ 97] reduce the difference in\nperformance when dealing with homophilic or heterophilicgraphs.3.1 Graph convolutional networks\nOne common convolutional GNN architecture is the message\npassing neural networks (MPNNs) proposed by Gilmer et al.\nAlthough this architecture has been shown to be limited [ 98],\nit forms a good abstraction of GNNs.\nGilmer et al. describe MPNNs as being comprised of a\nmessage function, update function, and readout function.\nThese functions will vary depending on the application ofthe network, but are learnable, differentiable, and permuta-\ntion invariant. The message and update functions will run\nfor a number of time steps T, passing messages between\nconnected nodes of the graph. These are used to update the\nhidden feature vectors of the nodes, which are then used to\nupdate the node feature vector, which in turn is used in thereadout function.\nThe messages are de\ufb01ned as\nm\n(t+1)\nv=/summationdisplay\nu\u2208N(v)Mt(h(t)\nv,h(t)\nu,ev,u), (1)\nwhere a message for a node at the next time step m(t+1)\nv is\ngiven by combining its current hidden state h(t)\nvwith that\nof its neighbour h(t)\nuand any edge feature ev,uin a multi-\nlayer perceptron (MLP) Mt(\u00b7). Given that a message is an\naggregation of all the connected nodes, the summation acts\nover the nodes connected to the node u\u2208N(v), i.e. the\nneighbourhood of v.\nThese messages are then used to update the hidden vectors\nby combining the node current state with the message in an\nMLP Ut.\nh(t+1)\nv=Ut(ht\nv,m(t+1)\nv) (2)\nOnce the message passing phase has run for Ttime steps,\na readout phase is then conducted using a readout function,\nR(\u00b7). This is de\ufb01ned as an MLP that considers the updated\nfeature vectors of nodes ( hT\nv) on the whole graph ( v\u2208G)t o\nproduce a prediction and is de\ufb01ned as:\n\u02c6y=R({hT\nv|v\u2208G}) (3)\nIn order to make the GCN architecture scale to large\ngraphs, the GraphSAGE [ 99] architecture changes the mes-\nsage function. Rather than taking messages from the entire\nneighbourhood of a node, a random sample is used. Thisreduces the number of messages that require processing,\nresulting in an architecture that works well on large graphs.\n3.2 Gated graph neural networks\nThe core idea behind the gated graph neural network\n(GGNN) [ 100] is to replace the update function from the\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nFig. 2 A visual comparison of the various graph types used across vision-language tasks. Best viewed in colour\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nmessage passing architecture (Eq. 2) with a gated recurrent\nunit (GRU) [ 101]. The GRU is a recurrent neural network\nwith a update and reset gates that controls which data can\n\ufb02ow through the network (and be retained) and which data\ncannot (and therefore be forgotten).\nh(t+1)\nv=GRU\u239b\n\u239dh(t)\nv,/summationdisplay\nu\u2208N(v)Wh(t)\nu\u239e\n\u23a0. (4)\nwhere ht\nvis the hidden feature of node vat time t,Wis a\nlearnt weight matrix, and u\u2208N(v)is the subset of nodes in\nthe graph connected to node v.\nThe GGNN also replaces the message function from Eq. 1\nwith a learnable weight matrix. Using the GRU alongside\nback-propagation through time enables the GGNN to operateon series data. However, due to the recurrent nature of the\narchitecture, it can become unfeasible in terms of memory to\nrun the GGNN on large graphs.\n3.3 Graph attention networks\nFollowing on from the multi-head attention mechanism ofthe popular Transformer architecture [ 40], graph attention\nnetworks (GATs) [ 102] extend the common GCN to include\nthis attention attribute. Using an attention function, typically\nmodelled by an MLP, the architecture calculates an attentionweighting between two nodes. This process is repeated K\ntimes using Kattention heads in parallel. The attention scores\nare then averaged to give the \ufb01nal weights.\nThe self-attention is computed by a function a(h\nt\nv,ht\nu)\n(typically an MLP) that attends to the hidden representation\nof a node ( ht\nv) and one of its neighbours ( ht\nu). Once every node\npairing in the graph has their attention computed, the scoresare passed through a softmax function to give a normalised\nattention coef\ufb01cient ( \u03b1\nv,u). This process is then extended to\nmulti-head attention by repeating the process across Kdiffer-\nent attention heads, each with different initialisation weights.\nThe \ufb01nal node representation is achieved by concatenating or\naveraging (represented as /bardbl)t h e Kattention heads together.\nh(t+1)\nv=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleK\nk=1\u03c3\u239b\n\u239d/summationdisplay\nu\u2208N(v)\u03b1(k)\nv,uW(k)hu\u239e\n\u23a0 (5)\nwhere \u03c3is a nonlinear activation function such as ReLU and\nWis a learnable weight matrix.\n3.4 Graph memory networks\nRecent years have seen the development of graph memory\nnetworks, which can conceptually be thought of as modelswith an internal and external memory. When there are mul-tiple graphs overlapping the same spatial information, as in\n[103], the use of some form of external memory can allow\nfor an aggregation of node updates and the graph undergoes\nmessage passing. This essentially allows for features from\nmultiple graphs to be combined in some way that goes beyonda more simplistic pooling operation. In the case of Khademi[103], two graphs are constructed across the same image but\nmay have different nodes. These graphs are updated using a\nGGNN. An external spatial memory is constructed to aggre-gate information from across the graphs as they are updated,\nusing a neural network with an attention mechanism. The\n\ufb01nal state of the spatial memory is used to perform the \ufb01naltask.\n3.5 Modern graph neural network architectures\nIn recent years, the limits of message passing GNNs havebecome increasingly evident, from their tendency to over-\nsmooth the input features as the depth of the network\nincreases [ 104] to their unsatisfactory performance in het-\nerophilic settings [ 105], i.e. when neighbouring nodes in\nthe input graphs are dissimilar. Furthermore, the expressive\npower of GNNs based on the message passing mechanismhas been shown to be bounded by that of the well-knownWeisfeiler\u2013Lehman isomorphism test [ 98], meaning that\nthere are inherent limits to their ability to generate differ-\nent representations for structurally different input graphs.\nMotivated by the desire to overcome these issues,\nresearchers have now started looking at alternative models\nthat move away from standard message passing architectures.Efforts in this direction include, among many others, higher-\norder message passing architectures [ 106], cell complexes\nnetworks [ 107], networks based on diffusion processes [ 2,\n105,108]. To the best of our knowledge, the application of\nthese architectures to the 2D image understanding tasks dis-\ncussed in this paper has not been explored yet. As such, we\nrefer the readers to the referenced papers for detailed infor-mation on the respective architectures.\n4 Image captioning\nImage captioning is the challenging task of producing a nat-\nural language description of an image. Outside of being\nan interesting technical challenge, it presents an oppor-tunity to develop accessibility technologies for severely\nsight impaired (formally \u2018blind\u2019) and sight impaired users\n(formally \u2018visually impaired\u2019\n2). Additionally, it has appli-\ncations in problems ranging from image indexing [ 109]t o\nsurveillance [ 88]. There are three forms of image captioning\n2The UK Department of Health and Social Care adopted the more\ninclusive phrasing around 2017.\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\ntechniques: 1) retrieval-based captioning, where a caption\nis retrieved from a set of existing captions, 2) template-based captioning, where a pre-existing template is \ufb01lled in\nusing information extracted from the image, and 3) deep\nlearning-based image captioning, where a neural networkis tasked with generating a caption from an input image.We propose to re\ufb01ne this taxonomy to differentiate between\nGNN-based approaches and more traditional deep learning\npowered image captioning. The following section details theGNN-based approaches to image captioning, of which there\nhave been a number of in recent years. Figure 3illustrates the\nstructure of a generic GNN-based image captioning architec-ture.\nGNN-based approaches to image captioning all follow\nthe traditional encoder\u2013decoder-based approach commonin deep learning image captioning techniques. Images \ufb01rstundergo object detection, the output of which is used to create\nan encoding. These encodings are then decoded, traditionally\nwith a long short-term memory network (LSTM), into a cap-tion. Through incorporating GNNs, researchers have been\nable to enhance the encoded image representation by incorpo-\nrating spatial and semantic information into the embeddings.\nAs the task of image captioning has developed over\ntime, so have the evaluation metrics used to assess the\nperformance of proposed architectures. Originally, imagecaptioning relied heavily on machine translation evalua-tion techniques such as BLEU [ 110], ROUGE [ 111], and\nMETEOR [ 112] as no image captioning speci\ufb01c metric\nexisted. However, this changed with the introduction of bothCIDEr [ 113] and SPICE [ 86]. The performance metrics are\ndetailed in Table 2.\nThe \ufb01rst architecture to use a GNN to improve image\ncaptioning was by Yao et al. [ 39]. In their work, they pro-\npose the use of a GCN to improve the feature embeddings\nof objects in an image. They \ufb01rst start by applying a FasterRCNN object detector [ 78] to the image in order to extract\nfeature vectors representing objects. These feature vectors\nare then used to create two graphs: a bidirectional spatial\ngraph encoding spatial relationships between objects and adirected semantic graph which encodes the semantic rela-\ntionships between objects. A GCN is then applied to both\ngraphs before the enhanced features of the graphs undergomean pooling. They are then decoded by an LSTM into a\ncaption. As the whole graphs are used to inform the caption\ngeneration, it may lead to scenarios where dense graphs leadto redundant or low-value information being included in thecaption.\nZhong et al. [ 79] focus solely on a semantic graph and\naddress the problem of which nodes and edges to include inthe \ufb01nal caption. This is challenging for scenes containing a\nlot of detected objects as the semantic graphs can become\nrelatively large. The problem is addressed by decompos-ing the semantic graph into various sub-graphs that covervarious parts of the image. They are then scored using a\nfunction trained to determine how closely the sub-graphresembles the ground truth caption. This enables the selec-\ntion of sub-graphs from the main semantic graph (produced\nby the commonly used MotifNet [ 114]) that will go on to\ngenerate useful captions. Zhong et al. [ 79] make use of a\nGCN to aggregate neighbourhood information of the pro-\nposed sub-graph; focusing on the link between the language\nmodality and semantic graph, therefore discarding the spatialinformation.\nAnother work that makes use of the semantic graph is\nthat of Song et al. [ 115]. They investigated how both implicit\nand explicit features can be utilised to generate accurate and\nhigh-quality image captions. The authors de\ufb01ne implicit fea-\ntures as representing global interactions between objects andexplicit features as those de\ufb01ned on a semantic graph. Forthe latter, rather than using multiple graphs, [ 115] only uses\na single semantic graph. However, rather than predicting the\ngraph directly via MotifNet [ 114]a si no t h e rw o r k s[ 79], its\nconstruction starts with a spatial graph. After object detec-\ntion, a fully connected directed graph is generated between\nthe objects (with nodes being represented by the object fea-ture vector). The edges of this graph are then whittled away\nin a two step process. Firstly, edges between objects that\nhave zero overlap (measured as intersection over union) andanl\n2distance less than the longest side of either objects\nbounding box are removed. The remaining edges are used to\ndetermine which object pairs have their relationship detected\nby MotifNet [ 114]. Those relationships with a high enough\nprobability are kept whilst the others are removed. This\nresults in a semantic graph that indirectly contains spatial\ninformation, going beyond the semantic graph of [ 79]. The\n\ufb01nal graph is then processed by a GGNN, the output of\nwhich is a representation of the explicit features. The implicit\nfeatures are generated by a Transformer encoder [ 40]. The\nentire image alongside the regions within the detected objectbounding boxes is encoded. These features are then used\nalongside those of the explicit features as input to an LSTM\nlanguage decoder that is used to generate the \ufb01nal caption.The work demonstrates the successes possible when using\nGNNs alongside Transformers, using their different induc-\ntive biases to best model different interactions (see Table 3).\nHowever, both the implicit and explicit relationships remain\nlocal to a single image. Further work could consider how\noften certain relationships occur over the entire dataset.\nGuo et al. [ 80] took a very similar approach to Yao et al.\n[39] with their work, utilising a dual graph architecture con-\ntaining a semantic and spatial graph. However, they make the\nobservation that images can be represented by a collectionof visual semantic unit (VSU) vectors, which represent an\nobject, its attributes, and its relationships. These VSUs are\ncombined into a semantic graph that models relationships asnodes rather than edge features and adds attribute nodes con-\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nFig. 3 An abstract overview of GNN-based image captioning architec-\ntures discussed in this section. Most architectures extract image featuresand use them to construct at least one graph to represent the image.Some papers [ 88,89] build higher-level graphs at an image level ratherthan an object level. A GNN is then applied to these graphs, and the\nresulting features are fed into a language generator that creates an appro-priate caption for the image. Traditionally this was an LSTM, but morerecently the trend is to use Transformers [ 40]. Best viewed in colour\nTable 2 A table detailing the different image captioning performance metrics\nMetric Original \ufb01eld Based on Description\nBLEU Machine translation Precision Based on a modi\ufb01ed n-gram precision where the reference word is\nexhausted after a matching candidate word is identi\ufb01ed. BLEUfavours captions that are a similar in length to the referencecaption\nROUGE Machine text summarisation Recall Built with four components: an n-gram recall between the\ncandidate and reference set, a comparison of the longest commonsub-sequence, a comparison of the weighted longest commonsub-sequence, and \ufb01nally, the skip-bigram co-occurrence statistic\nMETEOR Machine translation F\nmean Uses the harmonic mean of the precision and recall between\ncandidate caption and reference captions\nCIDEr Image Captioning n-grams The metric is based on a number of intuitions. Firstly, that if an\nn-gram is not present in the reference captions it should notappear in the candidate caption. Secondly, that it should encodehow often n-grams present in the candidate captions are present.And \ufb01nally, n-grams that occur across all the reference captions\nshould be assigned a lower weighting as they will be things like\narticles and have little to no important information\nSPICE Image Captioning Textual Semantic Tree Reference and candidate captions are converted into textual\nsemantic graphs to compare the semantic makeup of the captions\nnected to objects, thus making it multi-partite. Doing so gives\nthe graph a closer resemblance to the captions it will go on togenerate as objects map to nouns, relationships to verbs and\nprepositions, and \ufb01nally attributes to adjectives. The authors\nargue that this approach allows the model to explicitly learnrelationships and model them directly. As argued in [ 80],\na semantic graph of an image has a close mapping to the\nimage caption. Nodes representing objects map directly to\nnouns, edge features (in the case of [ 39]) or nodes (in the\ncase of [ 80]) that encode relationships map clearly to prepo-\nsitions, and nodes representing attributes map to adjectives.\nThis strong relationship between the graph structure gener-ated by the encoder and the \ufb01nal sentence outputted by the\ndecoder further supports the use of the image graph\u2013sentence\narchitecture used by many image captioning systems.Zhou et al. [ 81] use an LSTM alongside a Faster-RCNN\n[78]-based image feature extractor, with the addition of a\nvisual self-attention mechanism. The authors make use of\na multi-partite semantic graph, following the style of [ 38,\n80]. Speci\ufb01cally, they propose to use three GCNs to cre-\nate context-aware feature vectors for each of the object,attribute, and relationship nodes. The resulting context-aware\nnodes undergo fusion with the self-attention maps, enabling\nthe model to control the granularity of captions. Finally,the authors test two methods of training an LSTM-based\nlanguage generator: the \ufb01rst being a traditional supervised\napproach with cross-entropy loss and the second being a rein-forcement learning-based approach that uses CIDEr [ 113]a s\nthe reward function. By utilising context dependent GCNs\nin their architecture, to speci\ufb01cally account for the object,attribute, and relationship nodes, SASG is able to achieve\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\ncompetitive results when compared with similar models, as\nshown in Table 3.\nSGAE (scene graph autoencoder) is another paper to make\nuse of a multi-partite semantic graph. In the paper, Yang et\nal. [58] take a caption and convert it into a multi-partite tex-\ntual semantic graph using a similar process to that of theSPICE metric [ 86] (detailed further in Table 2). The nodes of\nthe graph are converted to word embeddings which are then\nconverted into feature embeddings by way of a GCN, witheach node type being given its own GCN with independent\nparameters. These feature embeddings are then combined\nwith a dictionary to enable them to be re-encoded before theyare used to generate a sentence. The dictionary weights are\nupdated via back-propagating the cross-entropy loss from the\nsentence regeneration. By including a dictionary, the authorsare able to learn inductive biases from the captions. Thisallows generated captions to go from \u2018man on motorcycle\u2019\nto \u2018man riding motorcycle\u2019. When given an image, SGAE\ngenerates a multi-partite visual semantic graph, similar to[38,80], using Faster-RCNN [ 78] and MotifNet [ 114]. These\nvisual features are then combined with their word embed-\ndings through a multi-modal GCN and then re-encoded usingthe previously learnt dictionary. These features are then used\nto generate the \ufb01nal sentence.\nYang et al. [ 116] take a multi-partite semantic graph and\ninput it to a multi-head attention-based GNN. The MHA-GNN is based on the Transformer architecture in that a\nmulti-head self-attention is computed between all the nodes\nof the graph. However, the output of the self-attention ismasked by an adjacency matrix prior to the softmax. Doing so\nenables a self-attention mechanism that maintains the origi-\nnal semantic graph structure. Additionally, the model makesuse of Mixture of Experts (MoE) decoding, a \ufb01rst for image\ncaptioning. Each node type (object, relationship, attribute)\ngets its own decoder, and the output is put through a softrouter which computes the \ufb01nal output token.\nRather than utilising multiple graphs, Wang et al. [ 117]\ninstead use a single fully connected spatial graph with an\nattention mechanism to learn the relationships between dif-ferent regions. This graph is formed of nodes that represent\nthe spatial information of regions within the image. Once\nformed, it is passed through a GGNN [ 100] to learn the\nweights associated with the edges. Once learnt, these edge\nweights correspond to the probability of a relationship exist-\ning between the two nodes.\nThe work of Yao et al. [ 87], following on from their GCN-\nLSTM [ 39], presents an image encoder that makes use of\na novel hierarchy parsing (HIP) architecture. Rather than\nencoding the image in a traditional scene graph structurelike most contemporary image captioning papers [ 39,79,\n89], Yao et al. [ 87] take the novel approach of using a tree\nstructure (discussed in Sect. 2.3), exploiting the hierarchi-\ncal nature of objects in images. Unlike their previous workwhich focused on the semantic and spatial relationships, this\nwork is about the hierarchical structure within an image. Thishierarchical relationship can be viewed as a combination of\nboth semantic and spatial information\u2014therefore merging\nthe two graphs used previously. The feature vectors repre-senting the vertices on the tree are then improved through theuse of Tree-LSTM [ 118]. As trees are a special case graph,\nthe authors also demonstrate that their previous work GCN-\nLSTM [ 39] can be used to create enriched embeddings from\nthe tree before decoding it with an LSTM. They demonstrate\nthat the inclusion of the hierarchy passing improves scores\non all benchmarks when compared with GCN-LSTM [ 39],\nwhich does not use hierarchical relationships.\nT h ew o r ko fH ee ta l .[ 60] build on the idea of a hierarchi-\ncal spatial relationships proposed by Yao et al.[ 87]. However,\nrather than use a tree to represent these relationships, theyuse a graph with three relationship types: parent, neighbour,\nand child. They then propose a modi\ufb01cation to the popular\nTransformer layer to better adapt it to the task of image pro-cessing. After detecting objects using Faster-RCNN [ 78\n], a\nhierarchical spatial relationship graph is constructed. Three\nadjacency matrices are then built from this graph to model thethree relationship types ( /Omega1\np,/Omega1n,and/Omega1c, respectively). The\nauthors modify the Transformer layer so that rather compute\nself-attention across the whole spatial graph, there is a sub-layer for each relationship type. Each sub-layer processes thequery Qwith its own key K\niand value Viwith the modi\ufb01ed\nattention mechanism:\nAttention (Q,Ki,Vi)=/Omega1i\u2299Sof tmax/parenleftBigg\nQKT\ni\u221a\nd/parenrightBigg\nVi(6)\nwhere \u2299is the Hadamard product and irefers to the rela-\ntionship type i\u2208{parent ,neighbour ,child}and is used\nto specify the adjacency matrix ( /Omega1) used. Finally,\u221a\ndis\nused as a regularisation technique with dbeing the dimen-\nsion of Ki. Using the Hadamard product essentially zeroes\nout the attention between regions whose relationship is not\nbeing processed by that sub-layer. The resulting encodingsare decoded by an LSTM to produce captions.\nLike [ 60], the M2 meshed memory Transformer proposed\nby Cornia et al. [ 59] also makes use of the increasingly pop-\nular Transformer architecture [ 40]. Unlike other papers [ 39,\n58,60,87] which make use of some prede\ufb01ned structure\non extracted image features (spatial graph, semantic graph,\netc.), M2 uses stacks of self-attention layers across the set of\nall the image regions. The standard key and values from the\nTransformer are edited to include the concatenation of learn-\nable persistent memory vectors. These allow the architectureto encode a priori knowledge such as \u2018eggs\u2019 and \u2018toast\u2019 make\nup the concept \u2018breakfast\u2019. When decoding the output of the\nencoder, a stack of self-attention layers is also used. Eachdecoder layer is connected via a gated cross-attention mecha-\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nnism to each of the encoder layers, giving way to the \u2018meshed\u2019\nconcept of the paper. The output of the decoder block is usedto generate the \ufb01nal output caption.\nThe work of Herdade et al. [ 119] modi\ufb01es the atten-\ntion weight matrix in order to incorporate relative geometricrelationships between detected objects. These geometricrelationships are de\ufb01ned using a displacement vector that\ncharacterises the difference in geometry between two bound-\ning boxes. The work allows the Transformer-based archi-tecture to incorporate geometric relationships directly into\nthe attention mechanism, a relationship not considered by\nother Transformer-based image captioning techniques suchas [59].\nThe authors of [ 88] propose using a novel similarity\n(referred to as a semantic in the paper) and topic graphs. Builton dot product similarity, the graphs are produced without therequirement of graph extraction models such as MotifNet\n[114]. Rather, a set of vertices V={v\ni\u2208Rdobj}nobj\ni=1are\nextracted as ResNet features from a Faster-RCNN objectdetector [ 78]. Edges in the adjacency matrix are then pop-\nulated using the dot product between the feature vectors in\nVwith a\nij=\u03c3(vT\niMvj), where Mis a matrix of learn-\nable weights and \u03c3is a nonlinear activation function. Once\nboth graphs have been constructed, a GCN is applied to both\nin order to enrich the nodes with local context. A graphself-attention mechanism is then applied to ensure nodesare not just accounting for their immediate neighbours. The\nimproved graphs are then decoded via an LSTM to generate\ncaptions.\nFollowing [ 39], Dong et al. [ 89] use a spatial graph to\nshow a directed relationship between detected objects within\nthe input image. Locally, object features are extracted by aCNN to associate a vector to each vertex of the spatial graph.\nThis process is completed for each image in the dataset. In\naddition to this graph, the authors introduce an image-levelgraph. Speci\ufb01cally, each image is represented by a featurevector that is the average of its associated set of object fea-\nture vectors. The image graph for a corresponding image\nis formed as a fully connected undirected graph of the K\nimages whose l\n2distance is the closest to the input image.\nBoth the local spatial graph and the more global image-level\ngraph are processed by GCNs to create richer embeddingsthat can be used for caption generation. This approach is\nshown to work extremely well, with Dual-GCN achieving\noutperforming comparable models in the BLEU, METEOR,and ROGUE metrics (see Table 3).\n5 Visual question answering\nVQA is the challenging task of designing and implementing\nmodels that are able to answer natural language questionsabout a given image. These answers can range from sim-ple yes/no to more natural, longer form answers. Questions\ncan also vary in complexity. As the \ufb01eld has developed,more speci\ufb01c VQA tasks have emerged. The \ufb01rst to emerge\nwas FVQA, sometimes known as knowledge visual ques-\ntion answering (KVQA), where external knowledge sourcesare required to answer the questions. Another task that hasemerged is Textual VQA, where the models must understand\nthe text within the scene in order to generate answers. All\nthree tasks have their own datasets [ 46,49,50,52,53] and\nhave an active community developing solutions [ 49,84,103].\n5.1 VQA\nOriginally proposed in [ 49], VQA has developed beyond sim-\nple \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 answers to richer natural language answers.\nA common thread of work is to leverage the multi-modalaspect of VQA and utilise both visual features from the input\nimage and textual features from the question [ 84,85,103].\nOne of the \ufb01rst works in VQA to make use of GNNs was\nthat of Teney et al. [ 84]. Their work is based on the clip art\nfocused dataset [ 49]. Their model takes a visual scene graph\nas input alongside a question. The question is then parsed intoa textual scene graph using the Stanford Dependency Parser[83]. These scene graphs are then processed independently\nusing a GGNN [ 100] modi\ufb01ed to incorporate an attention\nmechanism. The original feature vectors are then combinedusing an attention mechanism that re\ufb02ects how relevant two\nnodes from the scene graphs are to one another.\nKhademi [ 103] takes a multi-modal approach to VQA by\nusing dense region captions alongside extracted visual fea-\ntures. Given a query and input image, the model will \ufb01rst\nextract visual regions using a Faster-RCNN object detectorand generated a set of features using ResNet and encodingthe bounding box information into these features. An off-the-\nshelf dense region captioning model is also used to create a set\nof captions and associated bounding boxes. The captions andbounding box information are encoded using a GRU. Each set\nof features is turned into a graph (visual and textual, respec-\ntively) with outgoing and incoming edges existing betweenfeatures if the Euclidean distance between the centre of the\nnormalised bounding boxes is less than \u03b3=0.5. Both graphs\nare processed by a GGNN with updated features being used toupdate an external spatial memory unit\u2014thus making the net-work a graph memory network (described in Sect. 3.4). After\npropagating the node features, the \ufb01nal state of the exter-\nnal spatial memory network is turned into a complete graphusing each location as a node. This \ufb01nal graph is processed\nby a GGNN to produce the \ufb01nal answer. The multi-modal\napproach presented in this paper is shown to be highly effec-tive when compared to similar VQA methods. This approach\nis shown to work extremely well in benchmarks, with the pro-\nposed MN-GMN architecture [ 103] performing favourably\nwith comparable models (Table 4).\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nTable 3 A table showing the model details and various benchmark results of selected image captioning models trained on the COCO [ 47] dataset using the Karpathy split [ 57]\nModel Graph Types Architecture(s) Language Generator BLEU-1 BLEU-4 METEOR ROGUE CIDEr SPICE\nARL [ 117] Spatial GGNN LSTM 75.9 35.8 27.8 56.4 111.3 \u2013\nHIP [ 87] Hierarchical Spatial (Tree) GCN LSTM \u2013 39.1 28.9 59.2 130.6 22.3\nImage Transformer [ 60] Hierarchical Spatial Transformer LSTM 80.8 39.5 29.1 59.0 130.8 22.8\nDual-GCN [ 89] Spatial, Image (Dual) GCN Transformer 82.2 39.7 29.7 59.7 129.2 \u2013\nSUB-GC [ 79] Semantic GCN LSTM 76.8 36.2 27.7 56.6 115.3 20.7\nSASG [ 81] Birpartite Semantic GCN LSTM 81.8 38.9 29.2 59.4 128.9 25.0\nGCN-LSTM [ 39] Spatial, Semantic GCN LSTM 80.9 38.3 28.6 58.5 128.7 22.1\nEIVRN [ 115] Spatial, Semantic GGNN Transformer \u2013 39.4 29.3 59.1 131.9 22.8\nVSUA [ 80] Multi-partite Semantic, Spatial GCN LSTM \u2013 38.4 28.5 58.4 128.6 22.0\nSGAE [ 58] Multi-partite Textual, Multi-partite Semantic GCN, multi-modal GNN LSTM 80.8 38.4 28.4 58.6 127.8 22.1\nTFSGC [ 116] Multi-partite Semantic GCN MoE Transformer \u2013 39.92 9 .8 59.4 133.0 23.4\nTopic [ 88] Similarity GCN LSTM \u2013 39.2 29.1 59.0 129.5 22.6\nM2[59] \u2013 Transformer Transformer 80.8 39.1 29.2 58.6 131.2 22.6\nObject Relation Transformer [ 119] \u2013 Transformer Transformer 80.5 38.6 28.6 58.4 128.3 22.6\nBold: Best score\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nMORN [ 85] is another work that focuses on capturing the\ncomplex multi-modal relationships between the question andimage. Like many recent works in deep learning, it adopts\nthe Transformer [ 40] architecture. Built with three main com-\nponents, the model \ufb01rst creates a visual graph of the imagestarting from a fully connected graph of detected objects anda GCN is used to aggregate the visual features. The second\npart of the model creates a textual scene graph from the input\nquestion. Both graphs are merged together by the \ufb01nal com-ponent of the model, a relational multi-modal Transformer,\nwhich is used to align the representations.\nSharma et al. [ 120] follow the Vision-Language multi-\nmodal approach but diverge from the use of a textual semantic\ngraph and instead opt to use word embeddings. The authors\nutilise a novel GGNN-based architecture that processes anundirected complete graph of nodes representing visualfeatures. Nodes are weighted with the probability that a rela-\ntionship occurs between them. In line with other VQA work\n[103], the question is capped to 14 words, with each one being\nconverted into GloVe embeddings [ 121]. Questions with\nfewer than 14 words are padded with zero vectors. A question\nembedding is then generated using a GRU applied to the wordembeddings. An LSTM-based attention mechanism consid-\ners both the question vector and the visual representations\nmaking up the nodes of the scene graph. This module con-siders previously attended areas when exploring new visualfeatures. Finally, an LSTM-based language generator is used\nto generate the \ufb01nal answer. Another work to forgo using a\ntextual scene graph, Zhang et al. [ 55] make use of word vec-\ntors to embed information about the image into a semantic\ngraph. Using a GNN, they are able to create enriched feature\nvectors representing the nodes, edges, and an image featurevector representing the global state. They include the ques-\ntion into the image feature by averaging the word vectors,\nwhich enables the GNN to reason about the image. Whilstboth [ 120] and [ 55] yield good results, by only using word-\nor sentence-level embeddings and not using a textual scene\ngraph, they fail to model relationships in the textual domain.\nThis therefore removes the ability for the models to reasonin that domain alone.\nBoth Li et al. [ 122] and Nuthalapati et al. [ 123]t a k ea\ndifferent route to the established multi-modal approach andinstead use different forms of visual information. Li et al.\n[122] take inspiration from [ 39] and make use of both seman-\ntic and spatial graphs to represent the image. In addition tothese explicit graphs, they also introduce an implicit graph,i.e. a fully connected graph between the detected objects\nwith edge weights set by a GAT. The relation-aware visual\nfeatures are then combined with the question vector usingmulti-modal fusion. The fused output is then used to predict\nan answer via an MLP.\nNuthalapati et al. [ 123] use a dual scene graph approach,\nusing both visual and semantic graphs. These graphs aremerged into a single graph embedding using a novel GAT\narchitecture [ 102] that is able to attend to edges as well as\nnodes. The graphs are enriched with negative entities that\nappear in the question but not the graph. Pruning then takes\nplace to remove nodes and edges that are Khops away from\nfeatures mentioned in the question. A decoder is then usedto produce an answer to the inputted question.\n5.2 Knowledge-/fact-based VQA\nKnowledge- or fact-based VQA is the challenging task ofmaking use of external knowledge given in knowledge graphssuch as WikiData [ 70] to answer questions about an image.\nThe major challenge of this task is to create a model that can\nmake use of all three mediums (image, question, and fact) to\ngenerate an appropriate answer. The MUCKO [ 124] archi-\ntectural diagram shown in Fig. 4(reused with permission), is\nshown as a representative example of models that approach\nFVQA.\nIn [125], the authors present a novel GCN-based archi-\ntecture for FVQA. Alongside the question and answer\nsets, a knowledge base of facts is also included, KB=\n{f\n1,f2,..., f|KB|}. Each fact f=(x,r,y)is formed of a\nvisual concept grounded in the image ( x), an attribute or\nphrase ( y), and a relation linking the two r. Relationships\nexist in a prede\ufb01ned set of 13 different ways a concept andattribute can be related. Their work \ufb01rst reduces the search\nspace to the 100 facts most likely to contain the correct\nanswer by using GloVe embeddings [ 121] of words in the\nquestion and facts before further reducing it to the most rel-\nevant facts f\nrel. These most relevant facts are turned into a\ngraph where all the visual concepts and attributes from frel\nform the nodes. An edge joins two nodes if they are related\nby a fact in frel. A GCN is then used to \u2018reason\u2019 over the\ngraph to predict the \ufb01nal answer. Using a message passing\narchitecture, the authors are able to update the feature repre-sentations of the nodes which can then be fed into an MLP\nwhich predicts a binary label corresponding to whether or\nnot the entity contains the answer.\nZhu et al. [ 124] use a multi-modal graph approach to repre-\nsenting images with a visual, semantic, and knowledge graph.\nAfter graph construction, GCNs are applied to each modalityto create richer feature embeddings. These embeddings arethen processed in a cross-modal manner. Visual\u2013fact aggre-\ngation and semantic\u2013fact aggregation operations produce\ncomplimentary information which is then used with a fact\u2013fact convolutional layer. This \ufb01nal layer takes into account\nall three modalities and produces an answer that considers\nthe global context. The authors continue their work in [ 77]\nby changing the cross-modal mechanism for a novel GRUC\n(Graph-based Read, Update, and Control) mechanism. The\nGRUC operates in a parallel pipeline. One pipeline starts witha concept from the knowledge graph and recurrently incor-\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nTable 4 A table showing the model details and VQA [ 49] Test-Dev results of selected VQA models\nModel Graphs Used Architecture Overall Y/N Number Other Test-Std\nSharma et al [ 120] Semantic GGNN 67.96 84.12 46.12 58.13 67.98\nGraphVQA [ 84] (Abstract Scenes only) Visual and Textual Semantic GCN 70.42 81.26 76.47 56.28 \u2013\nMORN [ 85] Visual and Textual Semantic GCN 71.21 87.15 55.22 61.19 71.53\nMN-GMN [ 103] Visual and Textual Semantic Graph Memory Network 73.28 8 .2 56 64.27 3 .5\nReGAT [ 122] Semantic, Spatial GAT 70.27 86.08 54.42 60.33 70.59\nBold: Best score\nFig. 4 MUCKO architecture [ 124] (reused with permission).

At the end of the recurrent operations, theoutputs of the two pipelines are fused together with the ques-tion and original fact node. This fused feature is then used to\npredict the \ufb01nal answer. The change made to the cross-modal\nattention mechanism yields signi\ufb01cant improvements in theFVQA benchmark when compared with MUCKO [ 124].\nLiu et al. [ 126] also adopt a multi-modal approach, but use\nonly the semantic and knowledge modalities. They proposea dual process system for FVQA that is based on the dual\nprocess theory from cognitive science [ 127]. Their approach\nutilises a BERT encoder to represent the input question anda Faster-RCNN [ 78]-based feature extractor to represent the\nimage features. The \ufb01rst of the two systems, based on the\nTransformer architecture [ 40], joins these two representa-\ntions into a single multi-modal representation. The secondsystem then develops a semantic graph by turning dense\nregion captions into textual scene graphs (using SPICE), as\nwell as a knowledge graph generated using the question input.A message passing GNN is then used to identify the impor-\ntant nodes and aggregate information between them using an\nattention weighting. A joint representation for each knowl-edge graph node is then learned by combining the wholesemantic graph with the node with relation to an attentionweighting. This joint representation is then used to predict\nthe \ufb01nal answer.\nThe GNN-VQA proposed in [ 128] makes use of a\nbidirectional GNN that fuses structured and unstructuredmulti-modal data through a \u2018supernode\u2019. After extracting a\nsemantic graph, they use a pretrained sentence BERT model\nto calculate the similarity between the potential answers andthe Visual Genome region descriptions. The top-10 region\ndescriptions in terms of similarity are averaged and used to\nde\ufb01ne a concept node which is connected to each visual nodeof the semantic graph. Concepts are then extracted from the\nConceptNet KG [ 67] using the labels of detected objects in\nthe image and concepts extracted from potential answers. AGAT-based GNN is then used to construct better node repre-sentations which are then used to select the correct answer.\nMoving away from the multi-modal approach, SGEITL\n[129] makes a semantic graph of the image and then fol-\nlows Yang et al. [ 54] and introduces skip edges to the graph,\nessentially making it a complete graph. This graph then goes\nthrough a multi-hop graph Transformer, which masks theattention between nodes based on their distance, ensuring\nthat only close by nodes are attended to. Through their work,\nthey demonstrate that structural information is useful whenapproaching the complex VQA task.\nWith their TRiG model, Gao et al. [ 130] advocate taking\nan alternative approach to FVQA and rather than generat-\n123\nH. Senior et al.\ning the answer in some multi-modal space, they propose to\nuse the textual space. They argue that this prevents furtherfusion with additional outside knowledge, and that as most\nof this data are in textual form, it makes sense to work in that\ndomain. TRiG therefore has three components. It \ufb01rst con-verts the image into a caption using an off-the-shelf imagecaptioning tool. The model then \ufb01nds the top Krelevant\nfacts from a knowledge base of Wikipedia articles before\nusing a T5 backbone Transformer [ 131] to fuse and decode\nthe<question, visual context, knowledge >triplet into an\nanswer.\n5.3 TextVQA\nTextVQA is the sub-task of VQA where the answers require\nthe model to be able to read text that appears in images.Typically this involves tasks like reading brand names from\nbuildings or the title of book covers. This information can\nthen be combined with an external knowledge base, enablingthe models to answer questions such as \u2018Is the shop an Amer-\nican brand?\u2019 by reading the shop name and searching it in a\nknowledge base.\nGao et al. [ 132] focus on the in-image text and how it can\nbe better leveraged to improve VQA. They use a novel multi-\nmodal graph made up of fully connected visual, semantic,\nand numeric sub-graphs. Each sub-graph represents a uniquemodality that can be found in an image: visual entities (rep-\nresented by image feature extractors), semantic meaning of\ndiscovered text (initially discovered by OCR), along withnumeric values and their semantic meaning. The paper pro-\nposed a model that aggregates information across modalities\ntogether using a relevance score. Once the three modalitieshave been aggregated, an attention mechanism is deployed tohelp predict the \ufb01nal answer. The focus on different modal-\nities proves a useful approach, with the model performing\nfavourably in benchmarks (see Table 6).\nAnother work that makes use of multi-modal graphs is\nLiang et al. [ 133]. Their work uses both image features and\nscene text features (extracted by OCR) to generate a spa-tial relationship graph similar to that of [ 39]. The graph\nundergoes multi-head attention before being processed by\na GNN that makes use of the attention weights. Multi-modalfusion is then used to join the node features with the questionembedding and positional features. The output of this fusion\noperation is then used to predict a \ufb01nal answer.\n6 Image retrieval\nImage retrieval is the task of \ufb01nding images from a databasegiven some query. These queries can take many forms,\nincluding a similar image, a natural language query, or evena sketch. A common approach is to represent the databaseimages as being in some space, where similar images are\nthose with a minimal distance to the query. When this space isrepresented using graphs, GNNs become valuable for sharing\nfeatures and acquiring more global context for the features.\nJohnson et al. [ 38] show that a scene graph can be used\nas the input of the image retrieval system. By allowing endusers to create a scene graph where nodes represent objects,\nattributes, and relationships, they are able to return appropri-\nate images via a scene graph grounding process. This involvesmatching each scene graph object node with a bounding box\npredicted by an object detector, and is represented prob-\nabilistically using a conditional random \ufb01eld (CRF). Theadvantage of using scene graphs as search queries over nat-\nural language is that they scale well in terms of complexity.\nOnce a basic scene graph has been constructed, it is straight-forward for it to be extended and made more complex byadding additional nodes. Another advantage is that it reduces\nthe operations required to map the search query to the image.\nFollowing on from [ 38], Yoon et al. propose IRSGS\n(Image Retrieval with Scene Graph Similarity) [ 73], which\nmakes use of a semantic graph. Given a query image, the\nmodel will generate a semantic graph and compare its sim-ilarity with graphs of images in the database. This graph\ncomparison is achieved by taking the inner product of graph\nembeddings generated by a GNN (either GCN [ 134]o r\nGIN[ 135]). One key contribution of the paper is the concept\nof Surrogate Relevance, which is the similarity between the\ncaptions of the images being compared. Surrogate Relevance\nis calculated using the inner product between Sentence-BERT embeddings of the captions. This measure is used as\nthe training signal of the model to hone the feature embed-\ndings generated by the GNN. The graph-to-graph comparisonbehind the model allows this work to better scale to large\nimage databases when compared to [ 38]. The use of Surro-\ngate Relevance allows the work to be potentially expandedto match against user queries if they are in the style of thecaptions used to power the relevance measure.\nUsing an image graph of K-nearest neighbour graph of\nimages represented as feature embeddings, Liu et al. [ 90]\npropose using a GCN alongside a novel loss function based\non image similarity. The feature embeddings are enhanced to\naccount for a global context across the whole image databaseusing a GCN. Similarity between images is calculated by tak-\ning the inner product of the feature embeddings. The higher\nthe similarity, the better the retrieval candidate. The author\u2019snovel loss function is designed to move similar images closertogether in the embedding space and dissimilar images fur-\nther apart. Compared with [ 73], by using the inner product,\nthe similarity measure is far more deterministic. However,unlike [ 73], it cannot be expanded to work alongside text-\nbased image retrieval with a user query.\nZhang et al.

A GNN is applied to aggregate features\ncreated from a modi\ufb01ed adjacency matrix. Using a GNNallows the re-ranking process to de-emphasise nodes with a\nlow con\ufb01dence score.\nRather than use a pure K-nearest neighbour graph, the\nDGCQ model [ 137] is based on vector quantisation, a pro-\ncess from Information Theory for reducing the cardinality of\na vector space. It can essentially be thought of as a many-to-one clustering technique where vectors in one space x\u2208R\nd\nare mapped to a single point in another space. A mapping\nfunction q(x)maps the vector to a codeword ci. These code-\nwords make up a set of length Kknown as a code book;\nthus, q(x)\u2208C={ci;i\u2208{0...(K\u22121)}}. The learned code\nwords are combined with image features to form landmark\ngraph\u2014based on the similarity graph except the graph alsohas nodes learned through the quantisation process. Once\nthe landmark graph has been constructed, a GCN is use\nto propagate features with the objective of moving similarimages closer together in the feature space. The use of vector\nquantisation allows for the landmark graph to exist in a lower-\ndimensional space, reducing computation when computingwhich images from the graph to return as candidates.\nThe authors of [ 74] move to adopt a multi-modal approach.\nThey use GraphSAGE [ 99] to effectively learn multi-modal\nnode embeddings containing visual and conceptual informa-tion from the connections in the graph. The distance between\nconnected nodes are reduced, whilst the distance between\ndisconnected nodes is increased. By using graph nodes thatrepresent images as well as nodes representing meta-data\ntags, their model is able to provide content-based image\nretrieval as well as tag prediction. At inference time, imagesshown to the model can be attached to the graph through their\nKnearest images, attached to relevant tags, or both. Unlike\nprevious works [ 38,73,90], Misraa et al. [ 74] make use of\nmulti-modal embeddings in the graph nodes.Schuster et al. [ 82] continue the work of Johnson et al.\n[38], by creating a natural language parser that converts a\nquery into a scene graph that can be processed by their work.\nThis allows them to go beyond content-based image retrieval\nand move into text-based image retrieval. Their parser worksby creating a dependency tree using the Stanford Depen-\ndency Parser [ 83] and then modifying the tree. They \ufb01rst\nexecute a quanti\ufb01cation modi\ufb01er that ensures nouns are thehead of the phrase. This is followed by pronoun resolution\nto make the relationship between two objects more explicit.\nFinally, plural nouns are processed. This involves copyingnoun instances when numeric modi\ufb01ers are given. This tex-tual scene graph is then mapped to images following [ 38].\nCui et al. [ 72] also tackle text-based image retrieval. They\npresent work that makes use of a GCN to provide cross-modalreasoning on visual and textual information. Input features\nare split into channels which form a complete graph and\nundergo graph convolution. Once the textual and visual fea-tures are projected into a common space, they have their\ndistances measured using the cosine similarity. These sim-\nilarity scores are then stored in a matrix representing thesimilarities between visual and textual inputs.\nZhang et al. [ 138] tackle the challenging task of Com-\nposing Text and Image to Image Retrieval, where given a\nreference image and modi\ufb01cation query the image retrievalsystem must \ufb01nd an image similar to the reference that con-\ntains the modi\ufb01cations outlined in the query. The principle\nchallenge of this emerging task is its cross-modality nature.The authors tackle this challenge by \ufb01rst generating a spatial\ngraph of the reference image and a textual feature of the mod-\ni\ufb01cation query. These features are then concatenated beforethe graph is processed by a GAT whose attention mechanismhas been altered to account for the directionality of the graph\nand the spatial data it encodes. A collection of GRUs that\nform a Global Semantic Reasoning GSR unit are then used\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nto create the \ufb01nal embedding for the reference image. The\nsame process is used on the target image but without the con-catenation of the textual feature. A cross-modal loss function\nand adversarial loss function are combined to ensure that the\nfeatures outputted by the Global Semantic Reasoning unit ofthe same category are moved closer together.\nChaudhuri et al. [ 93] adopt a Siamese-based network\narchitecture where two similar inputs go into two sepa-\nrate networks that share weights. This network architecturetypically uses contrastive loss or triplet loss to ensure the out-\nputs of these networks are similar. The authors use a novel\nSiamese-GCN on a region adjacency graph that is formedby connecting adjacent segmented regions and weighting the\nedge accounting for the distance and angle between centroids\nof the regions. They apply their technique to high-resolutionremote sensing images for content-based image retrieval.By using a Siamese-GCN with contrastive loss, the authors\nare able to learn an embedding that brings similar images\ntogether and forces dissimilar images apart. This work isthen followed up by the authors in [ 139], where they add a\nrange of attention mechanisms. They implement both node-\nlevel and edge-level attention mechanisms (in a similar styleto GAT [ 102]). These attention mechanisms are then incor-\nporated into the Siamese-GCN to yield improvements over\ntheir previous work.\nAnother work to incorporate a Siamese network design\nwas Zhang et al. [ 140]. They use a three part network design\nto perform zero-shot sketch-based image retrieval with a\nSiamese-based encoding network which creates features ofthe image and associated sketch using ResNet50. These fea-\ntures are the concatenated together to create node features.\nThe similarity between nodes is calculated using a metricfunction modelled by an MLP, and this operation is used to\npopulate the adjacency matrix of a similarity graph. A GCN\nis then applied to the similarity graph to create fusion embed-dings of sketch\u2013image pairs. Rather than use an MLP toreconstruct the semantic information from the GCN embed-\ndings, the authors chose to use a conditional variational\nautoencoder [ 141]. Doing so enables the model to generate\nsemantic information for sketches of unseen classes, aiding\nthe zero-shot component of the model.\n7 Discussion and conclusion\nIn this section, we draw upon the views of Battaglia et al. [ 41],\nand discuss how the popular Transformer [ 40] can be viewed\nthrough the lens of GNNs. We then discuss how its depen-dence on consistent structure may pose challenges should\nimage generation techniques be applied to create new train-\ning data for image captioning. The section concludes with a\ufb01nal summary of the paper and an overview of the challengesand future research directions that lie ahead for graph-based\n2D image understanding.\n7.1 Why GNNs when we have transformers?\nRecent years have seen the rapid rise in popularity of theTransformer architecture [ 40]. Originally proposed in the\nNatural Language Processing domain, it was quickly applied\nas a generalised encoder in computer vision tasks [ 60].\nFurther work then expanded the architecture so that it can\nprocess images directly [ 142,143], allowing it to operate\nas a backbone for common vision tasks. The wide range ofapplications the architecture can be applied to has led to itdominating much of deep learning in recent years.\nThere has been some effort by the community to unify the\nattention-based approach with GNNs. Battaglia et al. [ 41]\nproposes a more generic graph network which both Trans-\nformers and GNNs fall into. They present a viewpoint where\nTransformers can be viewed as a neural architecture operat-ing on a complete graph.\nViewing GNNs and Transformers as graph networks\nshows that they share a number of similarities. Both archi-tectures take a set of values and decide how much differentvalues should be considered when transforming them to\nupdate the values, with GNNs ignoring nodes that are not\nconnected and Transformers scaling the importance of aninput. It is worth noting that if the graph being processed by\na GNN is a complete graph, the graph network will allow\nall nodes to have their messages propagated to one beingupdated. Therefore, it is possible to view the Transformer as\na special case GNN operating on a complete graph. Whilst\nGNNs use the read module to take advantage of an underlyingstructure, the Transformer learns one based on the task.\nBy applying a Transformer to a task, a graph structure\nis being learnt from scratch. Meanwhile, there are plenty\nof graph structures that appear naturally within Vision-Language tasks. This multitude of graph types allow for\ndifferent structures to be taken for the image, from the seman-\ntic structure of an image to the hierarchical structure of theimage with regards to the entire training set. Graphs appear\nnaturally in the language component of the tasks as well, with\nsentence dependency trees being closely aligned to seman-tic graphs (when the semantic graph is made multi-partiteas in the case of [ 80]). When clear graph representations\nof data exist, they should be utilised rather than ignored,\ninstead of learning a graph structure using a more general pur-pose architecture. Utilising existing graph structures enables\na graph network with the appropriate inductive biases to be\ndeployed. It also results in fewer computations as messagesare not being passed between all possible node connections.\nLooking at the results of various image captioning models\n(Table 3), it is clear that whilst the fully Transformer-based\nM2 model performs impressively with a BLEU-4 of 39.1,\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nmodels utilising GNN-based encoders outperform it. For\nexample, the Dual-GCN [ 89] has a BLEU-4 of 39.7. Table 3\nshows that the bene\ufb01ts of a Transformer lie in the language\ngeneration, rather than the image encoding. A GNN-based\nencoder seems to create a better representation of the image.This viewpoint is reinforced by the performance of [ 119].\nWhilst their incorporation of geometric relationships into the\nTransformer attention model works well, it falls short of the\nperformance of models that speci\ufb01cally use a spatial graph[87,89,115]. These results show that if a speci\ufb01c relation-\nship, one that can be expressed explicitly as a graph, is being\nexploited by a model, then its architecture should make useof a GNN to take advantage of the graph. The spatial relation-\nships between objects form a graph, and therefore, a GNN is\nwell suited to make use of this information.\nAlthough Transformers can be viewed as operating on a\ncomplete graph and pruning edges via the attention mecha-\nnism [ 41], we have demonstrated in this survey that this is\nnot always the best approach. This raises the questions of 1)which graph should be used? and 2) How do we construct\nbetter graphs?\nThere are a wide number of aspects that researchers should\nconsider when selecting a graph type for a GNN-based\nVision-Language model. However, they all come down to\nexperimentation and iteration during development. WhilstGCN-LSTM and VSUA demonstrate that a semantic graphis better suited to image captioning than a spatial graph, that\nis not to say spatial graphs no longer have a place in image\ncaptioning. It may be pertinent to incorporate a spatial graphif a model spatial reasoning is limited.\nWhilst the challenge of producing better graphs is some-\ntimes down to the optimisation of hyperparameters (in thecase of the kNN-based image graph), better graphs are\nsometimes data or model dependent. Larger, more detailed\nknowledge graphs will yield improvements in fVQA andimprovements in scene graph generation will produce richersemantic graphs. Scene graph generation is an incredibly\nvibrant \ufb01eld within Vision-Language and we direct readers\nto relevant surveys [ 144]. Better graph representations can\nbe achieved through careful de\ufb01nition of the graph struc-\nture. Spatial relationships have been modelled in a number\nof different ways [ 39,80,119], leading to different model\nperformance. Finally, developments in upstream tasks such\nas object detection can lead to better initial representation\nof visual components in the nodes of graphs. Advancementslike VinVL [ 145] show that the use of more contemporary\nobject detection techniques produces richer features that can\nbe incorporated into the graphs used in Vision-Language\ntasks.\nWhen it is possible to utilise multiple graphs, it is advan-\ntageous to do so when compared to using a single graph. As\nshown with image captioning (Table 3), architectures that\nonly use a single graph type perform sub-optimally com-pared to their multi-graph counterparts. ARL [ 117], SUB-GC\n[79], and Topic [ 88] all use a single graph (spatial, semantic,\nand similarity, respectively) and all three suffer in bench-\nmarks. Whilst Topic performs well in BLEU, METEOR, and\nROGUE, when evaluated using metrics designed speci\ufb01callyfor image captioning (SPICE and CIDEr) its performance fal-ters against comparable models. This theme of multi-graph\napproaches performing more favourably is also found across\nthe VQA, FVQA, and TextVQA tasks, with multi-graphapproaches outperforming their single graph counterparts.\n7.2 Latent diffusion and the future of image\ncaptioning\nCurrently, image captioning techniques are constrained by\ntheir training data. As popular as COCO is within the Com-puter Vision community for its wide ranging scenes and\ngeneralisability to the real world, it has its shortcomings.\nCaptioning systems trained on it alone will never understandparticular art styles, or objects outside of the 80 cate-\ngories covered by the COCO dataset. The advent of image\ngeneration techniques such as DALLE \u00b73[146] present an\nopportunity for image captioning systems to go well beyondan 80 category limit and start understanding various stylistic\nelements of images. Work in this area is in its infancy [ 147,\n148], but previous non-generative unsupervised approaches\nto image captioning are very promising [ 29].\nWe speculate that latent diffusion-based captioning may\nbe a promising avenue of research. However, for thisapproach to work effectively, image generation techniques\nwill need to develop further. Currently Stable Diffusion 2.1\n[149] and similar systems do not understand structure as\ndeeply as would be required for them to be able to replacethe training data of a captioning system, although DALLE \u00b73\n[146] has shown improvements in this area. As impressive as\nthey are, diffusion models can struggle to assemble imagescorrectly when the prompt asks for something that is unlikely\nin real life. When asked to generate an image of \u2018a man\ngiving a horse a piggyback ride\u2019, models such as DALLE \u00b72\n[150] and Stable Diffusion 2.1 [ 149] can sometimes strug-\ngle to understand the requested spatial relation between the\ntwo objects, resulting in the sample result shown in Fig. 5.\nAlthough DALLE \u00b73[146] produces an image that aligns to\nthe basic prompt, when changing \u2018man\u2019 to \u2018woman\u2019, the pro-\nduced image no longer matches the prompt as intended. It\ncould be argued that so called \u2018prompt hacking\u2019 could coerceall the models to produce the desired relationship between\nthe objects when said relationship is outside of common dis-\ntributions. However, that argument fails to address the factthat these models fail to understand a relationship a toddler\nwould understand.\nDiscovering examples of incorrect relationships in images\nis not just a case of dreaming up relationships between objects\n123\nH. Senior et al.\nFig. 5 A comparison of\ndifferent text-to-image models\nwhen given a simplistic caption.\nBest viewed in colour\nthat are unlikely to exist in training data. Conwell and Ullman\n[151] conducted a participant study where they asked 169\npeople to select generated images that they felt well matched\na given prompt. They found that across the generated images\nin their study, only 22% matched the original prompt. Theauthors conclude that \u2018current image generation models do\nnot yet have a grasp of even basic relations involving simple\nobjects and agents\u2019 [151]. Whilst latent diffusion methods\nmay play a role in the future of image captioning, they have a\nlong way to go understanding structure before this is possible.\nIn order for graph networks [ 41] to be applicable to diffusion\ngenerated training data, the structure within the image and thecaption/prompt will need to be consistent. Supervised learn-\ning approaches require large amounts of very clean training\ndata in order to work well, so graph networks [ 41] may strug-\ngle if the underlying structure in the image data is not as\nexpected. However, we still expect that diffusion models will\nplay a role within Vision-Language tasks going forward. Therecent De-Diffusion Model [ 152] shows that the use of an\nimage captioning model as the encoder portion of an autoen-coder enables tasks such as VQA to be achieved by using a\nLarge Language Model on the caption. This use of text as thelatent representation of an image may provide a promising\navenue of research.\n7.3 Final notes\nVision-Language tasks such as image captioning and VQA\npose signi\ufb01cant opportunities for accessibility technologyto be developed for those with sight impairment or severesight impairment. Having widespread automatic alt-text gen-\neration on websites and applications enabling queries about\nimages shared online, there is substantial impact that researchin these \ufb01elds can have. However, models trained on current\ndatasets are prone to the biases of sighted humans. The ques-\ntions asked in VQA datasets, and the captions given in imagecaptioning datasets do not necessarily cater to the needs of\npossible end users of this technology. A lot is said in the \ufb01eld\nof the technology being applied to aid those with variouslevels of sight impairment, but little action is actually taken.\n123\nGraph neural networks in vision-language image understanding: a survey\nWhilst the release of trained models is promising, making\nthese models available outside of the research communitywould be bene\ufb01cial. Another direction the community could\ntake is building on the work of VizWiz [ 153], a Vision-\nLanguage dataset curated for those with low vision. Thedataset aims to highlight the accessibility requirements indi-viduals with (severe) sight impairment require from models\nwithin this space. Whilst VizWiz [ 153] focuses on the VQA\ntask, a similar route could be taken for image captioning,enabling researchers to tune models to ensure that the gen-\nerated captions are useful to the people who need them the\nmost.\nThe state of the art (SOTA) in Vision-Language tasks\nis currently dominated by large Transformer-based models\ndeveloped by industrial labs [ 154\u2013156]. This makes compar-\ning these models to those discussed in this paper dif\ufb01cultgiven the model size and compute power used for training.\nHowever, there are a few take home points.\nIn the case of image captioning, the Transformer-based\nmodel M2 is outperformed by GNN-based architectures,\nnamely Dual-GCN [ 89]. This leads the authors to posit that\nthere is a strong inductive bias in using imposed graph struc-tures rather than allowing all relationships between detected\nobjects to be processed using self-attention. The use of a\nglobal context graph (taking into account the whole dataset)alongside a local context graph (image-level relationships)by Dual-GCN [ 89] is shown to work extremely well and this\ndual graph approach could be the seed for future works.\nIt could be that given the scale of the models currently\nachieving SOTA that there are some emergent properties that\ndevelop in these models when they achieve such as scale.\nFuture work should consider scaling graph-based architec-tures, such as those discussed in this survey, to the scale of\nthe large models being produced by industry labs.\nFor FVQA and image retrieval, the graph-based approaches\nhave stronger inductive biases for the reasoning stages of thetasks. Both tasks require the processing of graph data (in\nthe case of a knowledge graph in FVQ or some graph rep-\nresentation of the search space in image retrieval). It is welldocumented that Transformers do not perform well on sparse\ngraphs (such as knowledge graphs) or large graphs (such as\nthose used in image retrieval).\nThe adoption of GNN-based image captioning techniques\nhas proved promising. Given that this approach is relatively\nnew, there is ample opportunity for further research to becarried out in this \ufb01eld. As shown in Sect. 4, the majority\nof image captioning techniques make use of either GCN\nor GGNN architectures. As GNNs develop and newer more\nexpressive techniques are approached, the community shouldmove to adopt these over traditional message passing style\nnetworks. Models such as GAT [ 102] may provide advan-\ntages over the techniques being used as they incorporateself-attention mechanisms into the architecture, a techniqueproved to yield impressive results given the popularity of the\nTransformer.\nAll the GNNs being used in the Vision-Language tasks\ndiscussed in the survey are built on the concept of homophily,\ni.e. similar nodes are connected by an edge. This is not alwaysthe case though given that a semantic graph connects dissim-ilar objects that are semantically related. Some of the graphs\ndetailed are homophilic (e.g. image graph), but many oth-\ners are not. This leads us to speculate that there are ampleresearch opportunities for applying GNN architectures that\nrespect the amount of homophily or heterophily of the graph\nbeing processed.\nAnother direction of research would be investigating com-\nbinations of different graph representations (at both the image\nlevel and dataset level) to identify combinations that workwell together. Using different graph representations willallow for better utilisation of both local and global features.\nThe incorporation of outside knowledge into image cap-\ntioning could provide an interesting research direction. It isoften pointed out that image captioning is a useful accessi-\nbility technology for those with sight impairment. However,\nthis assumes the user is an adult with a developed understand-ing of the world. Image captioning systems may struggle to\nbe applied in a paediatric accessibility setting. Having the\nmodel explain the world in greater detail may be of use.\nAnother potential future research direction would be the\nuni\ufb01cation of the three tasks discussed in this paper. Devel-\noping a single uni\ufb01ed model that could perform competently\nin all three would hail an important breakthrough. In order toperform this, a model would have to have a common inter-\nmediary space for which it could map between the text and\nimage spaces. We posit that this space would most likelybe graph-based due to their expressive nature. However, a\ntextual representation may also be performant as Gao et al.\n[130] showed reasoning in the text space improved perfor-\nmance over graph-based reasoning in VQA.\nIn summary, Vision-Language tasks such as those dis-\ncussed in this paper are set to have a fruitful future, with many\nopportunities for various graph structures to be exploited.\nAuthor Contributions H.S. conducted the literature survey and devel-\noped the arguments presented in the paper.

One should then heed the growing chorus of warnings\nthat the West is about to become the target, rather than perpetrator, of \u201cshockand awe.\u201d\nThere is a signi\u00aacant fault, however, in the theme of impending cyber apoca -\nlypse: it is far from clear that con\u00baict over the internet can actually function as\nwar. Predictions about the nature or signi\u00aacance of cyberwar generally commita common fallacy in arguing from opportunity to outcome, rather than consid -\nering whether something that could happen is at all likely , given the motives\nof those who are able to act. Cyber pessimism rests heavily on capabilities(means), with little thought to a companion logic of consequences (ends).Much that could happen in the world fails to occur, largely because those whocan act discern no meaningful bene\u00aat from initiating a given act. Put anotherway , advocates have yet to work out how cyberwar enables aggressors toaccomplish tasks typically associated with terrestrial military violence. Ab-sent this logic of consequences, cyberwar is unlikely to prove as pivotal inworld affairs, and for developed nations, in particular, as many observersseem to believe.\nThis article assesses the salience of the internet for carrying out func-\ntions commonly identi\u00aaed with terrestrial political violence. War is funda-mentally a political process, as Carl von Clausewitz famously explained.\n6\nStates, groups, and individuals threaten harm to deter or compel, generatingin\u00bauence through the prospect of damage or loss. Military force can also be ex -\nercised to maintain or alter the balance of power and resist or impose disputed\noutcomes. The internet is generally an inferior substitute to terrestrial force inperforming the functions of coercion or conquest. Cyber \u201cwar\u201d is not likelyto serve as the \u00aanal arbiter of competition in an anarchical world and soshould not be considered in isolation from more traditional forms of politicalviolence.\n7The capacity for internet coercion is further limited by some of the\nsame factors that make cyberwar appear at \u00aarst so intimidating. For threats ordemands to prove effective, targets must believe both that an attack is likely tofollow from noncompliance and that the attack is destined to in\u00baict unaccept -\nable harm. Yet, as I detail here, the need to apprise targets of internet vulnera -International Security 38:2 42\n5.

Hannah Arendt wrote, \u201cThe chief reason warfare is still with us i s... that no substitute for this\n\u00aanal arbiter in international affairs has yet appeared on the political scene.\u201d Arendt, On Violence\n(New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1970), p. 2.\nbilities to make cyber threats credible contrasts with the secrecy required to\nensure an effective attack.\nGiven the inherent dif\u00aaculty of credibly threatening cyberattacks without\nalso compromising operational effectiveness, it will be tempting for actors topractice cyberwar rather than engage in coercive threats. Here, too, however,key limitations exist regarding what can be achieved over the internet. It is onething for an opponent to interrupt a country\u2019s infrastructure, communications,or military coordination and planning. It is another to ensure that the damagein\u00baicted translates into a lasting shift in the balance of national power or re -\nsolve. Cyberattacks are unlikely to prove particularly potent in grand strategic\nterms unless they can impose substantial, durable harm on an adversary . Inmany , perhaps most, circumstances, this will occur only if cyberwar is accom -\npanied by terrestrial military force or other actions designed to capitalize on\nany temporary incapacity achieved via the internet. Those initiating cyber-attacks must therefore decide whether they are prepared to exploit the win-dows of opportunity generated by internet attacks through other modes ofcombat. If they are not willing and able to do so, then in grand strategic terms,there are few compelling reasons to initiate cyberwar. The need to back upcyber with other modes of con\u00baict in turn suggests that the chief bene\u00aaci-aries of cyberwar are less likely to be marginal groups or rising challengerslooking to overturn the existing international order and more likely to benation-states that already possess important terrestrial military advantages.Conceived of in this way , the internet poses no revolution in military affairsbut instead promises simply to extend existing international disparities inpower and in\u00bauence.\nThe remainder of this article is organized into \u00aave sections. After a brief re -\nview of the burgeoning literature on cyberwar, the subsequent section lays out\nthe case for a logic of consequences. It is not enough to determine what couldhappen in a world where so much is possible. The third section applies basicinsights about the nature of war to detail critical shortcomings of cyberwar as apolitical instrument. The Pearl Harbor attacks admirably illustrate the inade -\nquacies of con\u00baict in cyberspace. Section four addresses additional implica -\ntions and limitations of the main argument, while the \u00aafth section offers some\nconcluding remarks.\nPanic over the Internet: The Literature on Cyberwar\nThe character of war has evolved, if not regularly , then certainly at variouspoints in history . As such, it is reasonable, even forward looking, for observersto consider what impact each new technology might have on the nature of warThe Myth of Cyberwar 43\nand peace. Innovations such as the stirrup, steam propulsion, the airplane, and\nthe exploding shell transformed warfare. Other changes, such as the tele -\nphone, high-rise construction techniques, and the advent of effective birth con -\ntrol, may have been less revolutionary than evolutionary in their military\neffects. A large and growing literature seeks to alert\u2014some might say alarm\u2014observers to the dangers of cyberwar. These studies shine much less light onhow cyberspace is destined to change the nature of political con\u00baict thanon what harm it is possible to perpetrate over the internet.\nscope and scale conditions of cyberwar\u2014cyber pessimists\nFor many thoughtful commentators, the size and scope of the cyberwar threatcould be unprecedented. William Lynn III argues that cyberwarfare is indeed asubstantial, imminent threat.\n8Those with a motive to launch an attack against\nthe United States will soon possess the capability to do so. In this sense,cyberwarfare is unique in that opponents who utilize the strategy are not lim-ited by \u00aanancial or physical constraints. Lynn advocates a vigorous defenseas the most viable and \u00baexible strategy in cyberspace. The United Statescan avoid large-scale cyber calamities through the collaboration of public, pri-vate, and government-sponsored corporations. In a follow-on article, Lynnoutlines a \u00aave-pillared cyberspace defense strategy , \u201ctreating cyberspace as anoperational domain, like land, air, sea, and outer space; employing active de-fenses to stop malicious code before it affects our networks; protecting com-mercial networks that operate the critical infrastructure that our military reliesupon; joining with allies to mount a collective cyber defense; and mobilizingindustry to redesign network technology with security in mind.\u201d\n9\nTreating cyberspace as an operational domain is an excellent idea, but doing\nso quickly reveals differences between internet con\u00baict and warfare on land,sea, in the air, or in space. Deterring or even defending against cyberattackmay prove dif\u00aacult, as others have argued, but it will prove much harder stillfor an attacker to \u00aagure out how to bene\u00aat from internet aggression, unlesscyberattacks occur in conjunction with attacks in other domains.\nJames Adams anticipates Lynn in arguing for a comprehensive U.S. cyber -\nwarfare defense strategy .\n10The United States is vulnerable to attack becauseInternational Security 38:2 44\n8.

Richard Clark and RobertKnake offer early examples of cyberwar.\n12They claim that the United States\nhas been slow to orient itself to what they argue could be a national securitynightmare. Shane Courville also considers the United States to be highly sus -\nceptible to a catastrophic cyberattack, but he is pessimistic about the ability of\nthe United States or other nations to defend themselves.\n13Cyber defense is\nproblematic given rapidly changing technology .

As they explain it, \u201c[T]he term Netwar refers to an emergingmode of con\u00baict (and crime) at societal levels, involving measures short of tra -\nditional war.\u201d\n21Arquilla and Ronfeldt argue that \u201ccyberwar\u201d has become mis -\nleading with the advent of newer technology . However, while Netwar and\ntraditional cyberwar differ in their respective forms, each is a potentially cata-strophic threat.\nthe attribution problem and international law\nIt has been argued that one of the most important, and potentially menac-ing, characteristics of cyberwar involves anonymity . David Clark and SusanLandau highlight attribution as a critical issue that is dif\u00aacult to overcome inseeking to deter cyberattacks.\n22As they argue, \u201cRetaliation requires knowing\nwith full certainty who the attackers are.\u201d23Similarly , Martin Libicki is con-\ncerned that the internet may create intractable dif\u00aaculties in seeking to deterwould-be perpetrators.\n24As he explains the problem, \u201cThe lower the odds of\ngetting caught, the higher the penalty required to convince potential attackersthat what they might achieve is not worth the cost.\u201d\n25Attackers are much\nmore likely to strike if they are unlikely to be targeted in return.\nThe focus is again on the potential for harm, rather than on exploring the\nmotives and operational logic of perpetrators.

Targeting improves with information about perpetrators, but blanket retaliationcould also prove effective, provided that punishment also touches the attackers. At the same time,no one ever possesses \u201cfull certainty .\u201d The U.S. legal standard is \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d24. Martin C.

Where anonymity protects an aggressor from retribution, it also\ndilutes credit for the deed. Vandals often \u201ctag\u201d their handiwork\u2014creating anidentity where none need exist\u2014precisely because real anonymity means notreceiving credit for one\u2019s handiwork. Internet vandals also brand their ex -\nploits, presumably because they wish to receive credit for their exploits, even\nat some risk to their anonymity .\nJust as ongoing cyberattacks from unidenti\u00aaed sources do not give the target\na way to retaliate, they also fail to provide the target with the means to acqui -\nesce. Demands from an anonymous cyberwarrior will tend to be ignored or re -\nneged upon once vulnerabilities are identi\u00aaed and addressed. Demands might\nalso come from a source that did not, or was even incapable of, mounting acyberattack. As with the use of identifying symbols in war, it is in an attacker\u2019sinterest to \u201cbrand\u201d its actions to most effectively elicit concessions from atarget. Indeed, even if demands are complied with, an attacker will have dif-\u00aaculty obtaining sustained compliance, given the impossibility of demonstrat-ing future capabilities.\nDiscussion of attribution problems in cyberspace also re\u00baects a subtle but\ntelling shift in framing. Libicki\u2019s simple calculus of deterrence, for example, in-volves \u201cgetting caught,\u201d something more often characteristic of crime thanwar. Some aspects of international relations involve anonymity . Espionage, co-vert operations, and certain kinds of political theft or murder function most ef-fectively when the perpetrators are unknown, or indeed when the operationsthemselves remain undisclosed. Strategic or tactical advantage can also stemfrom anonymity and surprise in terrestrial military missions, though nationsand groups often sacri\u00aace surprise and advertise their role in contests to ex -\ntract concessions or tacit or formal admission of defeat. How does one surren -\nder to no one in particular? The advantage of anonymity will persist for\nperipheral forms of warfare on the internet, just as it has played a role in ter -\nrestrial competition and con\u00baict. Most forms of political con\u00baict, however,\nencourage disclosing an initiator\u2019s identity . Coercion requires attribution. Sim -\nilarly , threats designed to elicit concessions or deter aggression are already\nproblematic in physical space.\n26This \u201ccredibility problem\u201d mirrors the attri -\nbution problem and is perhaps equally likely to make internet aggression\nproblematic for initiators as for possible targets.The Myth of Cyberwar 47\n26.

There has not yet been suf\u00aacient time, or perhaps the inclination,\nto solidify the legal standing of cyber con\u00baict in international law. CharlesDunlap notes that democracies, in particular, have sidestepped attemptsto formulate a treaty covering cyber con\u00baict.\n27Indeed, it is inherently dif -\n\u00aacult to legally de\u00aane a process when capabilities have yet to be uncovered.\nCyberattacks could perhaps be looked upon as the legal equivalent to armedattacks.\n28Yet, the legal de\u00aanition of armed con\u00baict involves \u201csigni\u00aacantly de -\nstructive attacks taking place over some period of time and conducted by a\ngroup that is well-organized,\u201d29a set of conditions yet to be adequately dem -\nonstrated in cyberspace.\ncyber salience\u2014a balancing of perspectives\nWhile the bulk of reactions to cyberwar emphasize dramatic dangers, somestudies offer a more balanced perspective. Tim Maurer contrasts the gloomypicture provided by the bulk of writers with estimates of likely determinantsof loss of life associated with a cyberattack.\n30Maurer lists the relative secu-\nrity of civilian infrastructure, participation of nonstate actors, and the evolu-tion of law regarding retaliation strategies. He concludes that loss of life fromcyberattacks will generally be slight. Indeed, drawing on his estimates, Maurerasserts that \u201ca digital Pearl Harbor would cost fewer lives than the attack70 years ago.\u201d\n31\nWesley Clark and Peter Levin anticipate an inevitable rise in cyberwarfare,\none that will eventually involve broad sectors of society .32Populations will\nface \u201cnetwork-born disruptions of critical national infrastructure\u201d\u2014includingterrestrial and airborne traf\u00aac, energy generation and distribution, and the\u00aanancial system.

The United States has\npledged a reported $30 billion by 2015 as part of the Comprehensive NationalCyber Security Initiative. In addition, Clark and Levin note lessons learnedfrom previous attacks. The most effective electronic security strategy must op -\nerate under full disclosure. Experts in academic, industrial, and governmental\nsectors must quickly collaborate on a mitigation strategy . Yet, Clark and Levinalso acknowledge that \u201celectronic security works best when it is autonomous,adaptable, distributed and diversi\u00aaed.\u201d\n33\nStephen Walt argues that a critical preliminary task is to separate out differ -\nent dangers grouped under the common rubric of \u201ccyber-warfare.\u201d34For Walt,\ncyberwarfare consists of four distinct issues: degrading an enemy\u2019s militarycapabilities, penetrating networks to shut down civilian infrastructure, web-based criminal activity , and cyber espionage. These four issues help to framecyberwarfare as an evolving, nuanced set of issues, each amenable to its owncost-bene\u00aat analysis. Thomas Rid argues that cyberwar is not really warbecause it fails to conform to conventional de\u00aanitions of con\u00baict.\n35Rid\u2019s chief\npoint\u2014mirroring in an interesting manner Maurer\u2019s argument\u2014is that cyber-war is not suf\u00aaciently violent or casualty-producing to be considered war. Assuch, cyberwar is a misnomer. This perspective risks becoming a purely aca-demic exercise, however, if cyber con\u00baict eventually supplants military vio-lence as the ultimate arbiter of international politics. Cyberwar does not needto be war to make war obsolete. Instead, it must ful\u00aall the existing functions ofterrestrial warfare if it is to rival the utility of existing forms of con\u00baict.

Lacking information about whether developments areradical or merely incremental, it may make sense to adopt a few guidelinesthat will help to determine whether there is cause for panic. A reasonable levelof caution is usually provided by our own common sense. Most readers willlock their doors at night, for example, and refrain from handling large sumsof cash in a dark alley . Imagining what others could do to injure each ofus, however, can quickly descend into paranoia. It is not reasonable to believethat someone is intent on mischief simply because it is possible for them toin\u00baict harm.\nEven in the safest of societies, individuals, groups, and entire communities\nare subject to an enormous variety of potential hazards. Much could be doneto impinge on each of us, even though few of these possibilities are ever exer-cised, or experienced, with any regularity . The physical world hosts a multi-tude of venues for extremely unlikely accident or disease. A small number ofpeople prefer to remain indoors rather than risk being struck by lightning orstruck down by botchulism. Still, individuals with these concerns may meritmore attention from psychiatric professionals than from military planners. Be-ing vulnerable will be novel to no one living in our modern, highly integratedworld. Indeed, the capacity to hurt is so ubiquitous in densely populated por -\ntions of the globe that blood would coat the streets if it were not true that rela -\ntively little relationship exists between the capacity to attack and the actual\nprospect that one will be invaded, assaulted, or otherwise done in.\n37\nJust about anything is possible.

The current fascination with vampires (in popular culture) and zombies (among academics) il -\nlustrates the basic point. Aggression becomes endemic if harm has an intrinsic payoff (e.g., human\nbeings are food). Vampires and zombies threaten not just individuals but the whole of civil society ,because interdependence/specialization requires that vulnerability not equal insecurity .\nwrong time. When a commuter steps outside to start her car or to catch\nthe bus, it is impossible to be certain that no truck will jump the curb and thatevery asteroid will remain in its usual orbit. And yet, despite endless potentialfor injury or death, few of us have chosen to harden our living rooms againstcruise missile attack or immersed ourselves in real-time plots from NASAcharting the trajectories of space detritus. In dealing with known unknowns,we became comfortable with not being protected. California homeownerstypically do not carry earthquake insurance, for example, even though \u201cthebig one\u201d is an eventuality . We do so because security is expensive; being in -\ndemni\u00aaed against unlikely events may literally not be worth the effort. One\ncould buy that bulletproof vest listed on Ebay , but then how often wouldit prove fashionable at the of\u00aace or in the classroom? The probabilities of eso -\nteric catastrophe are by their nature minute. Unlikely events are unlikely , and\nso most of us go about our business, paying little attention to the potentialmenace from the skies or, for that matter, from one another.\nGovernments face similar realities. Many threats are conceivable, but rela-\ntively few actually materialize. A holistic approach to security involves assess-ing risks, and then allocating \u00aanite resources to address tractable threats,making the largest improvements in protection or, conversely , the greatest in-creases in in\u00bauence.\n38Every dollar spent on national defense must be taken\nfrom objectives such as improving education, building or repairing infrastruc-ture, or paying down the debt. Only extremely af\u00bauent (or paranoid) pop-ulations pay the price of pursuing protection from the most exotic hazards.More to the point, protection is inevitably incomplete, and comes with itsown consequences, including other forms of insecurity . The risk of attackis never zero, given that a potent defense or deterrent endangers the securityof others.\n39\nIf violence is ecological, why do human beings not live in consummate fear?\nMost of us are safe because the multitudes capable of causing us harm have lit -\ntle interest in doing so. For the most part, violence does little that potential per -\npetrators view as worth their while. Humanity is protected by an invisibleThe Myth of Cyberwar 51\n38. The distinction between security and in\u00bauence is often missed or misrepresented in policy de -\nbates. For example, although discussions often center on protecting the American people (secu -\nrity), much of U.S. defense spending actually purchases discretion abroad (in\u00bauence).\n39.

Yet, you are prob -\nably not going to die a violent death in the next minute, or at any other time.\nThe potential for violence is both ubiquitous and seldom realized becausestriking out, though often possible, does little to bene\u00aat the violator. The use offorce is costly , risky , and mostly unproductive. When we learn of violence, ournatural inclination is to ask \u201cwhy?\u201d Like a police detective, we seek a motive.Violence requires a cause. When, on occasion, we cannot identify the logic be -\nhind a perpetrator\u2019s choice of a target, the experience is remarkable, and con -\nsiderably puzzling.\nMost of us are capable of seriously injuring others, but for the most part we\nfail to exercise our capabilities because there is no positive reason to strike. Adriver behind the wheel of an automobile can cause enormous damage or lossof life, and yet pedestrians walk in front of stopped vehicles at an intersection,with little care or attention to the fact that a tap of a toe on the accelerator is allit takes to end their lives. The mere capacity to harm is just not a very goodpredictor of aggression, because the potential for harm is everywhere but sel-dom practiced. Few of us are likely to be the target of attack, and so each of uscan greet the day with minimal anxiety , to say nothing of personal security , notbecause we are thoroughly protected, but because causing harm is usually in-convenient, unnecessary , or pointless for potential perpetrators. Attacking us(or others) serves no purpose.\nThe internet makes it possible to interact with people just about anywhere\non the globe as easily , or even more easily , than conversing with the neighborsnext door. Initial attention to the mobility of cyberspace focused on the poten -\ntial for good, but convenience also overcomes barriers to con\u00baict. The supply\nof targets for cyber acts of aggression is certainly huge relative to the supply ofperpetrators of physical violence. Viewed in this way , it is remarkable thatcyberspace has yet to become exclusively the domain of fraud, identity theft,and other acts of predation, interspersed only with pornography and the occa -\nsional Nigerian emailer looking to deposit millions in your bank account. Yet,\nif the internet makes it easy to reach out and touch others, it in no way makesthose contacts profound. Casual attempts to undermine one\u2019s welfare abound,but it is with equal casualness that we ignore the bulk of spam or internet sitesmarketing lapsed software. Predation continues unabated on the world wideweb, but if it is easy to reach us, contact is all the more super\u00aacial.\nThe bulk of internet traf\u00aac is benign. Cyberspace has not made life moreInternational Security 38:2 52\ndangerous for the multitudes. There are crimes on the internet, but it is unclear\nwhether these have increased the overall crime rate. Internet crime often sub -\nstitutes for crimes that would have been committed in terrestrial space never -\ntheless. Perhaps even more to the point, much of internet fraud and cyber\nviolence is intrinsically tied to the physical domain; much of the harm initiatedon the internet eventually gets perpetrated in more conventional ways.\nThe safety from predation that mass populations achieve as a result of num -\nbers and anonymity is denied political institutions and their representatives.\nOrganizations and certainly countries have personnel and property that can betargeted with violence. How might this shift in the nature of the target affectthe risk of cyberattack? Once again, we must inquire not about what couldhappen but why individuals, groups, or nations might act.\nNations and organizations can be attacked through the internet, just as they\nhave long been attacked in physical space. The ease with which such attackscan be perpetrated is an obvious, and much discussed, phenomenon. Physi-cal space has always been an important barrier to con\u00baict.\n40Even today , the\nsingle best predictor of interstate con\u00baict is contiguity .41Lowering the cost to\ntransmit an attack, however, only increases its appeal if the attack is also capa-ble of achieving the actor\u2019s desired ends. Beyond numbers and anonymity , themain factor protecting individuals is even more potent for institutions; howforce will produce the desired change is often unclear. Cyberattacks can beappealing as political acts only to the degree that they affect the decisions thatorganizations and sovereigns make with and without cyber violence. Becauseunderstanding how cyberwar can (and cannot) in\u00bauence politics is largely thesame as understanding how conventional military violence acts on politics, Iturn next to a brief discussion of the nature of terrestrial warfare.\nWar and Peace in the Internet Age\nU.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta returned to the theme of a cyber \u201cPearlHarbor\u201d more than once.

The analogy may be apt, but almost cer -\ntainly not for the reasons contemplated by Secretary Panetta. The situation in\n1941 serves as a basis for comparison and a point of departure in examiningcyberwar. To understand why a cyber Pearl Harbor is not as threatening as itsounds, it helps to review what the air raids on December 7, 1941, were meantto accomplish and what they achieved.\nBefore exploring Secretary Panetta\u2019s Pearl Harbor analogy , however, I \u00aarst\ndiscuss the nature of war and how key attributes of warfare function or fail viathe internet. States and nonstate actors make war to further their interestswhen incompatibilities exist between those interests, and when alternativemethods of con\u00baict resolution are deemed ineffective or inef\u00aacient. Althoughmany con\u00baicts are conceivable, most potential wars do not occur because theparticipants recognize that threats or uses of force are futile. Only some acts ofviolence are likely to achieve the objectives for which political actors strive. Ifthe futility of violence discourages the bulk of terrestrial con\u00baict, it is an evenlarger concern in cyberwar.\na brief look at the logic of war\nThe theory of war provides two basic mechanisms for the expression of politi -\ncal interests through physical violence. First, force can be used to punish or\ncompel, indirectly affecting the state of the world by harming an enemy tomake it do something that it would not do otherwise, or alternately discourag -\ning change by raising the price of aggression. Just about everyone from parents\nto police and prime ministers seems to grasp the intuition behind creating con -\nsequences to modify behavior. Second, force can be used to conquer, directly\nimposing one\u2019s will by capturing and controlling inhabitants or resources con -\ntained in a given physical space. One thing that the recent \u201cOccupy\u201d move -\nment shared with the U.S. military was the conviction that denial can prove\neffective if exercised for a suf\u00aacient period of time.\n43The ability to conquer orInternational Security 38:2 54\n42.

Panetta to be Secretary of Defense, June 9, 2011, Washington, D.C., http:/ /www. armed-services.senate.gov/Transcripts/2011/06%20June/11-47%20-%206-9-11.pdf, p. 25.43. The whole question of denial/conquest depends on whether a target is likely to acquiesce. TheBritish have occupied Scotland for centuries, with some success. They occupied Ireland for just\ncompel can, in turn, be used to achieve these objectives through actual force\n(offense or defense), overt threats (deterrence or compellence), or the shadowof war (e.g., diplomacy).\n44\nDuring the Cold War, the two superpowers could easily have annihilated\neach other, along with much of the rest of the world. Yet, vast nuclear arsenalsremained dormant, and the prospect of mutual harm even led to the peculiarstability of mutual assured destruction. Again, the mere capacity to hurt tellsus relatively little about the actual advent of violence, even though the poten -\ntial in the Cold War was extraordinary and mutual assured destruction, by its\nnature, meant that devastation could not be prevented. Indeed, it was this mu -\ntual vulnerability that many credit with the Cold War remaining cold.\n45\nIn contrast, Japan kept even its own diplomats in the dark about its plans to\nattack U.S. bases in the Philippines and Hawaii because it could not share in-formation about its intentions with U.S. of\u00aacials without fatally weakening theeffectiveness of such a plan.\n46President Richard Nixon reportedly threatened\nto restart the Christmas bombing campaign against Hanoi to expedite the talksfor ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. The threat could be made un-der any circumstances, but it was more credible given that Hanoi had recentlybeen attacked and the consequences of renewed heavy bombing were alsoclear. Whether force is threatened or carried out depends on whether threatscan be made without degrading the instruments of military advantage. Reve-lation of the ability to harm can prove suf\u00aaciently compelling to cause a targetto make concessions or to alter the target\u2019s behavior. Conversely , if threateningan enemy makes an eventual attack less effective, then the temptation may beto strike rather than threaten.\nExperts on cyber security have failed to draw the same conclusions from\nthe inability to protect that strategists drew from the Cold War. It is truethat mutual assured destruction may not exist in cyberspace, as it did in thepost\u2013World War II terrestrial world. Whether the internet is a different kind ofstrategic setting, and what this means in terms of what can and cannot beThe Myth of Cyberwar 55\nabout the same length of time with very little lasting political effect.

Although\nthe Cold War is remembered as the ideal deterrence environment, strategicthinkers and government of\u00aacials struggled with how they could exercisein\u00bauence in such a world. The mere potential for imposing harm did not implythat harm would be imposed, or even that, when imposed or threatened, na -\ntions would respond in an obliging manner. Few could doubt in retrospect that\ncitizens and leaders on both sides of the iron curtain felt vulnerable, especiallyduring the \u00aarst decade or so of the nuclear era. It does not follow, however,that a heightened sense of insecurity was re\u00baected in actual behavioral con -\n\u00baict. Whether warfare in cyberspace will depart radically from previous pat -\nterns, or will mimic, in part or in whole, familiar patterns of con\u00baict from\nearlier eras, will depend on the degree to which the strategic logic of cyberwaris able to accommodate the objectives of political actors in contemplating orexercising coercion.\nNor do students of cyberwar seem much preoccupied with the implications\nof Nixon\u2019s Hanoi bombing campaign. The threatened use of force is intendedin this, and in most other instances, to alter behavior through the prospect oflong-term damage. To the degree that damage can be quickly and easily re-paired, there is not much leverage in raising such a threat. Conversely , detailsharmful to attackers or to the effectiveness or potency of attacks are typicallyconcealed from an opponent, even when this information would signi\u00aacantlyincrease the credibility of coercive threats. Flight plans, bomb loads, and elec-tronic countermeasures used by U.S. B-52s, for example, were not shared withHanoi, because this would have compromised the capacity of U.S. forces tocarry out Nixon\u2019s threat.\nNations, groups, or individuals with the ability to in\u00baict harm must ask not\njust how much can be in\u00baicted at what cost, but also what is to be achievedthrough force, and whether these ends are justi\u00aaed compared to the price andavailability of other, typically cheaper, mechanisms. Force, or the threat offorce, is useful as punishment to the degree that the harm imposed is substan -\ntial and durable. Damage that can be quickly or easily undone will not do\nmuch to deter or compel, but it will alert an enemy to vulnerabilities in its de -\nfenses, and certainly also antagonize an opponent, increasing the risk of coun -\nterattack and general hostility . The threat or exercise of physical conquest can\nbe effective provided the perpetrator \u00aands it worthwhile to engage in the cost -\nliest form of politics. Here, again, the simple ability to act aggressively is not it -\nself suf\u00aacient to predict aggression. The United States could probably conquer\nCanada if it chose to, and yet Canada remains free and independent. Moststates, groups, and individuals persist in peace because they can conceive ofInternational Security 38:2 56\nno bene\u00aat from force, even if violence, and victory , are feasible. The mere abil -\nity to cause harm over the internet does not suf\u00aace to predict that cyberwar\nwill substitute for terrestrial con\u00baict, or even that it will be an important inde -\npendent domain for the future of warfare.\nwarfare in cyberspace\nBeyond questions of means and motive, two basic features make cyberwarfaredifferent from other types of con\u00baict. First, much of the damage contemplatedby cyberwar is in all likelihood temporary . The assumption among many cyberpessimists that the potential for creating harm is suf\u00aacient to make cyberspacea suitable substitute for, or indeed alternative to, terrestrial con\u00baict is incorrect.Shutting down power grids, closing airports, or derailing communicationcould be tremendously costly , but most damage of this type will be \u00aaxedquickly and at comparatively modest investment of tangible resources. Re-gardless, damage of this type is sunk. Losses experienced over a given intervalcannot be recovered whatever one\u2019s reactions and so should not have much di-rect impact on subsequent policy behavior. Harm in\u00baicted over the internet orany other medium will matter politically when it alters the subsequent balanceof power, or when it indicates enemy capabilities that must be taken into ac-count in future plans. Because cyberwar does not involve bombing cities ordevastating armored columns, the damage in\u00baicted will have a short-term im-pact on its targets.\n47To accomplish politically meaningful objectives, cyber-\nattacks must contribute to other aspects of a more conventional war effort.And to affect the long-term balance of power, for instance, cyberwar must bejoined to other, more traditional, forms of war.\nTemporary damage can be useful under two circumstances. First, compro -\nmising or incapacitating networks might give an enemy valuable tactical, or\neven strategic, advantages. An opponent that cannot shoot, move, resupply ,or communicate will be easier to defeat. Nonetheless, the advantaged partymust still act through some medium of combat to seize the initiative. Notionsthat cyberattacks will themselves prove pivotal in future war are reminiscentof World War I artillery barrages that cleared enemy trenches but still requiredthe infantry and other arms to achieve a breakout. Whether an actor canbene\u00aat from cyberwar depends almost entirely on whether the actor is able toThe Myth of Cyberwar 57\n47. In the 1970s, the so-called neutron bomb promised high casualties with minimal damage to\nphysical structures. It might be tempting to think of cyberweapons as anti-neutron bombs, becausethey damage infrastructure, leaving people largely unharmed. Yet, this is also a key limitation ofcyberwar, as damage is temporary and far from complete.\ncombine a cyberattack with some other method\u2014typically kinetic warfare\u2014\nthat can convert temporary advantages achieved over the internet into a last -\ning effect. In the parlance of war, internet attacks produce a \u201csoft kill\u201d that is\nvaluable only when attackers prosecute follow-on attacks with traditional mil -\nitary force or permanently weaken an enemy in some other way .48\nThe notion of a devastating surprise attack is a particularly baroque aspect\nof cyberwar paranoia, and is certainly frightening to the degree that such sce -\nnarios are accurate. Yet, the idea of a surprise internet attack is misleading and\nrelies on a fundamental misconception of the role of internet-based aggression.Modern warfare seldom allows any one element of combat to prove pivotal.Instead, it is the ability to combine elements into a complex whole that increas -\ningly distinguishes the adept utilization of force.\n49\nThe archetype of modern, combined arms warfare is the blitzkrieg, where\nthe lethality and decisiveness of conventional military violence is enhanced byactions designed to disrupt the enemy\u2019s military and civilian infrastructure.An important element of blitzkrieg was the use of terror weapons, such as theJu 87 \u201cStuka\u201d dive bomber, to sow panic, causing enemy populations to \u00baoodroads and railways, thereby crippling transportation grids needed by the de-fense. Yet, fear is temporary and in the absence of substance, subsides. TheStukas were effective only as long as Germany held other military advantagesover its enemies. Similarly , unless Stuka attacks were accompanied by aground attack or an invasion, their role as terror weapons was largely redun-dant. Stukas contributed little to Germany\u2019s effort to subdue Great Britain, forexample. Stuka units experienced heavy casualties when engaged against a so -\nphisticated air defense and were eventually removed from service in the Battle\nof Britain. The hubris of Luftwaffe Commander in Chief Hermann G\u00f6ring inpromising victory while exploiting just one domain (the air) was precisely thathe exaggerated the effectiveness of a new technology in isolation from other el -\nements of an integrated offense.\nThere is no reason to believe that cyberwar will be any more useful as an iso -\nlated instrument of coercive foreign policy . An attack that causes temporary\nharm will inevitably be followed by countermeasures and heightened vigi -\nlance, as has happened, for example, in Estonia in the aftermath of the 2007 at -\ntacks. For cyber aggression to have lasting effects, a virtual attack must beInternational Security 38:2 58\n48. Nonlethal weapons have similar functionality . Immobilizing an enemy with sticky foam\nworks until it does not; nonlethal weapons are effective only if they are followed up by other ac -\ntions, such as physical restraint or redeployment of forces away from the immediate area.\n49. Stephen Biddle, Military Power: Explaining Victory and Defeat in Modern Battle (Princeton, N.J.:\nPrinceton University Press, 2004).\ncombined with physical intervention. Knocking out communications or power\ninfrastructure could cause tremendous disruption, but the ability to quickly re -\ncover from such attacks implies that the consequences for the balance of na -\ntional power would be negligible. The need to follow virtual force with physical\nforce to achieve lasting political consequences suggests that the application ofcyberwarfare independent of conventional forms of warfare will be of tertiaryimportance in strategic and grand strategic terms. If one cannot foresee circum -\nstances where the terrestrial use of force is plausible independent of cyberwar,\nthen cyberwar is also unlikely to constitute a fundamental threat.\nA second element of the logic of cyberwar has to do with in\u00bauence. Rather\nthan attacking directly , an actor can use the potential to harm (deterrence orcompellence). The ability to shut down the U.S. energy grid, say , might beused to compel U.S. of\u00aacials to refrain from aggressive policies or actions, or topersuade the United States to make diplomatic concessions. Yet, the problemwith the standard deterrence or compellence logic in the context of potentialcyberattacks, as I have already pointed out, is that revealing a given setof cybercapabilities heavily degrades their usefulness. Deterrence and compel-lence are therefore marginal as \u201cpure\u201d actions in cyberspace. Indeed, concernsthat nations will not be able to deter cyber aggression amount to recogni-tion that neither will cyber threats prove very effective as threats or induce-ments. Again, actions in cyberspace can be combined with initiatives inphysical space, but this just reinforces the fact that, rather than a distinct formof con\u00baict, cyberwar is basically tied to conventional forms of warfare.\nImagine for a moment that a foreign power has hacked into the communica -\ntions systems of the United States or another major Western power. Imagine\nfurther that this foreign power can disable cellular phone systems or militaryradio networks more or less at will. The foreign power could threaten its targetwith this capability , but obviously the leadership of the target state must beskeptical of such a threat, because the foreign power could easily be bluf\u00aang.Proof of the capacity to damage the target nation is needed, but such evidencewould, in turn, jeopardize the potency or effectiveness of the cyberattack,allowing the target to address some or all of its vulnerabilities or adoptto countermeasures.\nContrast this scenario with the revelation in the 1990s that the United States\nhad developed radar-evading \u201cstealth\u201d aircraft. Knowledge by foreign powersthat a confrontation with the United States would necessarily involve the riskof attack by stealthy \u00aaghters and bombers in no signi\u00aacant way lessened themilitary effectiveness of these weapons systems, given that countermeasuresto stealth technology have been slow to develop. Stealth technology thusThe Myth of Cyberwar 59\nserves as an excellent deterrent/compellent, because it can be used to coerce\nan opponent without sacri\u00aacing much of its military value. The \u201cperishable\u201dnature of capabilities in cyberwar means that advantages generally yield time-bound deterrent or compellent threats, and thus create little in the way of lev -\nerage for states that have, or plan to invest in, cyberwar assets. Deterrent/\ncompellent threats work best when they are tied to capabilities that are notmuch affected by enemy knowledge of the capabilities, whereas the opposite istrue for capabilities that are compromised by the revelation of forces, technolo -\ngies, or attack plans.\nOffensive cyber advantages are thus \u201cuse and lose\u201d capabilities. Revealing\nthe capacity to harm via the internet typically also means tipping the enemyoff to vulnerabilities that can be remedied or compensated for, while in\u00baictingharm seldom has a durable effect on the balance of power. \u201cUse and lose\u201d ca-pabilities cannot compel or deter, because convincing evidence of the capac-ity to in\u00baict harm is itself useful information in nullifying the threat. Ifinstead cyberwar is waged rather than threatened, then the temporary natureof cyber harm dictates that an enemy follow internet attacks with more kineticaction. Otherwise, the use of cyber force is punitive, even provocative. Assuch, cyberwar remains adjunct to terrestrial force unless some way is foundfor cyberattacks to permanently alter the balance of power.\nthe myth of a cyber pearl harbor\nThe air strikes on December 7, 1941, against U.S. military instillations inHawaii and in the Philippines were an important tactical and even strategicvictory for Japan.

The\nU.S. embargo led Japanese of\u00aacials to consider stark alternatives. Either Japanmust relent and withdraw its forces from East Asia, or it would have to cap -\nture oil-rich regions in the south. This, in turn, put Japan in direct con\u00baict with\nthe United States. The Japanese plan was to blunt U.S. naval and military capa -\nbilities temporarily , long enough to prepare a defense in depth in the western\nPaci\u00aac and present the United States with a fait accompli, one that would com -\npel the Americans to submit to a compromise, a negotiated settlement that\nwould end the war.\nThe prospect of an impending and signi\u00aacant relative decline in power and\noptimism about the potential bene\u00aats of a \u201cbounce\u201d giving Japan a temporaryadvantage in the region were critical elements of Japan\u2019s decision to go to war.Importantly , Japan underestimated the psychological impact that the PearlHarbor raid would have in mobilizing U.S. public opinion. Japanese com-manders also overestimated the damage they could in\u00baict on U.S. forces.\n53The\nsurprise assault famously failed to catch the U.S. aircraft carriers in port. It wasthis inability to impair U.S. naval airpower that seemed to vex Yamamoto themost.

Evidence of this is re\u00baected in subsequent efforts by the Imperial Japanese Navy to realizethe original strategic objective. Midway , in particular, was an elaborate trap, masterminded byYamamoto, to locate and destroy the remaining U.S. carrier force in the Paci\u00aac. See, for example,Gordon W. Prange, Miracle at Midway (New York: Penguin, 1983); Jonathan Parshall and Anthony\nTully , Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway (Herndon, Va.: Potomac, 2007);\nMitsuo Fuchida, Midway: The Battle That Doomed Japan (New York: Ballantine, 1986); and Craig L.\nSymonds, The Battle of Midway (New York: Oxford University Press, 2011).\nto prosecute additional offensive action against the target or others. By itself, a\nsurprise attack has limited utility , precisely because surprise fades in time.\nJapanese war planners anticipated the temporal nature of advantages\ngleaned from the Pearl Harbor attack. It was hoped that Japan would be ableto secure critical resources in the south, fortify its gains in depth, and wait outthe American onslaught.\n54At no time did Japan seriously consider unlimited\nwar with the United States. Indeed, Japanese planners recognized the impossi -\nbility of directly defeating the United States.55In the months after December 7,\nthe United States mainland was open to attack. Japanese forces landed in theAleutian Islands, and Japanese submarines shelled a few isolated coastal com -\nmunities, but there were never any serious plans to carry the war to the conti -\nnental United States.\n56\nNow suppose that Japanese of\u00aacials recognized from the outset that they\nwould not be able to target the U.S. carriers or other U.S. military assets withpermanent destruction. Instead, imagine (not very plausibly) that Japanesedive bombers and torpedo planes were \u00aatted with special \u201cdelay bombs\u201d that,unlike delay fuses, would simply disable a ship for hours, days, or possiblyweeks, rather than permanently , or at least for months or years. Faced withthis altered reality , Japanese of\u00aacials and military planners would have beenforced to contemplate a very different war, one that they would almost cer-tainly have preferred not to initiate. In effect, Japan would have had to chooseto precipitate total war, as surprise attacks themselves would not do much todiminish or delay a military response from the United States. The only valueone could anticipate from a surprise attack, then, would be if it facilitated afollow-up invasion of the U.S. mainland. This is the basic shortcoming ofcyberwar. Because cyberattacks involve temporary \u201csoft kills\u201d of a target\u2019s mil -\nitary capabilities and civilian infrastructure, the point of the attack is largely\nnulli\u00aaed if an attacker cannot reasonably be expected to accompany internetaggression with terrestrial strikes designed to make permanent short-termdamage to a target\u2019s security capabilities.\nNo foreign military force is capable of subduing the United States, now or inInternational Security 38:2 62\n54. Louis Morton writes, \u201cJapan planned to \u00aaght a war of limited objectives and, having gained\nwhat it wanted, expected to negotiate for a favorable settlement.\u201d Morton, \u201cJapan\u2019s Decision forW a r , \u201dp .1 1 0 .55.

The invasion of the Aleutians was a feint to distract attention from the attack on Midway .\nthe foreseeable future, with or without the assistance of a phenomenally suc -\ncessful coordinated cyberattack. If cyberwar is unlikely to allow a foreign\npower to permanently overtake U.S. or allied capabilities, and if temporarydamage is useful only when practiced in conjunction with more conventionalmilitary operations, then an opponent must plan and evaluate its use ofcyberwar in relation to its complementarity to terrestrial combat, not as a fullyindependent method of force. If instead a cyberattack is carried out in whichconventional force is either ineffective or not contemplated, then an attack ofthis kind fails to serve a meaningful grand strategic purpose, degrading nei -\nther the target\u2019s longer-term capabilities nor its resolve.\nUnless cyberwar can substitute for a physical surprise attack, there is no rea -\nson to believe that it will be used in place of conventional modes of warfare.\nNor is it clear why an attacker would choose to strike over the internet, unlessa conventional surprise attack is also planned and when it is expected that thecombination of cyber and terrestrial aggression will yield a decisive advantageto the attacker. If it is dif\u00aacult to imagine a particular nation being attacked bytraditional methods of warfare, even with the bene\u00aat of surprise, then it ishard to see how that nation might be fundamentally threatened by warfareconducted over the internet. Indeed, the connection between internet ag-gression and traditional forms of military force imply an unfashionable predic-tion: cyberwar should be particularly appealing to capable states confrontingweaker opponents. Rather than threatening to overturn the existing world or-der, cyberwar may perpetuate or even increase current military inequality .\nAdditional Implications of Cyberwar\nIf cyberwar functions not as an independent domain, but as part of a broader,coordinated military action, then the conventional military balance is the bestindicator of where the most important threats exist in cyberspace. Thus, unlesssomeone believes that economically and militarily advanced nations are indanger of physical attack from a foreign power, the threat of cyberattack can -\nnot be treated as particularly serious in political terms. Most experts view an\nattack that subdues U.S. military capabilities and subjects the U.S. mainland toa foreign power as remote, even fanciful, for example. To the degree that pow -\nerful states are immune to conventional attack, cyberattacks are at most a nui -\nsance and not a fundamental threat.\nIronically , the greatest threat posed by cyberwar may be to those states and\nactors that are thought to be insulated, the same actors that are currently vul -\nnerable to conventional terrestrial aggression. Cyberwar is not a revolution inThe Myth of Cyberwar 63\nmilitary affairs in strategic (military) terms, nor is cyberwar likely to prove\nrevolutionary in political terms, by threatening or transforming existing globalor regional power structures. In this sense, cyberwar appears to be reactionary ,reinforcing the advantages of states that already possess signi\u00aacant terrestrialmilitary advantages. The need to prosecute cyberattacks with more kineticforms of force, and the perishability of cybercapabilities in the face of rev -\nelation, mean that nations with capable militaries are best equipped to exploit\nthe type of damage that cyberwar in\u00baicts, even as they are better able to credi -\nbly threaten cyberattacks and to \u201creveal and replace\u201d a given capability to tar -\nget an enemy\u2019s cyber vulnerabilities. This new mode of warfare, most feared\nby technologically advanced states, may pose greater grand-strategic chal -\nlenges to the technologically backward or weak, something that has not been\nconsidered previously .\nThis is not to say that the sophisticated computer-dependent nations of the\nWest are immune to attack. The United States and other advanced countriesare certainly vulnerable to internet aggression. Instead, the consequencesof this harm will prove ineffectual, because the ability to alter the balance ofpower in regional or world affairs or to exploit capabilities is present only forthose nations and interests that already possess considerable internationalin\u00bauence. We would all like to live in a world where no one could harm useven if someone fervently wished to do so. To the degree that this is not possi-ble, a useful second best is for others to possess disincentives to in\u00baict injury ordeath, even if they still can. An inability to exploit temporary opportunitiescreated by cyberwar is a disincentive to conduct concerted internet attacks. Incontrast, powerful nations continue to possess both the ability and interestin intervening in the developing world, even if they do so only episodically .\nExisting examples of cyberwar illustrate and reinforce this counterintuitive\nconclusion. Attacks on Estonian websites, which appear to have originated inRussia, pitted a tiny nation against a considerable military and economicpower. The ability of Russian leaders to exploit effects of the attack, not just onthe internet but through military and diplomatic pressure, ensured that the im -\npact was much more potent than if equivalent attacks were carried out against\nRussia by nonaligned hackers. Similarly , the Stuxnet worm, which was appar -\nently designed and unleashed by the United States or Israel, was more ef -\nfective because of the U.S. advantage in conventional and nuclear military\ncapabilities. The dynamic would have been far different if instead Iran hadbeen able to counter the Stuxnet attack with aggressive military action.\n57International Security 38:2 64\n57. For a discussion of the politics and technology behind Stuxnet, see Jon Lindsay , \u201cStuxnet and\nthe Limits of Cyber Warfare,\u201d Security Studies , V ol. 22, No. 3 (August 2013), pp. 365\u2013404.\nThe Russian invasion of Georgia/South Ossetia is perhaps the clearest ex -\nample of the kind of combined terrestrial-cyber con\u00baict conceived of here. As\none commentator described it, \u201cThis appears to be the \u00aarst case in history ofa coordinated cyberspace domain attack synchronized with major combatactions in the other war\u00aaghting domains (consisting of Land, Air, Sea, andSpace).\u201d\n58Because they allow for exploitation of the temporary effects of\nsurprise and asymmetry highlighted in other studies of internet warfare,cyberattacks will be most ef\u00aacacious when the conventional military balancealready favors an attacker.\n59\nAn open question exists in any crisis about how far competitors are willing\nto escalate, but an ability to counter cyberattack with other, more kinetic formsof military violence serves alternately to deter or to facilitate the use ofcybercapabilities, giving those nations with terrestrial military power yet an-other option that, even if available to their opponents, may prove extraordi-narily dangerous to practice. As we see today with U.S. drone attacks andSpecial Operations raids on foreign sovereign territory , the power to do muchmore ensures that an opponent maintains a level of discretion in its response toprovocation. Few can doubt the reaction of the United States, for example, ifPakistan attempted to mount a commando raid in suburban Baltimore, say , toassassinate a local resident. Nations that can physically punish others fortransgressions in any domain, electronic or otherwise, are better able to oper-ate in all domains. Once one distinguishes between simple vulnerability andactual threats, terrestrial capabilities become pivotal in determining who exer -\ncises cyberwar.\nEven if cyberattacks are available to weaker actors, their effectiveness will be\nstymied where these actors lack the ability to prosecute advantages generatedby cyberwar, and where weakness in more traditional modes of diplomatic,economic, or military competition ensure that these actors are exposed tocountermeasures. The intractable nature of vulnerabilities ensures that cyber -\nwar will not fundamentally transform either war or world affairs. Despite\na dependence on high technology , developed countries will \u00aand that theycan better exercise cyberwar as a political tool. Attacks against prosperousWestern powers, if well publicized and the source of considerable anxiety , willturn out to be less consequential.

Still, cyberwar could be used by and against forces\nin the \u00aaeld, a valid and possibly important concern. A common approach toevaluating the implications of new technologies for war and peace involvesthe offense-defense balance. Proponents of offense-defense theory focus onmaterial or, alternately , on cognitive/informational factors that they believewill lead to increased military aggression.\n60Nations or time periods that expe -\nrience or perceive offensive advantages will be associated with more war,\nwhereas the opposite is said to happen when innovations or circumstances fa-vor the defense. There is considerable skepticism about the empirical validityof offense-defense theory , as well as about the ability of researchers to isolatethe factors leading to offense or defense dominance.\n61Even if there were noth-\ning controversial in the application of offense-defense theory , it would still bechallenging to draw conclusions about the impact of cyberwar on the generalappeal of warfare, given that cyberwar is new, and given that cybercapabilitiesare not the only factors in\u00bauencing the offense-defense balance. In evaluatingthe impact of cyberwar, it would be valuable, however, to know whether theinternet systematically favors attackers or defenders.\nRobert Jervis proposed a framework for understanding technology-induced\ninstability that seems well suited to explaining the externalities of cyberwar forInternational Security 38:2 66\n60.

Offense\ndominance implies that states are more likely to prefer attack rather than de -\nfense regardless of the prevailing balance of forces. Weaker states seldom pre -\nvail under any circumstances.\nImagine \u00aarst that cyberwar is defense dominant. This does not seem all that\nlikely , and in fact contradicts the prevailing view in the literature. Still, sup -\npose that information infrastructures are more readily defended than attacked.\nIn such as world, the balance of power would favor those states that couldmost effectively orchestrate military command, communications, logistics, andintelligence through the internet or similar types of networks. Even if thisimagined cyber world is defense dominant, it does not follow that terrestrialcon\u00baict is also defense dominant. The relative immunity of networks to attackcould lead to a reluctance to use conventional force, or it could increase incen-tives to act aggressively , depending on whether secure networks are moreimportant for defenders or attackers. The standard military answer is thatcommand and control are more critical for the offense, as commanders havemore need to directly control their forces in the attack. If so, then perhapscyber defense dominance is actually destabilizing, because it increases the abil-ity to attack and (slightly) decreases the ability of defenders to prevail. Con -\nversely , if, as many contend, cyberspace is offense dominant, then this should\ntend to weaken offensive operations in the physical world, making terrestrialcon\u00baict more defense dominant.\n64\nThis basic conception assumes dichotomous conditions of network vulnera -\nbility that do not re\u00baect actual wartime dynamism. It may take time to disable\nnetworks. If so, then there is a \u00aarst-mover advantage that could prove morecritical than the defense dominance created by the heightened need amongattacking forces for effective command, control, communications, comput -\ners, and intelligence. Advantages may follow from starting early in cyber -\nwar. Striking \u00aarst could also prove valuable if disabling an opponent\u2019s\ninternet reduces the enemy\u2019s ability to retaliate.

This is\nnot to say that cyberattacks will not have an effect, only that they are extremelyunlikely to be strategically decisive. A capability to address cyber threats isuseful, but planning for cyberwarfare must occur within the larger frame -\nwork of recognition that this new domain is evolutionary rather than revolu -\ntionary . There will not be a cyber Pearl Harbor, except possibly when and if a\nforeign power has decided it can stand toe-to-toe with conventional U.S. mili -\ntary power.\ncyberterrorism\nThe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, generated a sense of insecurity inthe Western world: How can governments protect their citizens in an agewhere the enemy is concealed and where an attack may come at any time orplace? The temptation has been both to treat terrorism as an existential threat(because it is frightening) and to assume that the best response is a vigorousdefense. Yet, as I have argued, one of the most effective mechanisms of protec-tion is not to remove capabilities, but to puncture resolve, foremost by ensur-ing adversaries that their objectives will not be realized. A vault does less todeter bank robbers than the presence of countermeasures (die packs, num -\nbered bills) that deny criminals the fruit of their plunder, even when they suc -\ncessfully complete the crime. Terrorism is a marginal business, not because\nairports and diplomats are too well protected or because guns or bombs arehard to come by , but because most people, even if very unhappy , do not be -\nlieve that bombings, hijackings, or assassinations will effect positive change.\nIncapable of achieving their objectives directly , terrorists seek to mobilize fearand to cause overreaction, mechanisms that mobilize the targets of terror to as -\nsist in accomplishing terrorist objectives.\nThe resort to cyberwar by terrorists does not imply that cyberterrorism is an\nimportant threat to national security , any more than the appeal of the lottery tothe poor or \u00aanancially desperate implies that the odds of winning are in -\nversely tied to one\u2019s income. Desperation leads to desperate measures, an indi -\ncation in fact that such measures probably will not succeed. In this sense, the\nrise of cyberterrorism may say more about rigidity and impotence betweenagent and structure than about either in isolation. Cyberterrorism may be rela -\ntively ineffective, not unlike terrorism generally . Nevertheless, terrorists mayInternational Security 38:2 68\nadopt cyberwar even though internet attacks are unlikely to sway national\npolicies or public opinion. The adoption of a particular method of attack byterrorists does not mean that their actions represent a critical threat, any morethan crime and corruption are considered issues of national security . Most so -\ncieties treat the latter activities as distinct from national security , not because\nthey are not important or fail to harm people, but because they do not directlythreaten the state. Unless attackers have the ability to prosecute temporary ad -\nvantages through physical force, it is not clear whether cyberterrorism requires\nan elaborate or concerted national security response.\nTerrorism is a form of compellence. Lacking the ability to impose their will\non others, terrorists rely on the prospect of harm to in\u00bauence a target\u2019s be -\nhavior. Indeed, because their ability to harm is limited, the terrorist relies on\npsychology (fear and uncertainty) to multiply the impact of relatively \u00aanitecapabilities on opposing populations or states. Cyberwar is arguably espe-cially poorly suited to the task of fomenting terror. In particular, in addition tothe problems in credibly threatening cyberattacks that have already been dis-cussed, it is dif\u00aacult to see how internet attacks will be able to instill thequality of fear needed to magnify the terrorist\u2019s actions. How terrifying is acyberattack? No one will be happy when the power goes out or when one\u2019sbank account is locked down, but attacks of this type evoke feelings of anger,frustration, even resignation, not terror. Terrorism relies on generating a partic-ularly visceral emotion (the \u201cterror\u201d in terrorist), one not likely to be effectedthrough the actions of cyberwarriors, at least not directly . The old journalisticadage that \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\u201d implies the need for graphic trauma and luridimagery . The very attributes that make cyberwar appealing in the abstract\u2014the sanitary nature of interaction, the lack of exposure to direct harm, andstrikes from remote locations\u2014all conspire to make cyberterrorism less thanterrifying. White collar terrorists are probably not going to prove any more ef -\nfective, and perhaps may prove less, at shaping hearts and minds than the\ntraditional model.\nThis is even more the case with long-duration, low-intensity con\u00baicts that\nare a key component of both non-Western attempts at resistance and Westernefforts to protect the status quo international order. From the perspective ofthe insurgent, asymmetric warfare has never been about attacking to diminishan opponent\u2019s strengths, but is instead focused on maximizing one\u2019s ownstrengths by targeting enemy weaknesses.\n65Insurgency seeks out kinetic closeThe Myth of Cyberwar 69\n65.

Damaging the technology may draw an enemy into direct contact,but it might also cause that enemy to withdraw and reschedule operations.Mobility dominates every battle\u00aaeld for this very reason. Internet attacks inthe midst of close contact make little sense, as it is here that the comparativeadvantage of cyberwar (distance and asymmetry) is least potent. The ability ofinternet-dependent armies to perform in superior ways on existing dimen -\nsions means that this is generally a process of leveling, not revolution.\ncyber espionage\nBy far the most compelling scenario for the transformation of political con\u00baictthrough the internet, and the one that makes new headlines daily , involves theuse of the internet for espionage. As events such as the disclosure of an enor-mous number of classi\u00aaed documents through WikiLeaks illustrates, it maybecome increasingly dif\u00aacult for states to hide details of their capabilities andplans from individuals, groups, and other nations.\nStates have always sought information about prospective opponents. Suc-\ncessful espionage creates signi\u00aacant advantages, but also challenges. For mostof history , spying was physical. An agent had to enter enemy territory to ob-tain information about the capabilities or intentions of a foreign group orpower. The products of espionage were equally tangible. Spies brought backdocuments, captives, tallies, or other materials designed to inform their mas-ters and demonstrate the veracity of their claims. This made spying risky . Espi -\nonage required an overt act that could itself precipitate war. Evidence of spying\ncould form the casus belli for an attack by a target of espionage against the per -\npetrator. Even if it did not lead directly to a contest, where agents were found,\nand what they were looking for, revealed sensitive information. For these rea -\nsons, counterespionage is itself as much about spying as it is about preventing\nespionage. Of course, captured spies also fared poorly , as international normsoffer none of the protections afforded to conventional combatants.\nThe internet makes it possible for the spy to telecommute.\n66Information can\nbe collected without leaving the territory of the sponsoring state, making itdif\u00aacult to deter or capture cyber spies. A spy\u2019s af\u00aaliation can also be con -\ncealed, so that the target is uncertain whether espionage indicates a prelude to\nwar, threats from speci\u00aac states, speci\u00aac formal national objectives, or evenwhether espionage actually occurred. At the same time, cyber spies face theirown challenges. Indeed, the detection of cyber spies may be easier than con -International Security 38:2 70\n66. Telecommuting and the paperless of\u00aace are two other myths of the internet age. It is possible\nthat telecommuting may be no more successful for spies than for anyone else.\nventional espionage, given computer forensics and the trail left when access -\ning \u00aales.\nOne of the perennial challenges for political decisionmakers in dealing with\nany form of espionage is what to do with the information collected. Acting oncovert knowledge is tempting, but often this will also tip off the target andlead to countermeasures. Even more fundamentally , the challenge to analystsis to interpret the signi\u00aacance of information, not something that the internetmakes easier, particularly given the quantity of materials likely to be involved.Critical facts may even be obscured among masses of trivial details, protectionnot unlike the anonymity provided by mass humanity that shelters most of us,something that is only possible given the mountains of information in theinternet age.\nConversely , the single most dramatic impact of the cyber world on political\ncon\u00baict may well come in the form of transparency . Nations may \u00aand thatthey can no longer sustain jealously guarded secrets. The phenomenon ofclassi\u00aacation that led large portions of government activity underground may\u00aand itself \u201couted,\u201d not by alien spies or terrorists, but by groups devoted to theidea that airing national secrets makes it more dif\u00aacult for governments toconnive against one another, or to scheme against their own people.\nThere is considerable reason to believe that reducing secrecy will led to a de-\ncline in warfare, even if some nations are made worse off in terms of relativepower. The conceit of sovereigns is that secrets can be kept inde\u00aanitely . Thishas never been true. Code breaking in both world wars exposed German andJapanese operational plans to exploitation by the Allied commanders. Similarresults may have shadowed opponents during the Cold War. The problem ofcourse was that espionage that unearthed enemy secrets also had to be kept se -\ncret, because there were advantages to knowing something that an enemy did\nnot know that the opponent knew. Espionage did not reduce the prospect ofwar as much as it affected who was likely to win, because those in the knowwere able to exploit relationships and win contests. Today , nations may \u00aandit increasingly dif\u00aacult to imagine that their secrets are safe, even if they are.In addition to \u201cnonpro\u00aat\u201d espionage that publicly discloses state secrets,the ubiquity and success of \u201cfor pro\u00aat\u201d spying in the internet age must makenations consider the possibility that security is inherently porous. Secretsare not sacrosanct, making it more dif\u00aacult to carry out the conspiracies sooften associated with coercive politics. War will still occur, but surprise inwar will be increasingly dif\u00aacult to achieve, in turn reducing at least partof the motivation behind the use of coercive military force. With fewer sur -\nprises, identifying bargains that competitors prefer to the costly exercise of\nwar becomes easier.The Myth of Cyberwar 71\nConclusion\nIn war, tactics must serve strategy and strategy must serve grand strategy . Stu -\ndents of cyberwar have yet to explain how the internet can host meaningful\npolitical con\u00baict, precisely because it cannot serve the \u00aanal arbiter functionthat has for millennia been the purview of physical violence. The tendencyamong pundits of cyberwar has been to focus on tactics and possibly strategy ,showing that harm is possible without explaining how the harm generated islikely to shape the product of political differences. In the absence of this logicof consequences, the internet becomes an adjunct domain to more traditionalforms of warfare. Cyberwar is an evolving dimension of war and a source ofconcern, but in grand strategic terms, it remains a backwater. A failure to focuson grand strategy is an all-too-familiar by-product of the war on terror, wherethe objective has been to harm and not be harmed, rather than to effect mean-ingful changes to the disposition of world affairs.\nIt would be absurd to infer that there is no role for the internet in twenty-\n\u00aarst-century con\u00baict. The internet will be affected by con\u00baict, just as is the casewith every other domain in which individuals, groups, and societies interact.Indeed, the real message for soldiers and politicians is that cyberwar involvesa broadening of the dimensions of warfare, rather than a narrowing of futurecon\u00baict. In most cases, the internet is not a viable, free-standing venue for thepursuit of national interests. It would be surprising if a country intent on at-tacking another nation failed to carry out preparatory or simultaneous attacksof target\u2019s defense capabilities via the internet. It would be even more surpris -\ning if an aggressor successfully substituted cyberwar for conventional, tangi -\nble forms of con\u00baict. This is the conceit of Nikolai Kuryanovich, former\nmember of the Russian Duma: \u201cIn the very near future, many con\u00baicts will nottake place on the open \u00aaeld of battle, but rather in spaces on the Internet,fought with the aid of information soldiers.\u201d\n67Mr. Kuryanovich continues,\n\u201c[A] small force of hackers is stronger than the multi-thousand force of the cur -\nrent armed forces.\u201d68Surely , a country with thousands of soldiers and hun -\ndreds of hackers would be inclined to use both.\nBy itself cyberwar can achieve neither conquest nor, in most cases, coercion.\nRussian military planners obviously understood this in preparing to invadeInternational Security 38:2 72\n67.

Ibid.\nGeorgia, not just with an army of hackers, but with tanks. Indeed, the tanks\nappear to have done more for Georgian insecurity than anything accom -\nplished by information soldiers. The threat of cyberwar cannot deter or compel\nparticularly effectively either, except possibly in the short term, and only withthe consequence that an attacker will have forfeited the potential to exploit agiven set of vulnerabilities in the future. Cyberwarfare will most often occur asan adjunct to conventional warfare, or as a stop-gap and largely symbolic ef -\nfort to express dissatisfaction with a foreign opponent. It is best to discuss\ncyberwar in these contexts, not as an independent, or even alternative form ofcon\u00baict, but as an extension of the logic already expressed in combined armsbattle. Because in most cases cyberwar cannot achieve the objectives that havehistorically prompted nations to commit to tangible military violence, \u201ccyber -\nwar\u201d is only warfare in the context of terrestrial forms of interstate threats\nor force.\nEven the most successful forms of cyberwar (such as cyber espionage) do\nnot presage much of a transformation. Just as innovations in artillery andsmall arms made \u00aaghting in close formation untenable, militaries, govern-ments, and societies will adapt. It would be ludicrous to suggest to moderninfantries that the massing of \u00aares would be best achieved if they stayed in for-mation while on the march or in the assault. Contemporary \u00aaeld commandershave become comfortable with the idea that perimeters are partial or tempo-rary , that air-land battle (and naval warfare for a longer time) necessarily in-volves not fronts, but mobility; not frontal attack, but maneuver. Similarconcepts will pervade discussions of cyberwar. Static security is insecurity . Itdoes not follow, however, that being vulnerable means one will be attacked, orthat there is much that can be done to prevent aggression if it is initiated. Secu -\nrity in the modern world, terrestrial and cyber, is a function more of the mo -\ntives of opponents than of the ability to attack. Nations or groups that strike\nthrough the internet in minor ways may be ubiquitous. Those that threatencritical national security goals will be rare if for no other reason than thatcyberwar is not really war in grand strategic terms. In this regard, the nextPearl Harbor is much more likely to occur in Hawaii than in cyberspace.The Myth of Cyberwar 73\nCopyright\nof\nInternational\nSecurity\nis\nthe\nproperty\nof\nMIT\nPress\nand\nits\ncontent\nmay\nnot\nbe\ncopied\nor\nemailed\nto\nmultiple\nsites\nor\nposted\nto\na\nlistserv\nwithout\nthe\ncopyright\nholder's\nexpress\nwritten\npermission.\nHowever,\nusers\nmay\nprint,\ndownload,\nor\nemail\narticles\nfor\nindividual\nuse."
