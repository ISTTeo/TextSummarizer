        "text": "This volume examines analyses how digital transformation disrupts established \npatterns of world politics, moving International Relations (IR) increasingly towards Digital International Relations.\nWe examine technological, agential and ordering processes that explain this \nfundamental change. The contributors trace how digital disruption changes the international world we live in, ranging from security to economics, from human rights advocacy to deep fakes, and from diplomacy to international law. The book makes two sets of contributions. First, it shows that the ongoing digital revolution profoundly changes every major dimension of international politics. Second, focusing on the interplay of technology, agency and order, it provides a framework for explaining these changes. The book also provides a map for adjusting the study of international politics to studying International Relations, making a case for upgrading, augmenting and rewiring the discipline. Theory follows practice in International Relations, but if the discipline wants to be able to meaningfully analyse the present and come up with plausible scenarios for the future, it must not lag too far behind major transformations of the world that it studies. This book facilitates that theoretical journey.\nThis book will be of much interest to students of cyber-politics, politics and \ntechnology, and International Relations.\nCorneliu Bjola is Associate Professor of Diplomatic Studies at the University of \nOxford, UK.\nMarkus Kornprobst is Professor of International Relations at the Vienna School \nof International Studies, Austria.DIGITAL INTERNATIONAL \nRELATIONS\nThe Routledge Studies in Conflict, Technology and Security  series aims to publish \nchallenging studies that map the terrain of technology and security from a range of \ndisciplinary perspectives, offering critical perspectives on the issues that concern publics, business and policymakers in a time of rapid and disruptive technological change.\nEmerging Technologies and International Security\nMachines, the State and WarEdited by Reuben Steff, Joe Burton and Simona R.

Paraphras -\ning Gramsci, we see the widespread perception of systemic crisis that digital tech -\nnologies have induced in international politics in the past two decades as a potential \nmoment of rejuvenation: the old international relations is dying, the new digital international relations is yet to be born, while the interregnum lacks the proper conceptual vocabulary to make itself understood. This book seeks to bridge this knowledge gap.\nThus far, the discipline of International Relations has been slow to address \ndigital international relations. The field, for the most part, continues its long-standing neglect of studying how technological aspects of international relations are interwoven with political ones (Fritsch, 2011; Ruggie, 1983). For sure, in recent years, highly insightful research on various aspects of digital international relations has been published, some within and much more outside the discipline. \nWe find, for example, ever more detailed studies on cybersecurity (Eriksson  & \nGiacomello, 2007; Gomez  & Whyte, 2021; Harknett  & Smeets, 2022; Kello, \n2013, 2017; Valeriano  & Maness, 2018) and digital economics (Bebia, 2022; Car -\nmel & Paul Regine, 2022; Liu, 2022; Raskin  & David, 2018; Welfens  & Weske, \n2007). A  number of approaches explore how particular kinds of digital interna -\ntional communication are put to use, ranging from manipulation (Bantimaroudis, \nSideri, Ballas, Panagiotidis,  & Ziogas, 2020; Culloty  & Suiter Jane, 2021; Gerrits, \n2018; Karpf, 2017) via changes in diplomatic communication (Adler-Nissen  & \nDrieschova, 2019; Barber\u00e1  & Zeitzoff, 2018; Bjola  & Holmes, 2015, Bjola  & \nManor, 2023; Jackson, 2019) to transnational advocacy and emancipatory poten -\ntials (Baer, 2016; Keller, Mendes,  & Ringrose, 2018; Yin  & Sun Yu, 2021). What INTRODUCING DIGITAL \nINTERNATIONAL RELATIONS\nTechnology, Agency and Order\nMarkus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\n2 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\nis missing, however, is a better grasp of the bigger picture. Our discipline is reluc -\ntant to study the transformation from analogue to digital international relations \nmore comprehensively.\nSuch a \u2018bird\u2019s eye view\u2019 is highly warranted. While paralleling elements per -\ntaining to past waves of technological development up to a point (Drezner, 2019), the current digital transformation raises a series of novel theoretical and empirical questions about global affairs that require a broader overview of how key processes hang together. Technological leaps can have tremendous implications for world politics, for better or for worse. Without the Industrial Revolution, for example, there could have been no colonisation at scale because there would have been no hard limit to a non-industrial economy\u2019s appetite for raw materials, and no total war without cheap steel and precision manufacturing (Drum, 2018). Performing a similarly systemic evaluation for the digital revolution is an arduous exercise. This is partly because we still lack adequate conceptual tools and methods for bench -\nmarking the scope and depth of digital transformation in international relations and partly because, in the grand scheme of things, the technological revolution may just have started. Yet, we do have already enough \u2018digital crumbles\u2019 to start articulat -\ning an ambitious and coherent theoretical frame for studying digital international relations.\nWe define digital international relations as the disruptive interplay of digital \ntechnologies and power structures in global politics responsible for altering onto-logical foundations of agency, shaping hybrid patterns of conflict and cooperation, and streaming the formation of new international political orders. This definition moves beyond narrow interpretations of digital international relations as a form of \u2018digitisation\u2019, involving the technical conversion of analogous entities (e.g. states, IOs, NGOs) and mechanisms (e.g. diplomacy, balance of power) into a digital for -\nmat. It instead suggests that something qualitatively different takes place in the digital age in which the \u2018old\u2019 international relations are thoroughly transformed by digital technologies and that new international phenomena (e.g. hybrid entities, relations and orders) emerge as a result of digital disruption.\nThe introduction develops a digital disruption map that is meant to provide \nresearchers, employing different angles, with guidance on how to put under scru-tiny different processes contributing to the transformation of digital international affairs and how they hang together. Building upon research on digital transforma -\ntions, mainly in disciplines other than International Relations (Hocking, Melis -\nsen & Hofmeister, 2016; Naimi-Sadigh, Tayebeh  & Mohammad, 2022; Schmidt  & \nCohen, 2010; Vives, 2019), we view digital disruption as prompting a fundamen-tal alteration of agential and ordering processes within global politics. The term \u2018disrupt\u2019 originates from the Latin words \u2018dis\u2019 meaning \u2018doing away with\u2019 and \u2018rumpere\u2019 meaning \u2018break\u2019 or \u2018burst\u2019. While it refers to replacing old systems with new ones, disruption ultimately depends on human agency. The new systems may bring about progress such as political emancipation and economic development, \nIntroducing Digital International Relations  3\nbut they may also result in exploitation and inequality. Figuratively speaking, \u2018dis -\nrumpere\u2019 means to pave the way. The digital disruption map we propose in this \nchapter is meant to help researchers study how the digital finds its way into inter -\nnational relations and how this transforms international relations.\nFor heuristic purposes, the map distinguishes technological, agential and order -\ning processes. When it comes to identifying these processes, we cast our net widely in order to arrive at a \u2018big picture\u2019 that transcends the usual dividing lines among perspectives, approaches and research foci in International Relations and helps International Relations scholars to engage with debates in other disciplines. We study three major technological sources of digital disruption (datafication, speed and pervasiveness), examine three broad agential mechanisms (forcing, enticing and winning over) and investigate two ordering layers (foreground and background).\n1 The digital disruption map links these processes together, placing \nthe agential ones at the centre. While technological processes exert pressure on agential processes to digitally disrupt the usual ways of doing things, there is no automatism. Agents succumb to these pressures to varying degrees and in differ -\nent ways. Some of these more fluid digital doings come to \u2018cut new digital lanes\u2019 into the temporarily more fixed ordering processes. These agential and ordering processes, in turn, feed back to the technological ones, adding to the sources of digital disruption and so on.\nThis introduction is organised into seven sections. First, we discuss our  \n(meta-)theoretical building blocks. Second, we inquire into how technological processes digitally disrupt international relations as we have come to know them. Third, we discuss how these technological processes make it into agential pro-cesses. Fourth, we move on to examine how digitally disrupted agential processes leave a mark on ordering processes. Fifth, we address feedback mechanisms from agential and ordering processes to technological ones. Sixth, we preview the book chapters. Finally, our conclusion briefly summarises our argument.\n(Meta-)theoretical Building Blocks\nThis section discusses the meta-theoretical premises of our digital disruption map and identifies its key conceptual components: technological, agential and ordering processes.\nDeep ontological divides cut through much of the Social Sciences (Lohse, \n2017; Schatzki, 2003; Sewell, 1992) in general and International Relations (Jackson, 2008; Smith, 2021) in particular. Most notably, while some authors assume that material forces are ontologically prior to intersubjective ones, oth -\ners presume the reverse. Whereas some researchers put agency ahead of struc -\nture, others do the opposite. This risks, as Lohse (2017, p.  18) puts it, for overly \nnarrow meta-theoretical assumptions to \u2018determine\u2019 theory. This is especially unwarranted in a, comparatively speaking, new field of study such as digital \n4 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\ninternational relations. Embracing a pragmatist epistemology, we seek to be \nontologically more \u2018flexible\u2019 than that, aiming for \u2018horizons of conceptual pos -\nsibilities\u2019 (Pratt, 2016, p.  523).\nResearching digital international relations raises all kinds of questions about \nmateriality and intersubjectivity as well as structure and agency \u2013 and a range of related questions \u2013 that should be addressed through empirical research rather than meta-theoretical assumptions, and we should remain open to the possibility that even then it is often up to constellations of actors and their doings in a concrete encounter how ontological objects relate or do not relate to one another (Bryant, \n2011, p.  265; DeLanda, 2013, p.  47). How do what kinds of digital technologies \nmake actors depart from their established ways of doing things and what kinds of actors, embedded in what kinds of contexts, more so than others? How do new ways of doing things sediment into the repertoire of actors and how do they reach into the making of new digital technologies?\nThe digital disruption map is meant not to make important questions disappear \nbehind ontological blinders. At the same time, it is to provide a heuristic that facili -\ntates research and debate about digital international relations. Thus, we identify three conceptual building blocks that transgress ontological divides: technologi -\ncal processes, agential processes and ordering processes. We perceive these build-ing blocks as essential for understanding how the process of digital disruption is reconfiguring and remoulding power structures within global politics, as well as facilitating the transition to digital international relations. Technological processes are material, while agential and ordering processes may feature material and inter -\nsubjective forces. Furthermore, we cast our net widely when it comes to the range of agential and ordering processes we investigate into.\nIn the spirit of \u2018analytical eclecticism\u2019 (Katzenstein  & Sil, 2008), we investigate \nthree broad conceptualisations of agential processes: forcing, enticing and win-ning over. Most research in International Relations converges on a variant of one of these mechanisms. To briefly illustrate, forcing features prominently in Realist accounts (Mearsheimer, 2021; Morgenthau, 1948; Schweller, 2006; Waltz, 1979) \nbut also in others, for example, rhetoric-inspired research (Krebs  & Jackson, 2007; \nMattern, 2005). Liberals write a lot about incentives (Friedman  & Rapp-Hooper, \n2018; Keohane, 1986; Snidal, 1985) but so do others, for example, critical scholar -\nship on how incentives drive exploitation (Le Billon  & Spiegel, 2021; Mezzadri, \n2016; Williams  & Lee, 2009). W inning over may be the broadest category of \nthem all, including research on advocacy (Carpenter, 2007; Finnemore  & Sikkink, \n1998), argumentation (Bjola  & Kornprobst, 2010; Risse, 2000), public justifica-\ntion (Abulof  & Kornprobst, 2017; Wong, 2022) and performativity (Braun, Schin -\ndler, & Wille, 2019; Hedling  & Bremberg, 2021).\nIn the same spirit, we cast our net widely when it comes to ordering processes. \nFollowing Adler (2019), we distinguish foreground and background. Foreground ordering is about designed institutions, studied, for example, by neoliberal insti -\ntutionalism (Colgan, Keohane,  & Van de Graaf, 2012; Keohane, 2001) and \nregime theory (Green, 2022; Krasner, 1982). Background ordering is about doxic \nIntroducing Digital International Relations  5\n(Adler-Nissen, 2016; Neumann, 2002; Pouliot, 2008), epistemic (Adler  & Haas, \n1992; Danso  & Aning, 2022; Doty, 1993; Ruggie, 1993), ideological (Destradi  & \nPlagemann, 2019; Huo  & Parmar, 2020; Steger, 2008) or hand-on knowledge \n(Adler, 2019; Qin  & Nordin, 2019; Sondarjee, 2021) and practices that enact these. \nThe concept of \u2018background\u2019 was coined by Searle (1980), who referred to it as \nthe usually invisible context that makes intelligible communication possible by implicitly filling in the blanks that explicit aspects of a communicative encounter do not articulate.\nFigure  0.1 previews the map for tracing the evolution of digital international \nrelations, which we will develop in the remainder of this introduction. Sources of digital disruption do not automatically change international relations. Depending on the doings of agents, they find their way into their interaction in more fleeting ways (agential processes only) or more sustainable ones (also ordering processes), and all of this, in turn, has repercussions for technological processes.\nThe following three sections provide a more detailed account of the technologi -\ncal, agential and ordering processes, respectively.\nTechnological Processes\nThis section, drawing from contributions to the literature across the social science and natural science divide, identifies three major technological sources of digital disruption: datafication of social relations, speed of digital-technological progress and pervasiveness of digital technologies in our everyday lives.\nBig Data, the \u2018bloodstream\u2019 of the digital revolution, has become the most \nvaluable commodity of our age, the \u2018new oil\u2019 to fuel the next stage of economic development (Nolin, 2019). According to recent statistics, 60% of the world\u2019s \nFIGURE 0.1  Digital disruption map.\n(Authors\u2019 creation)\n6 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\npopulation has internet access and generates an average of 1.7 MB of data per \nsecond. In 2021, the total amount of data produced by digital users reached 74 zettabytes (one ZB is the equivalent of one trillion GBs). This number is pro -\njected to increase to 149 zettabytes by 2024 (Finances online, 2021). While data constitutes the digital disruption\u2019s \u2018raw material\u2019, it is the companion process of \u2018datafication\u2019\n (Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger  & Cukier , 2013; Mejias  & Couldry , 2019) that \nis responsible for value creation by tracking, aggregating and analysing the under -\nlying information and data points that the \u2018raw material\u2019 offers (Lomborg, Den -\ncik, & Moe, 2020). Through datafication, the informational aspect of a resource \nis \u2018liquefied\u2019 and separated from its use in the physical world, subjected to algo -\nrithmic treatment and machine-learning calibration by which relevant patterns, trends and relationships are identified, and then \u2018re-bundled\u2019 and mobilised via data visualisation methods to generate new analytical insights and representations of the world (Lycett, 2013).\nOne important implication of this process is that information, and the datafica -\ntion techniques developed for processing it, are increasingly treated as a strategic resource, which in turn facilitates the rise of a new era of information geopoli -\ntics (Rosenbach  & Mansted, 2019). The ability of state and non-state actors to \ndeploy datafication methods to understand, predict and generate events of strategic relevance thus becomes as valuable as their \u2018hard\u2019 material power. At the same time, the growing belief that datafication is a winner-takes-all environment could also see states and their domestic tech industry develop much closer relationships together, a situation which is already evident in China, but also emergent in Europe and to a lesser extent in the United States. Digital protectionism is not inevitable \n(Fan & Gupta, 2018), but efforts to establish and enforce different conceptions \nof \u2018digital sovereignty\u2019 are being already pursued by various international actors \n(Eldem, 2020; McKune  & Ahmed, 2018).\nThe second important source of disruption is the unprecedented speed at which \nnew digital technologies enter the global market and are mass adopted. As a conse -\nquence, processes of data generation and datafication are increasingly expected to take place in real time, making it possible for knowledge to be accessed and expe-rienced instantly. Virilio (2007) has long insisted that the ever-increasing speeds that mould and drive forward the modern society may eventually cause traditional political structures to implode. Given the current pace of technological innovation, \nhis prediction may finally begin to sink in. Rosa (2016, p.  37) captures this tem -\nporal pathology through the concept of social de-synchronisation, which refers to the mismatch between (or within) social spheres that are \u2018speedable\u2019 (i.e. cope well with technological advances and social changes), and those that lack the economic, social and cultural resources necessary to keep up with technological and social acceleration.\nTherein lies both the attraction and the potential for disillusionment with digi -\ntal technologies: on the one hand, digital technologies and data-driven analytics create incentives for institutions and actors to \u2018speed up\u2019 to gain and maintain a \nIntroducing Digital International Relations  7\ncompetitive advantage; it also creates an incentive for those \u2018left behind\u2019 to try to \ncatch up and make sure that technological acceleration does not place them in a situation of structural disadvantage. On the other hand, digital technologies come with the side effect of providing the means for speeding up social systems even fur -\nther, thus triggering a \u2018temporal rebound effect\u2019: the attempt to re-synchronise leads to a new round of escalatory pressures to speed up; this generates, in turn, more \nde-synchronisation (Rosa, 2016, p.  40). Applied to international relations, the rapid \nrate of digital innovation introduces a powerful fault line of de-synchronisation  \nbetween those global systems, actors and processes that can better adapt to the pace of technological disruption and close the temporal gap between opportunities as well as possibilities, and those that fall further behind.\nThe third major source of digital disruption, digital pervasiveness, refers to the \nincreasing ubiquity, embeddedness and dependence of digital technology in all aspects of life from communication and entertainment to economic investment and \npolitical decision-making (Gkeredakis, Lifshitz-Assaf,  & Barrett, 2021; Lakhani  & \nIansiti, 2014; Park, Straubhaar,  & Strover, 2019). Digital pervasiveness is driven \nby the rapid development of new technologies, such as social media, the Inter -\nnet of Things, artificial intelligence, cloud computing and the metaverse, enabling new forms of human behaviour and generating new values, norms, interests and forms of knowledge structuring social interaction in the public and private spheres. Digital technologies can no longer be thus viewed as simple tools assisting humans with their tasks and can be discarded once the job is done. They instead weave themselves into human activities to such an extent that the resulting actions are the product of hybrid entities and doings, containing both human and digital elements, and featuring different degrees of machine autonomy.\n2\nWhereas datafication and speed, as sources of digital disruption, primarily chal-\nlenge international politics at the structural level by transforming information and digital acceleration into critical assets of political, economic and military power at a scale never seen before, pervasiveness has the potential to disrupt the micro -\nfoundations of international relations. As digital technologies gradually become more complex and sophisticated, posthuman agential configurations are bound to become not only more prevalent, but also more influential in shaping the context of \nsocial interactions (Lupton  & Watson, 2020; Tastemirova, Schneider, Kruse, Hein -\nzle, & vom Brocke, 2022). In digital international relations, traditional (anthropo -\ncentric) and posthuman forms of agency are thus expected to compete with one another for hybrid (online and offline) influence.\nOne can depict the extent to which digital technologies are allowed to exer -\ncise posthuman agency on a spectrum, from synthesising data for human analysis \nvia providing data-driven suggestions for human action (Brundage et  al., 2018) to \nautonomously deciding and executing a decision without any human input (Haas  & \nFischer, 2017). Furthermore, algorithms may exert posthuman agency in subtler ways by warping the ways by which humans experience and perceive the world. In recent years, for instance, much ink has been spilled over the corrosive role of social \n8 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\nmedia algorithms in fomenting political polarisation, radicalisation and extremism \nwhich has translated into offline violence from Daesh-inspired \u2018lone wolf\u2019 terrorist attacks, to full-scale ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Rohingya minority in Myan-\nmar in 2017 and to the US Capitol Riot on 6 January  2021.\nThe three sources of digital disruption discussed earlier constitute the permis -\nsive conditions that enable and make disruption possible in international affairs. They are the \u2018physical propensities\u2019, as Karl Popper would argue, that \u2018load the dice\u2019 in a particular direction, and influence future situations without, however, \ndetermining them in a specific way (Popper, 1990, p.  18). What makes them have a \nstronger or weaker disruptive effect on the adjacent political space are the agential and ordering processes that inform and shape how these sources are projected, combined and deployed.\nFrom Technological to Agential Processes\nNo matter which of the agential perspectives is chosen by a scholar, datafication, speed and pervasiveness as identified in the previous section increasingly come to re-constitute agential processes. They profoundly shape and re-shape forcing, enticing and winning over.\nDigital disruption has important repercussions for processes through which \nactors come to (threaten to) use force. Superior datafication capabilities, able to sabotage vital civilian infrastructure and/or military capabilities of another actor, are means that can compel. It is no coincidence, therefore, that cyberwar, cyber conflict and cybersecurity have become very often used terms in recent decades \n(Liebetrau, 2022; Robinson, Jones,  & Janicke, 2015). States \u2013 great powers, mid -\ndle powers and small powers \u2013 invest heavily in digital analytical instruments that can identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the cyber defences of their opponents \n(Kostyuk  & Wayne, 2021). Non-state actors such as terrorist networks can make \nuse of digital capabilities, too (Gross, Canetti,  & Vashdi, 2016; Venkatachary, \nPrasad,  & Samikannu, 2018).\nPublic-private partnerships are also to be taken seriously. Project Maven, also \nknown as the Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Function Team (AWCFT), was estab -\nlished, for instance, by the US Department of Defence (DoD) in partnership with Google and later with the Big Data analytics company Palantir, to \u2018turn enormous volume of data available to DoD into actionable intelligence and insights at speed\u2019 (Deputy Secretary of Defense, 2017). AWCFT is a good example of how digital infusions into agential processes may work. Big Data was recognised by DoD as a possible \u2018game changer\u2019 due to its potential ability to provide the US military with a competitive advantage on the battlefield in terms of real-time actionable data. Datafication was then experimentally used to build an AI-powered counter-terrorism capability, which in turn advanced a novel conception of forcing as a data-driven mechanism of coercive power.\nIntroducing Digital International Relations  9\nIf forcing is about sticks, enticing is about carrots. In this reading, agential pro -\ncesses open up international relations more and more to digital interaction by re-\nconfiguring disincentives and incentives for how to cooperate. This comes in many shapes and forms. Some authors expect ever stronger networks of tech coopera-\ntion among self-interested and like-minded states (Brands  & Edel, 2021; Cohen  & \nRichard, 2020). This kind of cooperation is likely to come at the expense of new barriers. Consider the case of Huawei which has achieved market dominance by outperforming American companies in investing in 5G technology. Its success has prompted the US government to embark on a strategy of \u2018reverse enticing\u2019, which, apart from targeting Huawei directly, also seeks to dis-incentivise US allies from purchasing and integrating Huawei equipment in their domestic telecom infrastruc -\nture (Lee, Han,  & Zhu, 2022).\nAfter being outflanked by China\u2019s active policy to build digital partnerships \nin the Global South, the EU has recently accelerated its technological outreach efforts. The EU\u2019s 2030 Digital Compass emphasises opportunities for further cooperation in the European Union and much beyond, ranging from neighbour -\ning states in Europe to Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Latin America.\n3 Last but \nnot least, a number of authors point out that wherever there are winners, there are also losers. Digitalised health promotion, for example, may serve tech companies and pharmaceutical companies more than patients (Lupton, 2014), transnational social media empires promise great profits for their owners but much less so for the prospects for pluralist media systems and democracy (Dahlberg, 2015; Hardy, 2017), and major tech companies create new \u2018digital subjects\u2019 (Chan -\ndler & Fuchs, 2019).\nWinning over  is about making meaning for others. In our days, attempts to \nwin over others are characterised by novel channels and networks of digital com -\nmunication (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012; Roselle, Miskimmon,  & O\u2019Loughlin, \n2014). These allow governments to pursue a broader yet tailored approach to conducting public diplomacy, international negotiations or crisis communication \n(Bjola  & Manor, 2018; 2022; Duncombe, 2017). At the same time, algorithms \ncan be put to use to distort communication for one\u2019s own ends (Bucher, 2017; Zuboff, 2019) and even to \u2018pierce, penetrate or perforate the political and informa -\ntion environments in the targeted countries\u2019 (Walker  & Ludwig, 2017). The rise \nof echo-chambers, \u2018fake news\u2019, \u2018deep fakes\u2019 and the deliberate weaponisation of information by state and non-state actors has actually reached a point where the \n\u2018dark side\u2019 of digital doings can no longer be overlooked (Bennett  & Livingston, \n2018; Pomerantsev, 2015).\nWhile research, about a decade ago, was rather upbeat about the democratic \nand transparent repercussions of digital communication, more recently, it focuses much more on manipulative techniques. To some extent, this tendency follows what has happened in the world we study. In the early 2010s, there was a con -\nsiderable scholarly interest in social media and the onset of the Arab Spring \n10 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\n(Frangonikolopoulos  & Ioannis, 2012; Markham, 2014; Wolfsfeld, Segev,  & \nSheafer, 2013). In the late 2010s, students of political communication still tried \nto grapple with understanding the election of Donald Trump as US President \nand, more generally, the rise of populist governments worldwide (Boczkowski  & \nPapacharissi, 2018; Enli, 2017; Gerbaudo, 2018; Karpf, 2017; Postill, 2018). Our map cautions against any kind of technological determinism. Agency matters. But the technological possibilities for distorting communication are likely to increase in manifold fashion. The 5G technology is likely to usher into a whole new level of technological disruption, which could introduce a new range of immersive tools of growing relevance for political engagement, such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) platforms.\nFrom Agential to Ordering Processes\nThis section contends that digital disruption does not stop at the level of agential processes. No matter what major IR perspective and approach to world order we employ, digital sources of disruption can sediment via transformations of agential processes into ordering processes. This applies to the foreground and background of the international order.\nDigitally infused agential processes of forcing can reconfigure the foreground\n4 \nof world order, that is, the institutions that actors design to regulate their relations with one another. This is implicit in research of scholars working on cybersecurity, no matter whether they are optimistic or pessimistic about the prospect of new foreground institutions to be built or not. Forsyth and Pope (2014) contend that the costs of an unregulated cyber arms race push great powers into converging on rules and norms about the possession and usage of cyber capabilities. In this reading, new institutions are likely to be designed. More pessimistic scenarios point to the inherent difficulties of arms control and apply these to cyberwarfare, without how-ever denying the possibility of new rules and norms, tailored to cyber capabilities (Mazanec, 2015). Even Harknett and Nye\u2019s caveat  that cyberwarfare makes deter -\nrence obsolete is, in between the lines, an argument about the digital disruption of \nordering processes. A  particular ordering element \u2013 the balance of power \u2013 is no \nlonger viable because of cyberweapons (Harknett  & Nye, 2017).5\nOn the one hand, Segal\u2019s concept of the \u2018hacked world order\u2019 is also an account \nof how the doings of actors, especially great powers, break away from established patterns of behaviour when they put to use new digital technology in their inter -\naction with one another. On the other hand, there are even hints about new back -\nground knowledge being put to use by actors when they try to force one another into a particular behaviour. Their taken-for-granted understandings of how to fight, trade, manoeuvre and manipulate come to increasingly make use of digital technol -\nogy, thus transforming the patterns of their interaction (Segal, 2016). Kello (2021, \npp. 9\u201310), too, writes about what we refer to as background when he describes \nsomething akin to an order of \u2018unpeace\u2019, a new pattern of \u2018harmful action whose \nIntroducing Digital International Relations  11\nmagnitude of physical harm does not rise to the level of war, and whose instruments \ntherefore do not apply, even as it breaches the acceptable bounds of peacetime competition\u2019. Digitally infused ways of pursuing incentives may also sediment into ordering processes. The United Nations, approaching what we referred to as digital disruption as an opportunity for more equality in the world, has launched many initiatives and fora, including the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, the Internet Governance Forum, the EQUALS partnership to coun -\nter the digital gender gap, the UN Innovation Network, the Task Force on Digital Financing of the SDGs and Tech Against Terrorism. There are also more ambi -\ntious documents, including the High-Level Panel Report on Digital Cooperation, entitled \u2018The Age of Digital Interdependence\u2019 and the corresponding Report of the Secretary-General \u2018Road Map for Digital Cooperation\u2019, although it remains to be seen to what extent these will end up ordering world politics. These initiatives seek to add foreground institutions, regulating digital transactions.\nFar from these kinds of assumptions of a digital positive sum game, critical \nscholarship chastises the digital divide. Usages of this concept come in two major variants. First, there is the argument about access to digital technology, underwrit -\nten by economic inequalities (Cullen, 2001; Rogers, 2001; Soomro, Kale, Curtis, \nAkcaoglu,  & Bernstein, 2020; Van Dijk  & Kenneth, 2003). Second, there are argu -\nments that tie these economic and access inequalities in with social hierarchies \n(Atintande, 2020; Jandri\u0107  & Kuzmani\u0107, 2015; Kamil, 2020). In this interpretation, \nthere is a hierarchical background that structures opportunities arising from digital disruption highly unequally across the globe. There is a linkage between these kinds of argumentation and the reconfiguration of authority discussed later.\nDigitally winning over can also leave a mark on the foreground. Since the \ncorona pandemic, digital platforms have become increasingly salient for prepar -\ning international negotiations and diplomatic summits. They shape communication \nthat designs institutions (Bjola  & Manor, 2022). Recent studies show, for instance, \nthat virtual venues affect not only the format but also the substance of international \nnegotiations (Bjola  & Coplen, 2022; Ashbrook  & Zalba, 2021). Yet digital pro -\ncesses of winning over can sediment further into the background. Digital processes of winning over generate new forms of knowledge, rationalities and representa -\ntions of the world. Just as advances in geographically mapping the world in the 16th and 17th centuries made it possible to imagine something like a territori -\nally demarcated state (Ruggie, 1993), today\u2019s networks of actor groupings point towards an episteme that revolves around complex and multiple relations of digital \ninterconnectedness (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012; Hayles, 2016).\nSome time ago, this prompted scholars such as Choucri (2000, p.  256) to write \nabout the \u2018global citizen\u2019 as a possible trajectory of future world politics. More \nrecent scholarly contributions are more sobering in nature (Hall, 2022; McKay  & \nTenove, 2021). There is not just overcoming intersubjective boundaries, there has also been plenty of building new ones and strengthening existing ones. Transna -\ntional right-wing populist networks, for example, are very much based on Self \n12 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\nversus Other representations of relations, which digitally re-shape not only inter -\nnational but also domestic orders (Engesser, Ernst, Esser,  & B\u00fcchel, 2017; Geva  & \nSantos, 2021), ranging from Brazil to the United Kingdom and India to the United \nStates, and the evolving domestic orders feeding back into international order -\ning processes. In extreme cases, digital channels of communication are abused to dehumanise the enemy, for example, the Rohingya in Myanmar (Cosentino, 2020, \npp. 144\u2013122).\nProcesses of winning over, usually as a \u2013 unintended but very consequential \u2013 \nside product, generate background knowledge on who is entitled to speak online and who is not. Judging by the available evidence, there are two contradictory trends. Some voices do come to the fore that were previously silenced. Some feminist scholars show, for example, that recent advocacies such as the MeToo movement could not have gained momentum outside cyberspace, especially \nnot in authoritarian states (Tan  & Xu, 2022; Yin  & Yu, 2021). Yet there is also \nresearch dubbing the Tim Berners-Lees, Steve Jobs and Mark Elliot Zuckerbergs \nof this world colonisers of cyberspace (Jandri\u0107  & Kuzmani\u0107, 2020) and caution -\nary tales of small elites dominating online debates even in established democra -\ncies (Kelly, Hindman  & Kazys V arnelis, 2009). In Bourdieu\u2019s language, digital \ndisruption gives rise to a new form of capital, labelled information capital or digital capital. Some actors possess the digital hardware and skills necessary to \nprevail (Ignatow  & Robinson, 2017). V oice, overall, continues to be distributed \nvery unequally, even though there are occasional windows of opportunity for a more inclusive debate.\nFrom Agential and Ordering Processes to Technological \nOnes\u00a0(and So On)\nMany authors listed earlier, most notably realist and liberal but also a fair share of \nconstructivist and critical theories, assume linear causality. Studying digital inter -\nnational relations, however, necessitates taking feedback loops seriously. When -\never agential and ordering processes come to be infused by digital doings, these add to pressures to augment the sources of digital disruption. More digital disrup -\ntion in the technological processes, in turn, puts again more pressure on agential processes, from there on to ordering processes, and so on.\nThere are two pathways through which international relations comes to add to \ndigital technological processes. First, agential processes feed back into the sources of digital disruption. To give a few examples, states using digital technology to coerce or prevent from being coerced look for ever more novel technological ways of doing so. Relations between Russia and Estonia, for example, are characterised by such a pattern, resulting in a small power punching much above its weight in the \ndigital realm (Veebel  & Ploom, 2016). Reaping benefits resulting from advances \nin digital technology, many state and non-state actors seek to digitally advance \nIntroducing Digital International Relations  13\nfurther. This ranges from agricultural production (Liu et  al., 2021) via pandemic \npreparedness (Whitelaw et  al., 2020) to global trade (Ahmed, 2019) and finance \n(Sibanda et  al., 2020). Technologically sophisticated authoritarian governments, \nabove all China\u2019s, push for the invention of technological means to ever tighten \nthe control of the internet, spread their messages, put new tools to use to increase the surveillance of their own population and strengthen their international digital competitiveness (Feldstein, 2019; Yu, 2020).\nSecond, ordering processes channel agential processes over and over towards \nputting more pressure on technological processes. A  balance of power system, \nfor example, may appear stable for a while (Lee, 2018) but arms races, add -\ning technological innovation after innovation to existing offensive and defensive military capabilities, are likely to lead to a situation in which one power gains the advantages over its rival(s) (Chin, 2019). This is, so to say, a digital reading of Mearsheimer\u2019s tragedy of great power politics (2001). Ontological security, linked to digital practices, are prone to sustain patterns of moving back and forth \nbetween technological, agential and ordering process (Liebetrau  & Christensen, \n2021; Lupovici, 2022). Debates about the future of the liberal world order need to take the digital dimensions of international relations into account, too. There are different scenarios, but they all have a lot to do with how much ordering processes put pressure on technological ones. Given the global competition for innovative digital technology, Lund and Tyson (2018) see China as the power that gains the most. Due to its technological edge, they claim that the centre of gravity of the global order moves eastward and, therefore, away from the lib -\neral order. An alternate scenario posits the emergence of a more limited liberal world order, comprised of tech-democracies engaged in a competitive dynamic with a digitally authoritarian order. They seize upon the opportunities to deepen cooperation by embarking on digital innovation together and excluding others \n(Cohen  & Richard, 2020). Such a scenario points towards an ever-increasing \nglobal digital divide \u2013 among states but also within them (Chen  & Wellman, \n2004; Heeks, 2021).\nThere are all kinds of plausible future scenarios involving ordering processes \nlinked to agential processes of winning over as well. They, too, point towards adding to the sources of digital disruption. On the one hand, a more deliberately minded order could put pressure on digital innovation in order to make delibera-tion run more smoothly. Digital technology, opening up new communication chan -\nnels, making communicative encounters more transparent, presenting arguments in \nclearer ways, can foster \u2018augmented deliberation\u2019 (Gordon  & Manosevitch, 2011). \nOn the other hand, ordering processes resting on manipulative communication exert pressures to introduce ever more sophisticated technologies to suppress some messages and diffuse others. In a \u2018post-truth world order\u2019 (Cosentino, 2020) or even a \u2018hacked world order\u2019 (Segal, 2016), state and non-state actors rely on tech -\nnological innovation to outmanoeuvre one another.\n6\n14 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\nStudies on digital performing point towards different scenarios for reconfig -\nuring power, authority and even agency itself, thus pushing for more novelty \nin technological processes. When hand-on background knowledge comes to be increasingly digitalised, it may also become increasingly attuned to resort to new technological solutions (Smith, 2018). Over time, we may be headed towards \nalgorithmic kinds of governance (Aradau  & Blanke, 2017), where seeking tech -\nnological solutions to governance problems becomes something akin to second nature to the actors. Hybrid or even digital agency would push this co-evolution of technological and ordering processes into directions that are yet to manifest \nfor us today (\u00c5gerfalk, 2020). A  key feature of hybrid or posthuman agency is \nthat agency will not be located with a singular specific agent. It will be rather rooted in an uneven topography of assemblages, associations and relationships by which humans and technologies combine and co-evolve to make sense of the world (Chandler, 2013).\nChapter Preview\nThe first part of the book, entitled \u2018Re-conceptualizing International Relations\u2019, examines how we need to overhaul our usage of frequently employed concepts such as power, sovereignty and knowledge in order to explore the interplay of tech -\nnological, agential and ordering processes. The second part zooms in on agential processes, putting under scrutiny how they are affected by technological processes, and vice versa. The third part focuses on ordering processes and explores their link -\nages to technological and agential processes.\n7\nThe first part of the book starts with a chapter by Richard Harknett, who rewrites \nrealism for the purpose of studying digital international relations. The key concepts of power, security, structure and interests remain very much in place, but the author amends them in important ways. The fundamental organising principle of cyber -\nspace is technological interconnectedness. This creates a core condition of constant contact among actors and leads to a dynamic of persistent action in the pursuit of security through sustaining initiative in anticipation of exploitation of vulnerabili-ties inherent in the system of network computing. Focusing on state sovereignty, Lucas Kello explores how the emergence of computer technology has challenged states\u2019 customary dominance in core areas of national security. Yet challenges such as the rise of multinational technology firms and non-state threats to state security notwithstanding, he contends that states push back successfully, especially in the security realm. Giampiero Giacomello and Johann Eriksson conclude the first sec -\ntion of the book by analysing how knowledge and power hang together in digital international relations. They contend that technological shifts, the growing salience of the private sector and the rise of what they refer to as \u2018super-individuals\u2019 recon-figure international relations. They put particular emphasis on the latter. Navigat-ing cyberspace requires increasingly specialised knowledge and expertise, and not many actors have these capacities.\nIntroducing Digital International Relations  15\nThe second part of the book turns the spotlight on agential processes. Mar -\ncus Holmes and Nicholas Wheeler elaborate on the conditions under which social \nbonds can be expected to be formed between individuals, including diplomats and leaders. They argue that diplomats and leaders are not wrong to point out the limitations of video conferencing technologies, but they have not articulated the fundamental nature of the problem, which includes a lack of information rich -\nness, the preclusion of serendipitous encounters, and crucially, a reduced ability to exclude outsiders. Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook analyses networked urban diplo -\nmacy. Re-defining paradiplomacy, she submits that major cities networking with one another increasingly harness power around transnational issues in order to pur -\nsue shared interests. Studying three institutionalised networks, C40, Global Parlia -\nment of Mayors and Global Covenant of Mayors, she sketches scenarios for how networked cities and nation-state diplomacy could change patterns of competition and collaboration on an enlarged diplomatic stage and perhaps even contribute to resolving collective action problems. Nina Hall examines advocacy organisations during the COVID crisis, a time when most had to organise themselves digitally. She finds that digital advocacy organisations rarely campaign across borders. Most were focused on national concerns. Overall, this chapter suggests that the internet enables new tactics, strategies and organisational forms but it does not always lead to more transnational advocacy. The state remains a strong focus for activists even in the digital era.\nThe third part focuses on ordering processes. Claudia Aradau discusses the evo -\nlution of the global security order. She contends that security professionals have added the language and methods of computing for the purposes of prediction to other forms of anticipatory knowledge such as pre-emption and prevention, that the dichotomy of individual/mass intersects more and more with self/other dichoto -\nmies, and that we are witnessing a shift from risk societies to targeted societies. These transformations reach deeply into the background of the global security order. Miguel Otero-Iglesias zooms in onto the global economic order. Adapting Susan Strange\u2019s structural power framework to digital international relations, he argues that the interaction between the United States, China and the EU (and to a lesser extent Russia) will be crucial for shaping the structure of the international system and its geopolitical dynamics in the 21st century. Studying contestation in the global climate order, Alena Drieschova contends that social media change the opportunity structure for social movements. This applies to the climate strike movements as much as it does to climate sceptics. Yet the former were significantly more successful in making use of this newly evolving opportunity structure. Vic-toria Baines investigates attempts to build foreground institutions in the nascent global digital order. She contends that there are, on the one hand, significant bar -\nriers such as the transformative power of digital technologies that frustrate efforts towards their regulations. On the other hand, there are also promising new prac -\ntices such as new multi-stakeholder models and new alliances, that may be able to overcome some of these hurdles.\n16 Markus Kornprobst and Corneliu Bjola\nAt the end of the book, the editors summarise the findings of the chapters, com -\npare and assess the interplay of technological, agential and ordering processes, \nand formulate an agenda for further research. The latter makes us move from digital international relations to Digital International Relations (DIR). Digital international relations will re-shape international relations more and more. This means that International Relations (IR), that is, the discipline studying it, has to adapt as well.\nConclusion\nIt is not that International Relations scholars overlook digital aspects of interna -\ntional relations. As reviewed earlier, there is important research on how digitalisa -\ntion affects particular dimensions of international relations such as security and communication. What we as International Relations scholars are still missing, however, is the big picture. What is digital international relations? How does it evolve? How are we to study it?\nDefining digital international relations as the disruptive interplay of digital tech-\nnologies and power structures in global politics leading to changes in agency, con -\nflict patterns and ordering dynamics we proceeded to develop a map for studying digital international relations. The map links technological, agential and ordering processes. It is meant to help scholars study the transformations that sources of digital disruption, via agential or via agential and ordering processes, bring about in global politics. The contributors to this edited volume generate fascinating new insights into how digital international relations evolves, and how technological, agential and ordering processes are involved in this evolution. This will prompt us, towards the end of the book, to tackle the question of what digital interna -\ntional relations means for our discipline of International Relations. We will make a case for Digital International Relations (DIR), that is, upgrading, augmenting and rewiring our field of study. We conceive of this field as a pluri-discipline that is in constant exchange with other disciplines, including across the great divide of the social and natural sciences. If our field is to lay bare the sites, issues and forms of contestation that digital disruption has activated in global politics, it simply cannot continue business as usual.\nNotes\n 1 We borrow the differentiation of agential and ordering processes from Adler (2019) but \ncast our net much more widely when it comes to discussing them. We do not push for par -\nticular conceptualisations of these processes but rather seek to demonstrate that whatever \nmajor International Relations angle researchers put to use, digital international relations matter more and more.\n 2 Putting strong emphasis on how these processes transform agency, Fouad (2022) moves \naway from \u2018anthropocentric\u2019 concepts of agency, making a case for the \u2018agency of syntac -\ntic information\u2019.\n 3 See https://futurium.ec.europa.eu/en/digital-compass .\nIntroducing Digital International Relations  17\n 4 We borrow this distinction between foreground and background again from Adler (2019) \nand, again, interpret these categories more broadly in order to use them as signposts to \ndiscuss the existing literature.\n 5 From this, according to some authors, follows a strategy of \u2018persistent engagement\u2019  \n(Fischerkeller  & Harknett 2019). Those authors contending that building and maintaining \na balance of power are still possible are vigorously opposed to such a strategy (Klimburg, \n2020; Klimburg  & Almeida, 2019).\n 6 Note that in our multifaceted world order, different kinds of pressures, such as \u2018augmented \ndeliberation\u2019 and \u2018post-truth\u2019, can put pressure on technological processes simultaneously.\n 7 The chapters focus on functional fields of world order, including security, economics, \nenvironment and human rights as well as what happens in the interstices or liminal spaces \nthrough which they interconnect (B\u00e1tora  & Hynek, 2014; Coleman, Kornprobst,  & \nSeegers, 2019; DiMaggio  & Powell, 1983).\nReferences\nAbulof, U.,  & Kornprobst, M.

More specifically, how can realist analy -\nsis that has focused on the segmentation of state power through an emphasis on \n(securing) territoriality explain the dynamics that flow in and through cyberspace \u2013  \nan environment that rests on interconnectedness? It is this structural feature of \ninterconnectedness, which creates a condition of constant contact (the opposite \nof territorial segmentation and episodic contact) that is critical to understanding \ncyberspace from an international security perspective. In the introductory chapter, \nBjola and Kornprobst correctly see datafication as a source of disruption. It is the \ntheoretical analysis of this chapter that what makes datafication pervasive, how -\never, is the interconnected nature of network computing. It is the structural feature \nof interconnectedness that foundationally supports Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s three \nsources of digital disruption identified \u2013 datafication, speed and pervasiveness \u2013 \nand enables the agential process of forcing and the institutional foregrounding they \ndiscuss.\nTo address the core question, of how realist assumptions can help illuminate \nglobal digital dynamics, the following analysis borrows, builds and broadens off  \nrealist logic to provide a new theoretical understanding of core global dynamics in \nthe digital IR environ.\nThis chapter argues that a structuralist approach to theorising rooted in the core \nrealist concepts of the distribution of power and anarchy can be applied to under -\nstand global politics in its current digital context. However, the realist-based struc -\nturalism offered in this chapter differs significantly from the established theories 1\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF POWER, \nSECURITY AND INTERCONNECTEDNESS\nThe Structure of Digital International Relations\nRichard J. Harknett\n\n30 Richard J. Harknett\nof offensive and defensive realism associated principally with John Mearsheimer \n(2001 ) and Kenneth Waltz (1979 ), respectively, and is anchored on the notion that \ninternational relations is primarily a struggle over autonomy, rather than power.1 \nThe chapter then turns to understanding cyberspace2 through this structuralist lens \nand argues that cyberspace\u2019s unique features function as an intervening layer \u2013 a \nlattice \u2013 that cannot be disentangled from the overall distribution of power and \ninduces its own structural imperative in the way units must pursue their funda -\nmental interest in relative autonomy. The chapter concludes with an analysis of \nhow the overall distribution of power, which tends towards stability currently, \nmaybe undermined by an intense digital-enabled competition, which the strate -\ngic environment of cyberspace is influencing and driving. In realist structuralist \nterms, cyberspace represents a distributed power environment in which tight mar -\ngins of capability to impact other units\u2019 sources of power induce states (among \nothers) to compete intensely. Because this is structurally anchored, we should see \nthis competition sustained. However, it is possible for this intensity to not cross \nover into conflict \u2013 an agreed competition is possible ( Fischerkeller, Goldman,  & \nHarknett, 2022 ).\nThis conclusion is derived from a specific structural rendering of cyberspace \nthat argues that the fundamental organising feature of cyberspace is technologi -\ncal interconnectedness, which creates a core condition of constant contact. In an \ninterconnected environment, states are in constant contact with adversaries, allies, \ndomestic and foreign citizens, and the private sector and business community \n(Fischerkeller  & Harknett, 2020 ; Fischerkeller et  al., 2022 ; Harknett  & Goldman, \n2016 ). From a structuralist perspective, interconnectedness and constant contact \ncombined with the nature of the technology itself lead to an imperative of persis -\ntent action in the pursuit of relative autonomy. This autonomy is sought through \nsustaining initiative in the anticipation of exploitation of vulnerabilities inherent in \nthe system of network computing that has become the backbone of 21st-century \nlocal, national and global interactions. The competition in this space, according to \nthe theory developed here, should be intense for some time to come.\nOn Interconnectedness and Segmentation\nAs the traditional contest over power and security continues within the terrestrial \nspace, it is being influenced and affected, but importantly not replaced, by the stra -\ntegic imperative that derives from cyberspace\u2019s structural features. The global sys -\ntem is both anarchical and now interconnected. This recognition has implications \nnot only for how power is distributed in the current international system, but for \nhow we need to evaluate the distribution of power as a theoretical explanatory \nvariable as well.3\nIf this proposition of interconnectedness and its interaction with anarchy holds, \nthe challenge presented for both our understanding of digital international rela -\ntions and the conduct of it is significant since so much of our pre-digital age \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  31\nunderstanding and conduct of international relations (and its theoretical explana -\ntion) assumes that segmentation, in the form of sovereignty, is fundamental to state \nbehaviour.\nThe basic notion of territoriality \u2013 the set of state policies and organisations \nmeant to deny extension of direct political control or ameliorate indirect political \ninfluence over one\u2019s territory from external forces ( Herz, 1973 ; Hinsley, 1986 ) \u2013 \nrests on the proposition that the dirt underneath our feet can be segmented through \ndrawn lines in the sand (we also segment the air and the sea similarly). Territorial -\nity operationalises sovereignty, which is the construct that drives the international \nlegal system and impacts how every state organises itself internally to protect and \ngrow its sources of national power.\nWhat are we to make of territoriality and sovereignty in an environment of inter -\nconnectedness where securing sources of national power does not rest on resist -\ning forcible violation of territorial boundaries because sources of national power \nare, through global networked computing, now structurally open to non-forcible \nexploitation every second of everyday?\nWhile the prospect of a re-imposition of segmentation exists, in part because \ncyberspace is human-constructed and can be reconstructed on a different organis -\ning feature, this chapter presumes the feature of interconnectedness holds for the \nnext decades. We have plenty of theories that assume segmentation, but what if \nthere truly is a distinct strategic environment of interconnectedness that now must \nbe understood.4 Exploring that challenge through the logic of anarchy, the distri -\nbution of power, and security is the focus of this chapter. Implicit in asking this \nRosenauian \u2018what if\u2019 theoretical question ( Rosenau  & Durfee, 2000 ) is acceptance \nof Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s concept of digital disruption as a starting point.\nOn Structural Thinking\nFrom a structuralist perspective, cyberspace is imposing a layer of strategic condi -\ntions to which states and non-state actors are aligning their security behaviours. \nThey are doing so while still fundamentally reacting to the lack of centralised \nauthority globally (anarchy) within the context of the specific distribution of power \nthat exists. Bjola and Kornprobst have suggested that Digital IR theorising must \ntake the feedback loops of structure and agential and ordering processes seriously \ngiven the disruptive context in which we find ourselves. This requires the addition \nto traditional realist focus on anarchy, power and security the construct of a cyber \nstrategic environment \u2013 understood as an interconnected environment in which \naction can affect the relative distribution of sources of power through a distinctive \nlogic and dynamic of persistent action as it relates to the core objective of securing \nthose sources of power ( Fischerkeller et  al., 2022 ).\nFrom a structural perspective, how capabilities are distributed across an envi -\nronment lacking centralised authority, but also now in constant contact with each \nother due to a technically interconnected system on which political, economic, \n\n32 Richard J. Harknett\nsocial, military and organisational actions take place, should reveal why interna -\ntional relations flows as it does. Such a focus should provide us with an expectation \nabout the key actors within the system and their behaviours. As Hans Morgenthau \n(1993 , p. 7) himself suggested it is what is possible and not what is desirable that \ndrives behaviour.\nIf we accept the Bjola and Kornprobst notion of digital disruption as con -\ntaining both creative and destructive dynamics that can simultaneously produce \nopportunity and vulnerability, realist structural concepts must effectively capture \nthe simultaneity that exists when inherent vulnerability to exploitation creates \na constant opportunity to exploit (a core consequence of cyberspace\u2019s intercon -\nnectedness) and the pursuit of that opportunity reinforces and at times feeds fur -\nther vulnerability.5 The point here is that the reinforcing nature of vulnerability \nand opportunity in cyberspace must be captured in IR theory. Companies con -\ntinually introduce more technical vulnerabilities in pursuit of the opportunity of \ngreater ease of access to data. The two outcomes cannot be separated but rather \nmust be studied as a feedback loop of action. Similarly, states continually pursue \nzero-day exploits to advance opportunity even though the continued existence \nof such exploits can blow back on them, which, for example, occurred with the \nEternal Blue exploit ( Perlroth  & Shane, 2019 ). And yet, states seeking zero-day \nexploitations spend significant time, talent and treasure on dealing with vulner -\nabilities directly and typically seat their cybersecurity policies on dealing with \nthe vulnerability landscape essentially trying to solve the technical problems \nthey are trying to exploit. In the end, the full range of Morgenthau\u2019s \u2018what is \npossible\u2019 must be explored in the simple recognition that much is possible in \ncyberspace.\nThe Structural Imperative of Autonomy and Interconnectedness\nAs argued previously ( Harknett  & Yalcin, 2012 ), a theory of structural autonomy \nrests on an understanding of the interplay  between the distribution of power and \nanarchy. Units act in accordance with both anarchy and the distribution of power. \nThey do not a priori  favour one over the other. Since structure is composed of \nboth an anarchical ordering principle and a shifting distribution of capabilities, \nstructure both shapes agent behaviour and is iteratively modified by that behaviour \nas the distribution of capabilities changes (there is feedback). What vary are the \nstrategies units will pursue in relation to the specific distribution of power they find \nthemselves in. Cyberspace intervenes across this feedback to reinforce a particular \nway (cyber persistence) in which relative autonomy must be pursued if security is \nto be achieved.\nStructure as the overarching conditional environment, at both the anarchic and \ninterconnected levels, reinforces the identities and orientations of the agents in it \nand re-shapes those orientations actively over time. Within the theoretical frame -\nwork of structural autonomy, we can assume that reasoning and responsive actors \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  33\nform their identities, motivations and actions not from a desire that is independent \nfrom the structure but directly because of structural conditioning. They respond to \nthe structural conditions with their available capabilities. We can assume units are \nnot blind calculators with fixed strategies, but reasoning assessors of the structural \ncontext they find themselves within.\nWe can assume that the units within the system of digital international relations \nhold complicated evaluations of the world in which they act and update their imme -\ndiate interests according to where their capabilities place them on the distribution \nof power, globally. They reason and respond to the structural conditions, includ -\ning the interconnected feature of global networked computing. They might have \nspecific desires to attain but in cases where those desires do not fit into the power \ncontext in which they find themselves, we must assume they have the capacity to \nre-evaluate and re-describe their interests.6 We can assume that states, for exam -\nple, can use code through cyber operations to achieve strategic ends ( Harknett  & \nSmeets, 2020 ), but those ends can differ significantly depending on their overall \nplacement in the distribution of power. Theory should be able to capture the fact \nthat North Korea, Russia, China and the United States all use the means of cyber \noperations in different ways. It is a versatility to achieve strategic gains that air -\npower, seapower and nuclear power lack in relative terms.\nThus, in sum, structural autonomy theory suggests that international politics is \ncharacterised by units with organised power (the capacity for sustained action), \nwho are reasoning and responsive to the international structure, which shapes not \nonly behaviours but also motivations of units in an iterative and active realm of \nshifting distributions of power.\nThe units to which we should focus our analytical attention are those that have \nthe material capacity for sustained consequential action internationally. This means \nthat our theories should not be bound to an assumption that units capable of con -\nsequential action relative to sources of modern power need exclusively or primar -\nily remain states. Nor, due to the low entry costs of cyber capabilities, should we \nexclude from analysis states that in the terrestrial world would not be considered \n\u2018great\u2019 or \u2018major\u2019 powers. The condition of constant contact that flows from inter -\nconnectedness and the very nature of the technology itself (the ease at which it is \nmodified through every new software and hardware and processing version) means \nthat technology companies and smaller states understood as units can have con -\nsequential effects. Whether they can, overtime, achieve sustained capacity to act \nglobally (what still distinguishes states over other units) remains an open question \u2013  \nbut theory should not preclude the possible need to explain the behaviour and \neffects of such units. If the algorithm becomes a contested source of power, who \nleads in Artificial Intelligence (AI) development and application globally may mat -\nter significantly in explaining the flows of global relations. Alphabet (the parent \ncompany of Google) may have to be understood as a strategic actor, rather than \nmerely an economic one, if it continues to rival and extend past the capabilities of \nsome states to produce , deploy and control globally  algorithmic decision-making \n\n34 Richard J. Harknett\ncapacity. In 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin accepted this reality noting in \na speech that \u2018Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia, but for all \nhumankind .  . . whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler \nof the world\u2019 ( Vincent, 2017 ). While President Putin may have assumed that the \nleader will be a state, IR theory must be open to a possible non-state interloper from \n\u2018big tech\u2019 given the nature of the technology itself and the capacity held by such \ncompanies.\nAutonomy, Self-Reliance and Interconnectedness\nWhat is the central dynamic that logically follows from the interaction of anarchy, \nthe distribution of power and reasoning and responsive units? In contrast to defen -\nsive and offensive realism, structural autonomy argues that states are not inherently \npreoccupied with power maximisation or security, but rather more fundamentally \nwith seeking autonomy. All that can be derived from a structural imperative about \nunit motivation is that it is not about accumulating a capacity, but rather being \nself-reliant in having the wherewithal to act on that capacity in a sustained and \nsignificant manner . The focus on a wherewithal to act (autonomy) or the inability \nto do so derives from the combined lack of a central authority and the variance of \ncapabilities arrayed across several units (anarchy and the distribution of power). \nThus, structurally derived, it can be assumed that units seek autonomy, which is \ndefined as possession of the wherewithal for the organised capacity to act in a \nsustained fashion. Seeking autonomy should be understood not as a unit-based \nand generated motivation, but rather as a structurally generated necessity. Under -\nstanding autonomy as the basic motivation shifts our understanding of Waltz\u2019s and \nMearsheimer\u2019s focus on security or power maximisation. Those pursuits are differ -\nent strategies (among many others) for achieving the base structural necessity of \nbeing autonomous. Alone, the combination of anarchy and a distribution of power \ncannot a priori  tell us whether states are under threat, and thus concerned about \nsurvival and fixed on how they will go about dealing with their condition. All anar -\nchic structure and distributed capacity can reveal is that we are dealing with a sys -\ntem of relatively autonomous actors. If the system persists, we can derive the fact \nthat at least some of the actors are successfully seeking and achieving autonomy \nrelative to each other.\nThus, structural autonomy offers a substantive modification to Morgenthau\u2019s \ntraditional supposition as noted earlier. Rather than a struggle over power, interna -\ntional politics is best understood, more purely, as a struggle for autonomy .7\nThe concept of autonomy differs from the concepts of power and security as \nmotivations and does not have a link to any defensive or offensive presuppositions. \nIt liberates our analytical ability to assess international politics more broadly. It \ndoes not tell us that states act defensively because of their defensive intentions or \noffensively because of their offensive intentions. Those intentions and the actions \nthat ultimately follow from them are strategic responses to the structural conditions \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  35\nthat units face, not pre-ordained defaults. This logic parallels the operational-level \nlogic dominating the cyber strategic environment. According to cyber persistence \ntheory, there is no offense dominance or offense-defence advantage in cyberspace, \nonly offense-defence fluidity, which contributes to the necessity of finding security \nthrough initiative persistence ( Fischerkeller et  al., 2022 ).\nIn a structural analysis of international politics, there can be no overarching \nunit motivation of survival or search for wealth and power independent of the \ndistribution of power. Units that assess that the international environment presents \nopportunities will not feel threatened, while units who conclude that their position \nin the distribution of power is under threat may be compelled to take defensive \nmeasures.8 Opportunistic or threat-responsive behaviour flows from the structure \nof international politics and cannot be pre-assigned as a dominant motivation. At \nits root, we must assume that units simply want to possess the capacity to act in a \nsustained manner that preserves and enhances their capacity to act into the future  \u2013  \nthey merely want to remain autonomous. Whether that autonomy is threatened \nto the point at which survival is at stake is dependent upon principally where \ntheir capacity rests across the distribution of power. Not all units will find them -\nselves assessing their policy choices set against a backdrop of surviving, which \nimplies a threat to their existence. A  default to a survival-first response follows \nonly from a particularly threatening distribution of power and not all distributions \nof power will threaten every state\u2019s existence to the point that it can be assumed \nthat survival is a base motivation. If we are to offer an explanatory framework \ntruly anchored on structure, then the distribution of power combined with anarchy \nmust matter in an explanatory way; that is, we must assume that it will shape unit \nbehaviour and units must define themselves against those particular and distinc -\ntive distributions; otherwise, the distribution of power is either static (which it is \nnot) or meaningless (which, in a structural realist theory, it cannot be). As we shall \nsee adding the intervening layer of interconnectedness leads to a very particular \nbehaviour that all units must address. A  structural theory salient to digital disrup -\ntion must be alive to all these structurally driven conditions and the behaviours \nthat will flow from them.\nWhat we can observe and deduce is that there exists both a reinforcement of the \nimperative of autonomy due to anarchy and a restriction on pure freedom of action \nimposed by the conditional opportunities and threats embedded in the distribution \nof power and interconnectedness. Idealised, autonomous actors would prefer pure \nfreedom of action and have direct control over their individual destinies, but the ever-\npresent and shifting distribution of power to which they must react is a fundamen -\ntal feature that while constraining that pure freedom also enables its never-ending  \npursuit. At a base level, units\u2019 standing in the international distribution of power \nplays a significant role in defining the strategies of autonomy they will adopt.\nStructural autonomy also assumes it is more accurate to understand the anarchic \norder as a self-reliance  system. Units try to promote their autonomy in such a sys -\ntem by relying on their capabilities to act by adjusting their desires and behaviours \n\n36 Richard J. Harknett\nin accordance with their capabilities relative to others. No specific orientation rules \nunit power, but rather the distribution of unit power rules unit orientation.\nSystems with no central authority force the units to rely on their own capa -\nbilities to take control of their own affairs, which might include both threats and \nopportunities, which due to the interconnectedness of cyberspace are fluidly ever-\npresent at least minimally in the form of simultaneous vulnerability and oppor -\ntunity to exploitation through cyber operations and campaigns. There might be \ndifferent distributions of power imposing different specific ranges of responses on \nunits. By relying on their power, units may act offensively or defensively depend -\ning on the specific conditions they face as they struggle to sustain autonomy. Due \nto the nature of cyberspace, the condition of constant contact drives, at least states \npresently, to persistently anticipate exploitation. In a self-reliance system, threat to \nsurvival is not ever-present, but rather it is both the overall specific distribution of \npower in which units find themselves plus the interconnected strategic environment \nof cyberspace that will structure the choices units must make relying on what they \ncan achieve.\nA self-reliance system follows from, but also reinforces, the anarchical nature \nof the system. This reinforcing dynamic of structure (which is not static) is criti -\ncal to recognise. If anarchy is the organising principle of international politics, \nthen the most primitive state motivation should properly follow its explicit descrip -\ntion. In the literature, there is a traditional common ground in the definition of this \n central concept. It is commonly defined and adopted by realists and non-realists \ntoo, as \u2018the lack of a central authority\u2019 (Milner, 1991). An anarchic system should \nbe defined as a mechanistic society in which units perform the same set of tasks.9 \nStates in the anarchic system of international politics do not delegate fully their \nauthority to legislate, execute and judge to any higher or equal authority because \nthey hold some share of the distribution of power. This is the structural connection \nbetween anarchy and the distribution.\nDefining the international system as anarchic and characterised by the distribu -\ntion of power requires recognising the existence of units who are motivated by the \nstructure to promote their autonomy rather than delegating all or some parts of it to \nsome other authority. This is the minimum condition for a system to be anarchic. \nThis is also the maximum limit for deriving a unit motivation from the equation \nprovided by the definition of an international system as a combination of anarchy \nand a distribution of power.\nAny other unit motivation like seeking survival or maximising power requires \nsome additional properties beyond either the concept of anarchy or the distribu -\ntion of units populating it. For instance, if anarchy was defined as an environment \nfull of opportunities, then one could assume states as opportunity-seeking agents \nor if it was defined as an environment with no opportunity but full of threats then \none could assume a survival motivation. But if it is defined merely as the lack of a \ncentral authority then logically the only available inference for unit motivation is \nthe denial of central authority or, more precisely, the denial of a delegation of the \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  37\nautonomy that sustains the anarchic structure . If we assume an anarchic organis -\ning principle then we must assume that the units capable of relying on their own \ncapabilities, who are sustaining that anarchic order are doing so because they want \nit and can sustain it via their individual self-reliance (and thus even if a unit pur -\nsued transformation to hierarchy the self-reliance of others would constrain the \nattempt). Therefore, logically, the only available inference that can be made from \nthe definition of international structure as anarchic is the existence of units structur -\nally driven to promote their autonomy by the presence of a distribution of power in \nwhich self-reliance is possible. There is a reason for the reinforcement and mainte -\nnance of anarchy, and it is the unit fundamental motivation to remain autonomous. \nIf any unit in the system was powerful enough to turn it into hierarchy or all units \nwere helplessly in need of survival, there would be no anarchic system.\nThe maintenance of autonomy, not its delegation, is the structurally derived rule \nof international politics.11 There is a central cause of anarchy and that is the pres -\nence of a distribution of power in which self-reliance is possible.12 While absolute \nautonomy is an elusive goal, relative autonomy is the defining characteristic of \ninternational politics.13\nThe Shaping Effect of the Power Environment\nAssuming self-reliance in the pursuit of autonomy, structural autonomy theory \norients its explanatory focus around two archetypes of power environments that \nallow for shifts and, in combination with the fundamental motivation of seeking \nautonomy, produces different incentives, behaviours and systemic outcomes. The \nframework identifies two base-level forms of systemic power: a distributed power \nenvironment and a concentrated power environment. While the base motivation is \nto seek autonomy, how units go about doing that will depend on whether they find TABLE 1.1  Adding the Digital to International Relations Theory10\nTheory Ordering  System  Fundamental Unit Orientation  \nPrinciple  Dynamic Motivation (The default \n(Structure) behaviour following \nfrom the fundamental \nmotivation)\nDefensive Realism Anarchic Self-help Survival Security-maximisation\nOffensive Realism Anarchic Self-help Survival Power-maximisation\nNeoliberal  Anarchic Self-help Absolute Wealth-maximisation\nInstitutionalism well-being\nDigital Structural Anarchic +  Self- Autonomy Status quo or change \nautonomy distributed  reliance which depends on \ncapacity +  the concentrated or \ninterconnectedness diffused distribu -\ntion of power\n\n38 Richard J. Harknett\nthemselves within one of these two environments and where individually they find \nthemselves in the relative distribution of power spread across either environment. \nThe next section describes these two base power environments first and then turns \nto adding to the explanatory framework the intervening lattice of cyberspace.\nThe Diffused Power Environment\nIn a diffused power environment, relative power is spread across several units with \nmarginal differences among some set of core actors. For a diffused power environ -\nment to exist, a small gap in power must subsist between a minimum of two units \nand can encompass many more. What have traditionally been called bipolar and \nmultipolar systems have more in common than offensive and defensive realists \nhave considered and are better explained under the single category of a diffused \npower structure. Within such a diffused power environment, there is an incentive \nto seek change in relative power positions and in the overall distribution of power \nitself. Since gaps are small, advances in material capacity will affect autonomy \nmore directly (and potentially more immediately). Opportunities and potential \nthreats will be scrutinised to see if positive change can be advanced, or negative \nchange can be avoided. One characteristic of such diffused power environments is \nthat this behavioural orientation towards change will tend to lean the overall system \ntowards conflict \u2013 the propensity for major war is higher in diffused power envi -\nronments. This outcome tendency holds even if states within the distributed power \nenvironment frame their behaviour and intentions as being primarily defensive.\nBecause of tighter gaps in relative power in a diffused power environment more \nand more units can act in accordance with their individual goals and strategies. \nImportantly, the increased capability of each actor does not mean that they become \nmore autonomous; if in a diffused power environment, others are increasing their \npower as well. Under such conditions, units become more and more concerned \nwith structural constraints. It becomes an undesirable environment because of the \ndecreased level of autonomy for all. Additionally, since small changes in gaps in \npower may impact the position of a unit in the diffused environment, units will \nnot favour the status quo and if the possibility arises, their default orientation is to \ntransform the system, or minimally to somehow shift where they sit within a tight \nor tightening distribution of power. The combination of a macro-level orientation \nto get out from under a tight diffused power environment and gain more auton -\nomy and actual change-oriented decision-making will structurally orient  overall \nglobal politics towards the potential for intensified competition or conflict. It is \nnot the polarity of the system as structural construct, nor the defensive or offensive \nunit proclivity (a unit-level assumption) that offers us the best explanatory basis. \nRather, it is the recognition that power is diffused across two or more units and that \nthe distribution of power creates both opportunities and constraints to autonomy. \nThe structural potential for major war exists in distributed power environments \nand we can hypothesise that the more immediate cause of when such major conflict \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  39\noccurs relates to the tightening of the shares of power held by units across that dis -\ntributed environment, whether the distribution is between 2, 3, 4, or a dozen units.14\nConcentrated Power Environments\nThe alternative to a diffused power environment is present when there are large \ngaps in power between units, creating a concentrated power structure around a \nsingle unit.15 Globally, this would exist when one unit achieved a power differential \nwith all other units in the system. Historically, this power environment has emerged \nregionally, rather than globally, although much attention has been directed to the \nnotion of unipolarity in the post-Cold War.\nIn concentrated power environments, units in search of an increased level of \nautonomy tend to prioritise retention of the power structure (and their place in it) \nover change.16 This holds for both sorts of actors that exist in concentrated power \nenvironment. Intuitively, the most powerful actor who has concentrated most of the \nmaterial capabilities across the system would favour retaining such a power envi -\nronment and thus their place in that distribution as the leading unit. However, this \norientation towards retaining the environment holds for secondary units as well. \nSuch actors, because of their inability to challenge directly the status quo must \ncontent themselves with maintaining their autonomy within what is possible, rather \nthan desiring an unmanageable pursuit of systemic transformation, which could \nrisk their autonomy due to the concentrated nature of the power structure. Here, it \nis the gap in power that prioritises retaining the status quo over seeking change . It \nis also the gap in power that structurally orients the overall system to limited con -\nflicts (\u2018limited\u2019 here means non-systemic, while war itself might be intense among \nits protagonists it does not threaten the stability of the overall system).\nImportantly, this tendency towards minor conflict holds even if states engage \nin behaviours that are framed as offensive. The leading state\u2019s uses of force in a \nconcentrated power system will, by structural definition, tend to be limited in scope \nand directed to specific instances in which such use is necessary (or perceived to be \nnecessary) to retain the status quo overall. The leading state will have a limited pre -\nventive orientation or limited power adjusting objective behind their use of force \nthat will not tend to push the overall system towards global war. This offers a better \nexplanatory frame for examining US policy since the 1990s, for example.\nSecondary states may also act offensively or opportunistically to increase their \nlevel of autonomy. They do not defensively balance the would-be hegemon because \nof the possible risks of doing so but they also do not jump on its bandwagon because \nthat would harm their level of autonomy. Instead, structural autonomy expects \nthat such units will employ clever and nuanced policies of increasing their level \nof autonomy without directly challenging the overall concentrated nature of the \npower distribution. Intriguingly, the emergence of cyberspace has created within a \nrelative concentrated global power environment a strategic (sub-)environment that \naligns to the logic of a tight diffused power system.\n\n40 Richard J. Harknett\nThe Lattice of Cyberspace\nOver the course of human history, technological shifts have served as intervening \nvariables in the overall arrangement of distributions of power. Those units that \ncould anticipate and harness the emergent technology found their relative position \nchange positively. For most of human history, these technological moments have \nreset strategic environments ranging from those that are defensively advantaged \n(think, the First World War) to offensively advantaged (think, 1990\u201391 Gulf War). \nOnly recently in human history, however, have we faced a technological disruption \nthat fundamentally altered the way one had to think about security strategically (for \npurposes of analysis, \u2018strategic\u2019 is understood to mean an environment in which \nsources of national power can be altered through adversarial action). In 1945, the \ndestructive capability leap achieved in the atomic bomb enabling one plane with \none bomb to destroy one city challenged millennia-long thinking about security. \nWhether armed with spear, moat, horse or tank, the conventional strategic environ -\nment was one defined by the capacity to secure oneself through one\u2019s own actions \nand capabilities. At any given time, the conventional strategic environment might \nbe technologically shaped towards advantages of one type of technical, tactical \nand operational combination (offense vs. defence), but security primarily rested \nin one\u2019s own hands \u2013 autonomy necessitated some rudimentary capacity to secure \nand success in security essentially went to those that adapted to the advantages \nof the environment more effectively (in terms of applied scale, scope and speed). \nThe same held on the opportunity side of increasing material power through the \nsame means. The advent of the atomic bomb reset the core security question to \na fundamentally different equation: how do I  secure when I cannot defend? The \nnuclear strategic environment shifted to one of offense dominance, and thus secu -\nrity rested on convincing the other side not to attack in the first place. Deterrence \nbecame the response to this strategic environment and possession of or pursuit of \nnuclear weapons became a significant factor in how the distribution of power over -\nall played out and continues to play out internationally since 1945 ( Fischerkeller \net al., 2022 ).\nFor the development of theory purposes, this chapter assumes that cyberspace \nrepresents another deep technological disruption (not simply a shift) and aligns \nwith Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s notion that this digital disruption is both immensely \ncreative and potentially destructive, simultaneously. Its impact on securing sources \nof power is so profound that we must consider the existence of a third strategic \nenvironment of contemporary international relations with its own primary logic. \nIt does not displace the nuclear or conventional environments, but rather forms a \nlattice structure that supports inclusive activity (in cyberspace) and cross-domain \nactivity (through cyberspace) that is distinct in its structurally induced dynamics.\nSpecifically, cyberspace at its technological core has created an interconnected \nenvironment in which the sources of national power \u2013 economic, military, political-\ncultural, informational and natural are exposed to direct and indirect interaction \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  41\nand exploitation. This interconnectedness can lead to benign and positive outcomes \nas well as malignant and negative outcomes. In this sense, it can be understood as \nan organising feature of a sub-structure within international relations that creates \nits own conditionality \u2013 specifically the condition of constant contact. This is dif -\nferent than in the terrestrial world in which contact with someone else\u2019s sources \nof national power (and their contact with yours) might be understood as episodic, \nlatent or potential. The most direct instance of contact is during times of war when \ncross-border incursion can destroy, disrupt and dislocate sources of national power. \nWhen the condition of war subsides, the contact does as well, back, primarily, to \na condition of latent or potential contact. To be interconnected, however, is to be \nin constant contact, which translates into an expectation that somewhere someone \nglobally has access to some aspect of your national power to a degree that direct \nalteration is possible  \u2013 and given the nature of the technology itself, such altera -\ntion may not be noticed immediately. This interconnectedness means that strategic \nbehaviour of states cannot be segmented from economic actors, allies and indi -\nviduals, but must anticipate all of these interactions. This is due to the technology \nitself in combination with the structure of interconnectedness and constant contact \n(Fischerkeller et  al., 2022 ).\nPart of the nature of networked computing technology and the digital interfaces \nused to access it is that core computer code serves simultaneously as the terrain of \nthe space and the means by which one traverses the terrain. So, a change in the one \nchanges the other. A  change in software to achieve a new function creates a new \ndigital space for that function, which then typically compounds further change in \nprocessing that links to hardware and thus requires change in the hardware itself \novertime, which iteratively requires software updates to occur.\nAssessed in terms of seeking autonomy, it means that you can protect or \nadvance your national sources of power (this is not an offense-dominant environ -\nment), but you can only confidently protect or advance in the moment of a specific \nconfiguration of software-hardware and the processing that links them; and that \nmoment is relatively fleeting. It means that you must assume that someone has the \nopportunity to change conditions such that they advance further opportunities to \nenhance their capacity to act \u2013 their autonomy. This global technological space is \never evolving and importantly, the means to move and construct can be refined, \nre-purposed and reused at a scale, scope and speed that is stra tegically significant. \nIn line with Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s expectations, the sources of digital disruption \nare generating a fluidity in opportunity and vulnerability that is sustained and glob -\nally salient.\nSo, what does the combination of interconnectedness, constant contact and an \never-evolving means and terrain amount to strategically? In a phrase, relative ini -\ntiative matters. A  unit will be relatively more autonomous if it can anticipate the \nexploitation of its systems\u2019 vulnerability before they are exploited, while simul -\ntaneously leveraging the opportunity to exploit others\u2019 systems. The combination \nof these two factors provides the unit capacity for initiative, which in the most \n\n42 Richard J. Harknett\nfundamental way asserts and reinforces the unit\u2019s fundamental orientation to seek \nand struggle over autonomy. The only way to seize and retain initiative in such a \ndynamic environment is to persist in the pursuit of it. To do otherwise is to cede the \ncapacity to define the conditions of security and insecurity to others and to miss  the \nopportunity to change the relative distribution of power, which the digital environ -\nment can directly impact. The cyber strategic environment\u2019s structural imperative \nof initiative persistence aligns with the fundamental and overall structural impera -\ntive to seek autonomy.\nInterconnectedness does not supplant the structural feature of anarchy under -\nstood as the absence of centralised authority but rather reinforces it. The origi -\nnal technical objective of the ARPANET was to create a communication structure \nwithout a centre (no centralised authority) and, thus, the network structure in fact \naligns with the organising nature of anarchy conceptually. Without a hierarchy of \ncontrol, what interconnectedness induces \u2013 persistence in the pursuit of initiative \n\u2013 logically reinforces the self-reliance imperative of all units within the global \ndistribution of power. Cyberspace, in this conceptualisation, represents a tightly \nknitted diffused power environment in which slight margins separate units making \nthem intensely focused on ways in which they can gain or lose relative autonomy. \nThe core structural features of cyberspace thus induce a propensity that becomes \nimperative \u2013 one must persist in seeking initiative to advance autonomy; otherwise, \nautonomy might be overwhelmed due to the scale, scope and speed of activity that \none cedes to others. One\u2019s place in the overall distribution of power might not shift \ndue to direct attack or war, but more complexly and subtly through not keeping \napace and retaining some initiative that allows the wherewithal to act \u2013 to have \nautonomy. Bjola and Kornprobst are correct when they surmise that what may \nserve as a default line of success or failure is whether units can adapt to the pace \nof this environment.\nWhat is occurring at the individual user level is instructive of this adaptation \nvariable. Individual human users of digital applications and networked comput -\ning are losing initiative as more and more decision-making is ceded to algorithm \ncalculations of how one should get to the place to purchase what has already been \nimperceptibly chosen for oneself based on the behavioural data profile one has \nagreed to provide in return for the \u2018free\u2019 use of an app. When one contemplates that \ndynamic of loss of decision control at the international actor level (states and big \ntechnology companies), it becomes easy to see that the competition over relative \npower to retain autonomy is intense and intensifying.\nIt is important to note, however, that the intensity of competition over initia -\ntive does not necessarily portend an increase in coercion and direct armed conflict \n(Fischerkeller  & Harknett, 2019 ). There is little doubt that cyber means will enable \nwarfare in different ways. A  reasonable assumption is that states will not fight war \nwithout some cyberspace component moving forward, either in how it directly \nimpacts the use of conventional weapons or through networked computing opera -\ntions as stand alone. The empirical record of the past 30  years since networked \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  43\ncomputing has become ubiquitous suggests another reasonable assumption: that \nintense cyber and cyber-enabled competition may not lead to armed conflict or \narmed attack equivalence in cyberspace. Much of the literature in cyber security \nstudies and in policy documents have focused on the potential for cyber war, but \nwe should concentrate more on what has been and is happening daily in cyber stra -\ntegic competition ( Harknett  & Smeets, 2020 ). States have been incredibly active \nin seeking to change the conditions of their own security and potential to advance \ntheir interests through cyber operations that fall well below the threshold of war. \nTraditionally, realists have focused on war because it was the primary means \nthrough which to shift relative power directly. Coercion \u2013 leveraging the prospec -\ntive threat of imposed costs through deterrence and compellence \u2013 has been a major \nfocus of security studies ( Greenhill  & Krause, 2018 ). But the intense competition \nin cyberspace is not primarily coercive in nature. It is not directed at shifting the \nother side\u2019s decision calculus. Rather the primary activity is exploitation of vulner -\nability to set and reset the digital space in one\u2019s favour. This can be both protective \nand additive in orientation, but it is continuous and persistent in application ( Fis-\ncherkeller  & Harknett, 2020 ).\nContemporary Digital IR and Beyond\nThe complexity of contemporary international relations becomes apparent when \nrelying on the most parsimonious of theories that, in part, strive to reduce such \ncomplexity. An application of structural autonomy theory to current global poli -\ntics reveals a complex interplay between the systemic wide global distribution of \npower and the distinct seam  that cyberspace has opened up for unit-level action of \nsignificance within a definable new cyber strategic environment.\nSet historically, 2023 still represents an overall distribution of power that is con -\ncentrated in nature around the United States. The presence or absence, engagement, \nor retreat of American involvement across the full spectrum of international issues, \nfrom public health during a pandemic, climate change, trade, regional conflicts \nand even domestic turns towards populism and authoritarianism matters globally \nmore than the positions and decisions of other states. It is not simply the direct \napplication of American economic power in the 2012 global great recession that \nmattered in buffeting the international economy. The recognition that no other state \nsought to take advantage of US economic decline during that period reinforces \nthe notion of American centrality or pervasiveness globally ( Kovac, 2021 ). When \nthe United States withdraws from international treaties, such as the Paris Accords, \nit has a profound effect on global climate policy efforts; its reengagement with \nsuch international arrangement will set international action on a different course \nas well. In the military sphere, while non-state actors have engaged US forces for \ndecades, no significant military seeks directly to challenge the United States at \na core national security level via military action. The concentrated nature of the \npower distribution should drive most states towards stabilising the concentration, \n\n44 Richard J. Harknett\nseeking if not cooperation, then some levels of accommodation even among rivals, \nbasically an advancing of autonomy within  the current system. States are consist -\nently managing their relative autonomy, but none of the most capable major powers \nare willing to confront the United States in traditional realist expectations through \nmilitary engagement to change the distribution of power. The last 30  years since \nthe collapse of the bifurcated diffused power environment anchored around the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union have tracked along the expectations of struc -\ntural autonomy hypotheses. There has been more systemic clever buy-in to man -\nage and gain autonomy (e.g. consider China\u2019s approach to the global free market \nsystem) than direct challenge through traditional power means.\nBut as noted earlier, while the macro-level distribution is a system-wide rela -\ntive concentration, the emergence of cyberspace has created a sub-strata or lattice \nthat reflects an intensifying and tightening diffused power environment in which, \nthrough digital means, very tight margins exist on whether one is advancing or \nceding autonomy.17 We, therefore, appear to be witnessing a two-level game in \nwhich through traditional means no one of significance is challenging the centrality \nof American overall capacity directly. No major state wants to go to war with the \nUnited States to change the distribution of power. And yet many are intensely chal -\nlenging American power in and through cyberspace, in part because the condition -\nalities of cyberspace drive the imperative to do so (the idea of persistence), but also \nbecause the opportunity to achieve advancement of autonomy exists through the \ncyber strategic environment in ways that are not available in the conventional and \nnuclear strategic spaces. Cyberspace has opened the seam up for strategic competi -\ntion with significant potential to affect the distribution of power without the need \nfor conventional or nuclear warfare.\nSome of what is being witnessed in terms of state cyber activity is narrow stra -\ntegic behaviour through leveraging a new means. North Korea seeks to sustain its \nautonomy through nuclear capability but is under immense pressure through eco -\nnomic sanctions to relinquish those means. North Korean manipulation of digital \nfinancial transactions through sophisticated strategic cyber campaigns is a direct \nattempt to undermine the international sanctions regime and pressure policy of \nthe United States and its allies ( Fischerkeller et  al., 2022 ). Success in securing \nresources through cyber theft is not crime. It is a strategic response to the distri -\nbution of power and an attempt to build and retain the capacity for fundamental \nautonomy that nuclear possession provides, which without cyber-enabled under -\nmining of sanctions might not be sustainable.\nRussia appears to have taken seriously the notion that cyberspace could under -\nmine domestic confidence in institutional authority. Its management of its internal \nlegal system seeks to limit such propensity by its own citizens aligned with outside \nsupporters and in complete alignment with initiative expectations has, since the \nPanama Papers release, sought to put western states on the defensive over contest -\ning institutional legitimacy (with a particular focus on experimenting with infor -\nmation manipulation during electoral cycles). Seen through this frame, Russia is \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  45\npersistently undermining institutional authority elsewhere to distract and deflect \nany attempts to undermine its own institutional authority at home. While Soviet \npropaganda efforts were renowned, Russian (and Iranian) cyber-enabled infor -\nmation manipulation as a means to support an overall delegitimisation campaign \nagainst US democratic authority is at a scale, scope and speed that makes it a direct \nthreat to institutional national power in the United States (as witnessed in part with \nthe storming of its Capitol to contest an election process on 6 January  2021).\nChina appears to have a grander strategic sense of how its overall priorities \ncan be advanced leveraging cyberspace. Behind in many research and develop -\nment areas, China has used alignment of economic development policies, indus -\ntrial policies, and where necessary illicit cyber campaigns to both close the gap in \ncore technological R&D and begin to deploy an infrastructure globally that rests \non a construct of information control as opposed to the information dissemination \nmodel upon which the western internet was anchored. The initiative is full spec -\ntrum across hardware, software, commercial and military uses all directed towards \nadvancing a more autonomous China. While Russia might be trying to level the \nplaying field, China is seeking to change core international policies and power \ndynamics as well as the overall distribution of power itself as structural autonomy \nexpects in tight diffused power environment.\nThe United States seems to be catching up to the duality of a macro-level con -\ncentrated power structure it (hesitantly and currently) leads and an intense sub-  \nstratum of a diffused cyber strategic environment. The US national security  strategy \ndocuments acknowledge that great power competition is back and note impor -\ntantly that rivals are seeking strategic gains below the threshold of war through \ncyberspace.18 The United States\u2019 adoption of the doctrine of persistent engagement \n(Nakasone, 2020 ) portends a more active operational approach that seeks initiative \nin setting the conditions of cyber and national security. The United States\u2019 refram -\ning of issues like 5G adoption not as a technical vulnerability concern, which was \nits original framing, but as a competing model of internet governance and infra -\nstructure structure suggests a shift towards a strategic competition modus operandi, \nspecifically regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China.\nWill the dynamics of this persistently competitive space cumulate to put at risk \nunits\u2019 relative position such that we could see shifts of power without traditional \nwar? We must think through the study of such possibilities because structural \nincentives are there to produce such outcomes. We must also consider the potential \nfor cross over, where the sustained loss of initiative in cyberspace induces resort \nto traditional means of conflict to wrest a macro-level slide in the distribution of \npower. While states currently appear to see it in their strategic advantage to com -\npete below the threshold of war through cyberspace, it will take prudent statecraft \nto manage competition so that competitive success does not push a major power (or \nthe United States) into a corner, where war comes under serious consideration as \na last resort option. This is at least one explanation for Russian aggression against \nUkraine in February of 2022.\n\n46 Richard J. Harknett\nFinally, as scholars, we need to look beyond the tips of our shoes. Trend analysis \nwould reveal at least two important considerations: algorithmic decision-making is \ngoing to advance in which the human will be taken out of the loop on many mun -\ndane repeatable tasks and eventually on tasks, such as driving, that while complex \ncan be conditionalised and thus anticipated by the algorithm. The advantages of \nspeed, scale and scope will only increase the pressure to hand more core func -\ntions that cumulate to national power over to the algorithm. As wealth generation, \nfor example, requires the human to minimally move \u2018on-the-loop\u2019 if not out of it, \ncontest over the algorithm itself may follow the pattern of previous core sources of \npower such as arable land or energy (oil), but with a twist. Do the companies that \ndeploy the algorithms need the state as an intervening factor in their pursuit of profit \nor will the sophistication of the platform itself and the reliance the state has on it \nshift power to the point that some of the largest private sector owners and develop -\ners become strategic actors in their own right? Can they develop the wherewithal \nto have the capacity to act \u2013 relative strategic autonomy? In 2022, in the case of \nthe Russian-Ukrainian war, we witnessed private sector companies such as Starlink \nand Microsoft have direct battlefield impact. These were individual private sector \ndigital players affecting conduct of war through their independent decisions to sup -\nport Ukraine. Armed conflict had always been the high-end province of states, but \nthe interconnectedness of cyberspace meant what these companies independently \ndecided to do early on in the war had direct impact ( Smith, 2022 ; Vinion, 2022 ).\nWhile we must be open to unit diversification theoretically, the more immedi -\nate challenge is to understand how the dynamics of cyberspace that flow from \nits structure will impact the overall distribution of power. This analysis suggests \nthat the persistence that follows from interconnectedness has minimally opened a \nseam in power competition and the imperative of self-reliance and the struggling \nover autonomy will intensify given the condition that small margins of initiative \ncan impact sources of national power. Illuminating the conditions under which \nsuch competition remains short of armed conflict or its digital equivalent is a pre -\nscriptive necessity if the expectations of structural autonomy concerning tightly \nknitted diffuse power environments are accurate (that they tend to produce con -\nflict). Persistent action by itself does not necessitate conflict, but it should focus \nthe mind when thinking theoretically about digital IR if we wish to avoid such a \nnegative outcome. At a minimum seen through cyber persistence theory and struc -\ntural autonomy, Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s digital disruption feedback loop suggests a \nperiod of intense strategic competition is upon us internationally.\nNotes\n 1 For a full development of structural autonomy, see Harknett and Yalcin (2012 ). That 2012 \nargument did not consider the emergence of cyberspace from a structuralist perspective \nand, in particular, the sub-structure or \u2018lattice\u2019 of interconnectedness, introduced here \nas a new theoretical construct. The cyber-related application of the theory of structural \nautonomy is therefore the sole responsibility of this individual author, although where \n\nThe Distribution of Power, Security and Interconnectedness  47\nappropriate, direct sections of the previous Harknett and Yalcin work are re-presented, \nadapted and revised here so as to properly credit that original argument.\n 2 The US Government definition of cyberspace is a reasonable starting point: \u2018A global \ndomain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network \nof information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications net -\nworks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers\u2019 (National Institute \nof Standards and Technology, 2012). The terms cyberspace and cybersecurity remain \ncontested, and this chapter introduces a structuralist notion of cyberspace as a lattice \nthat lays across the overall distribution of power globally with a recognition of Betz and \nStevens (2013 ) caution from eight years ago that conceptual clarity is critical if our study \nof cyber phenomena is to improve.\n 3 Interconnectedness should be understood as distinct from the notion of interdependence \n(Keohane  & Nye, 1977 ). It fundamentally rests on the nature of networked computing. \nFor the purposes of this chapter, cyberspace is defined as the \u2018global domain within \nthe information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information \nsystems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer \nsystems, and embedded processors and controllers\u2019 (NIST, Computer Security Resource \nCenter).\n 4 For the alternative view on cyber interconnectedness and that reimposition is occurring \nin cyberspace, see Demchak and Dombrowski (2011 ).\n 5 In essence, defensive realism anchors explanation on the presence of vulnerability while \noffensive realism focuses on opportunity (Waltz, 2000). The realist-informed structural \ntheory offered here assumes a dynamic and fluid environment in which the orientation \nmust be focused on seizing initiative, not playing offense or defence.\n 6 This assumption might provoke criticism from a domestic-level  perspective. Even \nif states might form their own preferences because of domestic reasons, they should \nbe ignored in a structural analysis because structuralism is based on the belief of the \nremoval of domestic concerns due to the overruling character of structural factors. For \nan example of domestic preference formation, see Moravcsik (1997 ).\n 7 This is a reference to Morgentha u\u2019s famous frame about international politics as a strug -\ngle for power and its dominant role in the field. Also see Mearsheimer (2001 ). Rather \nthan making a base assumption independently, a theory of structural autonomy derives \nthe dynamic of struggle for autonomy from the structure which is composed of anarchy \nas a self-reliance system and distribution of power. This is the only unit level motivation \nthat can be derived structurally and covers all units with its primitive and comprehensive \nnature.\n 8 For a similar but underdeveloped ar gument about the existence of both opportunities and \nconstraints, see Mastanduno (1997 ).\n 9 Against most of the critics, Waltz was certainly right in claiming that states are function -\nally similar units. This is the most distinctive and only characteristic of the concept of \nanarchy. If state functions are differentiated, then there would be no conceptual meaning \nof the term anarchy. For the most prominent examples of these critics, see Buzan et  al. \n(1993 ), Ruggie (1986).\n 10 In the real world of international affairs, there is no Rawls (1971) \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019. \nStates are aware of the limitations of their power. They roughly know their position in \nthe distribution of power. In making their decisions they take their relative power posi -\ntions into consideration. They are individually unable to bring about a structural change, \nbut in theory if every member of the system delegated their autonomy the system would \nchange \u2013 this is the regional system lesson of the US former colonies moving from \nthe articles of confederation to a \u2018United\u2019 States of America. But as long as one unit \nremained self-reliant and possessive of its autonomy, by definition the system overall \nwould lack a central authority. The American change regionally did not affect the struc -\nture of the international system. The integration of the European Union can be thought \n\n48 Richard J. Harknett\nof similarly. The other theoretical path to hierarchy is the successful coercion of the \nmost powerful state in overwhelming all others\u2019 capacity to remain self-reliant; that is \nthe establishment of a global empire. Thus, autonomy could disappear through a path \npremised on the promise of greater reward via a buy-in to consolidate into a larger unit \nor through forcible aggregation.\n 11 A similar conceptualisation of hierarchy in anarchic orders might be found in David \nLake\u2019s writings. But Lake uses a legalist concept of hierarchy which deemphasises the \nsignificance of state autonomy at the expense of a higher authority , see Lake (2007 ).\n 12 The concept of autonomy which depends on capabilities should not be confused with \nsovereignty, which is a legal concept. Despite the legal claim for the sovereignty of all \nstates since Westphalia, there can be no absolutely autonomous agent in the system. \nAutonomy requires the full freedom of an agent, which dominates the entire structure \nwith its capabilities. If this was the case, then the international structure would not be an \nanarchic order but it would be defined as a hierarchic one. Autonomy is essentially an \nelusive goal. The struggle for it reproduces the anarchic order rather than collapsing it in \nfavour of a specific unit.\n 13 Initial development without reference to cyberspace of this table is found in Harknett \nand Yalcin (2012).\n 14 Here structural autonomy departs from Waltz\u2019s Man, the State and War  in suggesting \nthat explanation remains at the structural level, rather than as Waltz argued shifting to the \nunit or state level to explain the immediate causes of war (1959). Additionally, structure \nmatters so much that it affects the type of war that is likely to be fought. In concentrated \nstructures, war will be limited in objective and application, for example.\n 15 Concentrated power environment in this study refers to a high level of power concentra -\ntion. It can be viewed as hegemonic position gained by one unit over others in terms \nof power. But that concept of hegemony should not be confused with hierarchy, when \ndiscussing the organising principle of the overall system itself.\n 16 Depending on specific power environments, states hold second-level motivations  \n(orientation) for change or retention. Therefore, a state is defined as motivated for change \nif it wants to break down the distributed international power environment. In contrast, \na state is defined as motivated for retention, if it views the status quo as a favourable \ninternational structure and pursues actions that do not challenge the overall concentrated \nnature of the system.\n 17 Some may argue that a high percentage of core cyber infrastructure of routers and inter -\nnet service providers still remain in US territory and or under US influence, but the \nessential elements necessary to exercise cyber power directly are not inaccessible to oth -\ners. The ability to act in cyberspace is diffused across many units. While it is primarily \nAmerican aircraft carriers, which few nations have, that patrol the oceans, cyberspace \ncapabilities to operate and exploit vulnerabilities to advance cumulative strategic gains \nare held, and most important to note, employed,  regularly against American interests by \nmany states.\n 18 This assertion is found coherently through official documents including the 2017 \nNational Security Strategy, the 2018 National Defense Strategy, 2018 Department of \nDefense Cyber Strategy and the 2018 US Cyber Command Vision document. It was also \ncaptured in the March  2023 Biden Administration National Cybersecurity Strategy.\nReferences\nBetz, D.,  & Stevens, T. (2013).  Analogical reasoning and cyber security.

They involve different kinds \nof balances. Thinkers interested in the confluence of ideology and technology \ncan explore its effects on the strivings of revolutionary states on the world scene \n(Adamsky, 2008 ). Another question that will matter especially to strategic studies \nanalysts is how new technology influences the balance of offensive and defensive \nforces on the battlefield \u2013 possibly with decisive consequences for conflict stability \n(Glaser  & Kaufmann, 1998 ; Lieber, 2000 ; Slayton, 2017 ). Theorists with a mind \nfor grander questions about great power competitions can ask how it affects the \nbalance of power, especially military power, among large states ( Horowitz, 2018 ). \nBut perhaps the most important question of all concerns a different kind of balance, \nthe balance of players : In what ways does the new technology alter the hierarchy, \nnot among states, but among states and other actors?1\nThe most fundamental form of technological revolution in the international sys -\ntem occurs when players alien to it challenge the dominance of its main unit, the \nstate. Though potentially important for international order, lesser forms of change \ndo not supersede the system\u2019s organisational structure. They unfold within a given \ninternational system; they may even help to preserve the hierarchy of actors if new \ntechnology enhances the dominant players\u2019 relative power and interests.\nThe rapid expansion of cyberspace during the last three decades presents such a \nfundamental question ( Kello, 2017 ). This chapter explores it. Through their influ -\nence on cyberspace, actors other than states challenge their customary dominance \nin core areas of national security and international affairs. This trend represents \na major aspect of change in what this book calls \u2018agential\u2019 processes, whereby 2\nTHE STATE IN THE DIGITAL ERA\nSupreme or in Decline?\nLucas Kello\n\n52 Lucas Kello\ninterstate dealings are increasingly influenced by nontraditional actors (such as \nlarge technology firms) that must be forced, enticed or won over in efforts by states \nto impose order upon a complex technological world that they neither own nor (in \nmany instances) dominate. Agential change has given rise to a situation of state \nabsence : the state has partly receded in its traditionally preponderant role in pro -\ntecting the infrastructure that underpins vital societal and economic functions as \nwell as in ensuring the integrity of basic political institutions. Private players have \nbegun to fill the statist void both as threat actors and as security providers, with \nimportant implications for theory and statecraft.\nCyberspace has not made governments irrelevant, as some na\u00efve utopians have \ndesired. The \u2018cyber libertarian\u2019 movement seems trapped within a contradiction: \nadherents seek or predict the liquefaction of the state by the Internet\u2019s centrifu -\ngal forces even as they advocate assiduously for the minimisation of government \nregulation of those same forces (which implies that the government\u2019s role is in \nfact significant). Consider the political activist John Perry Barlow who in 1996 \nproclaimed a vision of technological statelessness: \u2018Governments of the Industrial \nWorld, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I  come from Cyberspace, the new \nhome of Mind\u2019, after which ensued the prediction: \u2018On behalf of the future, I  ask \nyou of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have no \nsovereignty where we gather\u2019 ( Barlow, 2016 ). In 2013, Google CEO Eric Schmidt \nand Jared Cohen echoed Barlow\u2019s assertion: \u2018The internet is the largest experi -\nment involving anarchy in history\u2019 \u2013 a benevolent anarchy, that is, not the perilous \njungle of Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u2018natural man\u2019 that Leviathan supplanted. \u2018The most sig -\nnificant impact of the spread of communication technologies will be the way that \nthey help reallocate the concentration of power away from states and institutions \nand transfer it to individuals\u2019 ( Schmidt  & Cohen, 2014 ). And yet both Barlow and \nSchmidt have warned about growing government encroachment upon the unfet -\ntered Internet, Schmidt going as far as predicting the emergence by 2028 of dys -\ntopian Internets quashed by the authoritarian (especially Chinese) state ( Shaban, \n2018 ; Silverman, 2015 ).\nSuch visions of techno-anarchism manifest the two dualisms that often charac -\nterise revolutionary movements (technological or not): the prophets who foresee \nchange also serve as its chief agents; and to them the final stage of revolution \nappears inevitable (because it is foreordained by material or historical forces) even \nas its realisation requires a managed intervention to resist countervailing forces. \nWhat else but a combination of the inevitability of statelessness and the intransi -\ngence of the state could motivate the cyber libertarians at one and the same time to \nproclaim its inevitable demise even while working \u2013 at times precariously \u2013 against \nits regulatory intrusions?\nThe utopians\u2019 vision remains remote. Far likelier to materialise (we can already \nsee it) is Schmidt\u2019s vision of a bifurcated Internet in which the state suppresses \nlarge swaths of online human activity. Yet the utopian perspective is not entirely \ngroundless. The expansion of cyberspace has given rise to early and partial forms \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  53\nof state absence in important aspects \u2013 notably, the provision of national security \nin areas such as energy security, financial system security and information security \nin election contexts. States have not lost their traditional supremacy over private \nactors; international relations is still mainly interstate relations. But in important \nsecurity domains, other actors are rapidly growing in relevance and even primacy.\nThe reasons for this development are partly technological. They concern the \nincreasing use of computers to support the life of the state. As more and more gov -\nernmental functions are captured, stored and transmitted in the form of computer \ncode \u2013 that is, \u2018datafication\u2019 and \u2018pervasiveness\u20192 \u2013 coupled with the speed and \nease of transmission of code, the opportunities for adversaries to access informa -\ntion about those functions and to use it to disrupt them grow. That computer code \ngoverns the behaviour of the very machines that underpin governmental functions, \nrather than merely storing information about them, means that datafication and per -\nvasiveness enable not just new forms of espionage but also political disruption and \nmachine destruction. More than just a source of power, information has become \nforce itself ( Kello, 2017 , p. 5).\nCybersecurity problems inhere also in the technical features of the global \nInternet, the vastest and most diverse realm of cyberspace comprising billions \nof users and devices. The TCP/IP protocol that governs Internet communications \nwas designed in the 1980s to prioritise the successful delivery of data packets \nrather than the authentication of their contents or their senders\u2019 identity and loca -\ntion ( Clark, 2018 ) \u2013 salient details for security analysis and authorities seeking to \nimpose control over them. These design choices are the technical underpinnings \nof the current pervasiveness and sheer speed of the modern Internet, which act as \nforces of disruption in international relations. A  different ordering of priorities \u2013 \nthat is, the elevation of packet authentication over packet delivery \u2013 would likely \nhave decelerated the speed of communication over the Internet and thereby stunted \nits expansion. Instead of complaints about the murkiness and dizzying speed of \ndata transmission, today we might hear more gripes about the inaccessibility of the \nInternet (if we would even call it that) from untrusted devices and locations and its \nslowness.3\nThe Internet is not completely borderless, however. Its physical layer of routers \nand services resides in defined territory that is subject to the direct intervention of \nsovereigns. But the ease and speed with which code travels across the global infor -\nmation skin mean that national frontiers are eminently porous. Even machines in \nthe \u2018cyber archipelago\u2019 ( Kello, 2013 , p. 17) comprising computer systems that are \nnot joined to the Internet are penetrable by code, sometimes with serious results, \nas illustrated by the Stuxnet worm\u2019s destruction of almost one-thousand uranium \nenrichment centrifuges at the nuclear facility in Natanz, Iran.\nAnother driver of state absence is legal and political: the unwillingness or \ninability of the government to constrain the growth and regulate the activities \nof the large technology companies that built and developed digital products and \nservices. This is largely an American story. Although the US government has \n\n54 Lucas Kello\nsought to impose pro-competition measures against the early digital technol -\nogy giants \u2013 for example, suing and compelling Microsoft in 1998 to share its \nsource code with market competitors \u2013 the companies and their services emerged \nmostly free from regulation. Two main reasons explain this development. For \none, companies such as Google and Facebook that emerged later than Microsoft \nhave heeded the lessons of its brushes with the authorities. They have adeptly \nengaged legislators and regulators on questions of data privacy and ethics, for \nexample. More than important and controversial, these questions are also new \nand not easily answered, for they involve largely untested trade-offs (e.g. between \nthe companies\u2019 revenue models, which often involve the use of targeted adverts, \nand the privacy rights of users who might not want their personal information col -\nlected or shared with advertisers). Having inserted themselves into the regulatory \nprocess in its formative stage, the technology giants can influence its direction \nand outcome. The data behemoths have repeatedly called for tighter government \nregulation of their own services;4 what they really want is not regulation but a \nseat at the regulatory table. For another, more fundamentally, the necessity for \nregulation sometimes becomes clear only after the technologies have become \ndiffused, at which point the cost of imposing it is possibly prohibitively high; or \nelse by the time regulation comes into force, the technologies and their use have \nrendered it less relevant or effective. And then there is the problem of outmoded \nlegacy laws: for example, the blanket restrictions on data and system access in \nBritain\u2019s Computer Misuse Act (1990) that precedes the social Internet by several \nyears and which impedes threat analysis, placing defensively minded security \nresearchers in potential legal peril.5\nInasmuch as governments are unwilling rather than unable to exercise their reg -\nulatory powers to reel in the enormous influence of the digital behemoths (possibly \nbecause their unbridled influence confers economic benefits), then state absence \nrepresents a kind of state delegation \u2013 a recession of the state that unfolds with its \ntacit understanding and condonement in a realm where it once had authority (e.g. \nfinancial sector security). That is different to a situation where the state decides \nnot to regulate activity over which it did not previously exercise authority \u2013 pos -\nsibly because the activity in question did not exist before, as in the case of the \ndevelopment of artificially intelligent algorithms (which Claudia Aradau explores \nin Chapter  7). If the state were to impose its regulatory powers within these two \nbroad scenarios, then we would have to distinguish two forms of state \u2018pushback\u2019: \nrollback and encroachment (more on state pushback below).\nThe chapter contains four sections. The first section briefly presents concepts \nto categorise the degree and scope of change in relative unit agency: supremacy, \nprimacy and relevance. The second section applies them to analyse the growing \nimportance of non-state actors \u2013 especially multinational technology firms \u2013 as \nkey players in traditional realms of state activity. The third section examines \nstate absence and the growing relevance of non-state actors in empirical con -\ntexts of cybersecurity and information security. The fourth section analyses the \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  55\nphenomenon of state pushback, that is, attempts by states to reassert their domi -\nnance in national security provision.\nBalance of Player Concepts: Actor Supremacy, Primacy \nand\u00a0Relevance\nWe begin with a conceptual journey. Imagine a foreign visitor exploring the theo -\nretical realm of international relations. He would discover a tragic world of citizen-\nstates bound together more by inexpiable competition and rivalry than by comity \nand cooperation. In many places, he might be struck by the scene\u2019s apparent uni -\nformity. Despite the inhabitants\u2019 extreme variety of domestic styles and homes \n(some majestic palaces, others tiny huts), they display similar habits in pursuit of \nuniversal objectives in security and welfare.\nBut the more striking feature of homogeneity concerns the other creatures of the \nrealm \u2013 private corporations, civil society groups, transnational networks, individ -\nuals, etc. They are often absent or hidden from view (sometimes completely). The \ncitizen-states rule the land, and sometimes each other, almost as if the other beings \ndid not exist. Of course, the traveller would know that they do exist. Along the cen -\ntral roads he can spot occasional international organisations with their impressive \nbuildings \u2013 some operating like emergency field hospitals, others like science labs \u2013  \nand their diverse functionaries (who often pledged allegiance to or are emissaries \nof a citizen-state). But this bevy of other actors remains largely out of sight and \nmostly ignored; theorists have crammed them all inside the homes of the citizen-\nstates, to whose whims and instructions they respond. The lesser players emerge \nwhen summoned by the master citizens amid their internecine battles or coopera -\ntive efforts, only to be sent back indoors after performing the supporting role; or \nelse they are banished entirely from the realm. Everywhere one finds evidence of \nthe other actors\u2019 existence, yet sightings are few and their roles seem rarely conse -\nquential next to the dominant actors.\nNot all model worlds, to be sure, share the theoretical prejudice of state cen -\ntrism. Some alternative models eschew the unitary actor mania; they afford a \nmore prominent and sometimes decisive role for the other actors. More funda -\nmentally, they deconstruct the state, refusing to treat it is a coherent (some would \nsay \u2018anthropomorphised\u2019) player ( Franke  & Roos, 2010 ; Klose, 2020 ; Lerner, \n2020 ; Wendt, 2004 ). The real actors that matter, these scholars hold, reside within \nand beyond the state. The state itself, in fact, comprises the other actors to which \nit cannot be reduced but from which also it cannot be separated. So if one were \nto ask, What is it like to be a state?, the traditional theorist\u2019s answer \u2013 it is like \nbeing John Stuart Mill\u2019s rational and unitary homo economicus  writ large \u2013 is \nmisguided. Although states might exhibit an emergent and rudimentary \u2018stream of \nconsciousness\u2019 arising from a complex integration of information systems among \ncomponent entities, they lack the singular personhood that characterises their \nhuman subjects ( Lerner, 2020 ).\n\n56 Lucas Kello\nBut if we focus on what is traditionally meant by the \u2018international system\u2019, if \nwe examine the more established models that defined the discipline (especially \nthe conventional neorealist model refined by Richard Harknett in Chapter  1) and \nto which the main security paradigms remain wedded, the orthodoxy of the state\u2019s \ndominance atop the hierarchy of players becomes plainer. Even the most reaction -\nary theorist cannot deny it: other actors exist and may even be important in inter -\nstate affairs.6 Rather, the point behind state centrism is that theoretical construction \nin international relations requires, as David Lake put it, a \u2018methodological bet\u2019 that \na focus on states and their interactions will yield the most potent explanations of \ninternational affairs even if it glosses out lesser players\u2019 influence ( Lake, 2015 ). \nEven classical liberals whose worldview centres on a \u2018harmony of interests\u2019 among \nthe peoples of the world emphasise the importance of the relations among the sov -\nereigns, not the peoples they rule (think of the \u2018democratic peace theory\u2019: it refers \nto relations among liberal democratic states , not people).7\nBy extension, any demonstrable effect of technological empowerment of actors \nalien to the system \u2013 that is, the emergence of new agential processes \u2013 represents \na potentially major challenge to the discipline\u2019s central tenets. A  change in the \nbalance of power among the large states \u2013 a common concern of realists \u2013 or the \nemergence of new institutions that facilitate cooperation among them \u2013 the liberals\u2019 \ninterest \u2013 signifies important changes within  an existing international system. But \na realignment of power among different kinds  of actors can bring forth a transition \nfrom one system to another . Possibly it may even signal an exit from the states \nsystem to a system exhibiting a different organising tenet altogether, such as in \nHedley Bull\u2019s notion of \u2018neo-medievalism\u2019, a conception of system in which no \nparticular actor reigned supreme over others; instead, states, religious bodies, cit -\nies, principalities, private military companies and even individuals (by way of a \ngrowing consciousness of the \u2018world common good\u2019) shared and competed for the \nterrestrial spoils of sovereignty ( Bull, 1977 ). Especially important in this regard is \nthe influence of other actors in the state\u2019s core security affairs. International rela -\ntions thinkers contest the meaning of security, varyingly referring to physical sur -\nvival and territorial integrity, economic stability and growth, the \u2018human security\u2019 \nof citizens, and so on. But they almost universally agree that states pursue it as the \nultimate end of statecraft owing to the uncertainties and insecurities of the inter -\nnational system\u2019s anarchic nature. Therefrom stems Kenneth Waltz\u2019s maxim about \nactor autonomy: states abhor a loss of independence to other actors in the pursuit of \nnational security goals \u2013 unless dependence on others provides a net security gain \n(e.g. a state might want to invite an ally\u2019s military forces into its territory to avoid \noccupation and annexation by a larger common enemy), but even then the tying \nof fates among allies represents a sub-optimal outcome to security independence.\nConfronted with the state-centric theoretical model, practitioners will ask a \nquestion that some theorists eschew: what relevance does it have to the affairs of \nthe citizen-states? The answer is clear: the abstractions of the system model (any \nmodel) are useful only insofar as they help to identify the possibilities and limits \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  57\nof action in the complex world of policymaking. The usefulness might involve \n(and is perhaps strongest when it does so) explanations and predictions about gen -\neral trends in international affairs that can orient action in different historical or \ngeographic settings. But even a model that does no more than impose conceptual \ncoherence among an empirical reality that is infinitely more complex than the abil -\nity of policymakers to comprehend might perform an important service outside of \nthe academy.\nThus, from the backdrop of the state\u2019s theoretical supremacy arises the ques -\ntion of its empirical  supremacy: does theoretical prejudice accord with reality in \nthe study of technological revolution? In other words, does modern technology \nempower actors other than states such that the conventional units have lost the \ndominance that they so jealously guard in the model world?\nThis \u2018meta\u2019 question calls forth not just hypotheses and empirical discussion \nbut also debate about the starting axioms of theory. To begin to answer it \u2013 even if \njust provisionally because we are still in the early stage of the cyber  revolution \u2013  \nwe require two sets of distinctions. One concerns the relative degree of unit agency, \nthat is, some conceptual benchmark on which to evaluate relative influence among \nactors within the system. Three degrees of influence are possible: relevance, pri -\nmacy and supremacy. Relevance is the lowest kind of relative influence. It denotes \ninfluence that is sufficient for theorists to take note of the secondary players, \nbecause without them the models would suffer from incompleteness and explana -\ntory shortcomings. Next up is primacy: the alien players are no longer secondary; \nthey are the foremost agents in the system and thus deserve a special place in \nthe abstract model, but not to the point of excluding other actors from the scene. \nSupremacy denotes the highest degree of relative influence: so high, in fact, that \nall other actors are irrelevant to theory construction, even if their presence is some -\ntimes felt in the dealings of the master units (which indeed are \u2018units\u2019 rather than \nbeing merely \u2018actors\u2019).\nPrivate firms we will see play a significant role in the current technological \nrevolution. Thus, it is worth illustrating, briefly, where different theories place them \nalong the agency spectrum. Neorealism posits the total supremacy of states (some -\ntimes as an analytical assumption, other times seemingly as a moral objective). \nPrivate firms are almost completely absent from this theoretical universe, except \ninsofar as they contribute resources that strengthen the military and industrial \npower of the state to which they are subordinate ( Lobell, Ripsman,  & Taliaferro, \n2009 ). Classical liberalism illustrates the difference between relevance and pri -\nmacy. In this perspective, private firms play an important role in fostering interstate \ncommerce \u2013 a central concern of liberal thinkers who posit that free trade sustains \nthe harmony of interests among nations which in turn helps to pacify their rela -\ntions (permanently, in the case of liberal democracies) ( Doyle, 1983 ; Gat, 2005 ; \nRosecrance, 2013 ; Russett, Layne, Spiro,  & Doyle, 1995 ). This point, however, \ndoes not mean that the private actors have usurped states\u2019 primacy, much less their \nsupremacy. Governments retain their dominant role even in the most intense areas \n\n58 Lucas Kello\nof private economic activity, such as global finance, because of their domestic regu -\nlatory powers, their ability to shape macroeconomic and monetary policy, and their \ninfluence over international institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund) \nthat provide decisive levers of state control in core aspects of the world economy.8\nWe can summarise the spectrum of possible change in the balance of players \nas follows. It begins on the low end with the preservation of the state\u2019s traditional \nsupremacy over all other actors, who are neither units nor players in any meaning -\nful sense of those terms and who thus are rightly banished from the theoretical \nrealm. At the middle of the spectrum, the state vies for relevance and even primacy \nwith other rising actors, whom thinkers can thus no longer wish out of existence \nby conceptual fiat. In some areas of traditional state affairs, the usurping actors \nmight be more important than the states themselves, but not necessarily to the point \nwhere the state itself has lost relevance. That would be the high end of the spec -\ntrum of change in the balance of players. It is a world that few political thinkers \nimagine possible (although the stateless society of late-stage Marxism comes to \nmind) wherein the state has been relegated to a position of irrelevance next to the \nsub-state usurpers.\nHow closely, then, does the model of the dominant citizen-states map onto the \nlandscape of technological revolution? The state-centric optic serves well in the his -\ntorical study of technological revolution in the international system. For instance, \nit sharpens the analysis of the transforming effects of nuclear arms. States have \nreigned supreme in three key respects: in assembling and harnessing the weapons\u2019 \nawesome power, in protecting against their attendant threats, and in regulating the \nchaos and instability that can arise from the disruptive influence of their acquisition \nby other actors.\nNuclear arms emerged and proliferated among states and for state purposes. \nAnd yet private actors also played a pivotal role in the weapons\u2019 creation. Civil -\nian ingenuity provided the knowledge base for the manipulation of atomic nuclei. \nWithout civilian ingenuity the weapons would have been inconceivable; but only \nstates with their vast collective resources could have built and operated them. The \nfirst steps to purify uranium occurred in 1942 at the nuclear facility at Oak Ridge, \nTennessee. The secrecy of the site\u2019s location and the clandestine \u2013 even deceptive \u2013  \nnature of its activities are reminiscent of the \u2018closed cities\u2019 that dotted Siberia in \nthe Soviet Union. Only the immense rallying powers of the state \u2013 initially only \nthe most powerful state \u2013 could have constructed the multiple production sites, \nor marshalled the 130,000 scientists and laborers, or footed the $2  billion bill to \nproduce the nuclear devices that ushered in the \u2018balance of terror\u2019 in international \naffairs over the skies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. States have dominated nuclear \nweapons\u2019 subsequent development. In the seven decades since their invention, only \nnine states have constructed them (ten, if we include South Africa, the only country \nto have assembled, but not deployed, and later relinquished nuclear warheads). \nAt the height of the Cold War, the two superpowers possessed varyingly between \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  59\n20,000 and 70,000 warheads. At its maximum size, in 1962, the US nuclear arsenal \ncomprised more than 30,000 warheads. The Soviet arsenal numbered more than \n5,000 warheads, rising to 40,000 at its height in the 1980s. Among themselves, the \nnuclear giants could explode the earth (including their own societies) hundreds of \ntimes over. Even if their arsenals could not drive humans fully to extinction (many \nmiserable souls would likely survive under post-apocalyptic conditions of deprav -\nity) ( Starr, 2015 ), the lesser nuclear powers could nevertheless devastate the socie -\nties of their main geopolitical opponents.\nOther kinds of actors have tried to acquire nuclear weapons, notably the Al-\nQaida terrorist group ( Allison, 2004 ). Much of the effort to contain the destabilis -\ning effects of the nuclear revolution has centred on the essential goal of denying \nthe bomb to aspiring non-state proliferants. For whatever the instability caused \nby the bomb\u2019s acquisition by states \u2013 even the revolutionary state of North Korea \n(the only nuclear nation that threatens to unleash atomic terror for subversive \npolitical ends rather than to prevent it) \u2013 the proliferation of arms to terrorists and \nother non-traditional actors would cause a far more profound revolution in strate -\ngic affairs. The legal and normative devices that have succeeded in restraining the \nbomb\u2019s use among states would not suffice to contain the disruption wrought by its \nproliferation beyond them. The regulatory instruments are themselves wedded to \nstate structures: test ban treaties are signed by and bind states, intergovernmental \norganisations such as the International Atomic Energy Agency that monitor com -\npliance are largely run by states, and the taboo against the use of nuclear weapons \nemerged in a long process of normative discovery among the nuclear powers. All \nof these restraining devices would dissolve upon contact with the nuclear terrorist \nor nuclear anarchist whose very aims are subversive of the international order that \nstates and statist institutions seek to uphold. Even while competing with each other \nin a pledge of mutual annihilation, nuclear powers have worked closely together \nto preserve their monopoly over the atom\u2019s awesome power, even to the point \nof Soviet and American intelligence agencies (mortal enemies in other security \ndomains) cooperating with each other in pursuit of this common interest ( Potter  & \nBidgood, 2018 ).\nState Absence in Cyberspace: Infrastructure Protection and \nInformation Security\nArmed with basic concepts of actor hierarchies we can now analyse the growing \nimportance of non-state actors in the provision of cybersecurity, its implications \nfor larger national interests, and what it means for the balance of players in the \ninternational system. Increasingly, the realities of cybersecurity violate \u2013 some -\ntimes decisively \u2013 Waltz\u2019s central organisational tenet of state autonomy. They fuel \nthe phenomenon of state absence: government authorities are less able to provide \nfor security in cyberspace than in physical space; they increasingly rely on the \n\n60 Lucas Kello\nparticipation, resources and goodwill of private actors whose motives and interests \nmight not align with the states.\nThe problem has two sides. The first involves private infrastructure and other \nprivate interests: the state\u2019s ability to protect them is waning to the point that the \nstate is at least partly absent in important respects; consequently, the private sec -\ntor is left increasingly to its own devices. The second problem concerns the core \ninterests and activities of the state itself: it is increasingly less able to protect them \nwithout meaningful private sector involvement, in part, as we saw, because the \nstate effectively delegated to private companies a growing competence by virtue of \nnot wielding its regulatory powers against them.\nTo analyse and illustrate the phenomenon of state absence it helps to distin -\nguish two kinds of cybersecurity activity: active defence and passive defence. \nActive defence involves proactive measures, such as network interruptions and \nthe destruction of hardware, that the system defender carries out beyond the home \nnetwork to prevent or mitigate harmful action (but see below the British concep -\ntion). Passive measures involve attempts to mitigate harm from threats that have \nalready reached or breached the home network perimeter. They are far more com -\nmon and involve measures of resiliency (e.g. network firewalls) and redundancy \n(e.g. backup data and systems servers). The relative influence of states and pri -\nvate actors varies in the two areas of defence. Governments are supreme in active \ndefence because domestic law normally prohibits private actors from carrying out \n\u2018offense as defence\u2019 in other networks. Although defensively oriented, proactive \nmeasures such as \u2018hacking back\u2019 into an attacker\u2019s systems are reserved exclu -\nsively for police and other state authorities ( Kello, 2019 ). Conversely, the private \nsector \u2013 especially the multinational companies that own, design and operate vital \ninfrastructures and widely used Internet technologies such as social media \u2013 enjoy \nprimacy and possibly even supremacy in the realm of passive defence.\nState Absence in Private Infrastructure Protection\nThreats against privately owned infrastructure illustrate the problem of partial \nstate absence by way of delegation. Private companies hold the greatest capac -\nity for passive defence within their own computer terrain. Cooperation between \nthem and government authorities is common, hence why state absence is not \ntotal; it is also commonly insufficient to identify and thwart sophisticated threats \nagainst vital infrastructure. Private companies are ordinarily reluctant to invite \ngovernments into their computer systems because this could expose privileged \nclient information that the owners wish to withhold from the state for legal, com -\nmercial or reputational reasons. Thus, the source of the problem is not a lack of \ncapability: governments, at least the large and technologically savvy ones, have \nample resources and security tools that they could use to shore up private network \ndefence if the network owners allowed them to do so or if governments chose to \nimpose their will upon them.\n\nThe State in the Digital Era  61\nConsider for example the security of infrastructure that supports energy provi -\nsion. The relationship between energy security and national security has grown in \nprominence in recent years, especially in the aftermath of Russia\u2019s renewed inva -\nsion of Ukraine in February  2022. A  number of incidents involving disruptions \nin Russian gas supplies to Europe, oil theft by Somali pirates, terrorist attacks on \npipelines in Iraq, nuclear reactor shutdowns and extreme fuel price volatility have \ngarnered much media attention ( Cornell, 2009 ). The Obama Administration put \nenergy security at the centre of its security agenda. NATO has entered the energy \nsecurity space, affirming the Alliance\u2019s role at the Bucharest Summit in 2008 and \nlaunching a \u2018Green Defence\u2019 initiative in 2014 \u2013 a more than symbolic expansion \nof interests and competences for an intergovernmental alliance created to thwart \nSoviet tanks and missiles ( NATO, 2020 ). Conventional energy security threats \nexist in physical space; accordingly, governments have direct means to exercise \ntheir jurisdictional controls on them. Authorities can inflict financial penalties on \nthe Russian government, deploy naval assets to combat Somali pirates or assign \nsecurity details to protect pipeline installations. Whatever the source of the threats \u2013  \nother states, unaffiliated culprits or unbridled market forces \u2013 governments by and \nlarge retain supremacy in their ability to provide energy security relative to other \nactors (which is not to say that states are able to do so absolutely; the argument \nhere is relative).\nThe security of private infrastructure against cyber threats presents a different \npicture, however. Utility companies such as electric power and gas providers are \nespecially vulnerable to them, for three reasons. One involves the threat actors: \nthey are varied, numerous and growing \u2013 cybercriminals seeking economic spoils, \nstates wanting to disrupt an adversary\u2019s society or economic activity by disrupting \nits power supplies, political hacktivists interested in expressing dissent through the \ndisruption of public works, etc. Second is the infrastructure\u2019s expanding network \nsurface. Private utility companies increasingly connect the industrial controllers \nthat govern component parts of energy facilities to the Internet, notably via the \nintroduction of \u2018smart meters\u2019 to build \u2018smart grids\u2019. The data connections transmit \ndata on energy consumption, deliver updates on contractual services and monitor \nsupply connectivity ( Energy Digital , 2020 ). They also, however, multiply the vec -\ntors of entry into and attack against those systems by nefarious external actors \u2013 as \noccurred, for example, in the penetration of the control system of a water treatment \nfacility in Florida in 2021, an episode whose provenance and method of action \nthe FBI and Secret Service have struggled to identify ( Greenberg, 2021 ; Line, \nT\u00f8ndel,  & Jaatun, 2011 ; Otuoze, Mustafa,  & Larik, 2018 ). And third, whether \nor not the systems are connected to the Internet, they are also growing in techni -\ncal intricacy. It would be misguided to claim that growing systems complexity \naids security on the basis that it increases the work factor of aspiring attackers \n(Singer  & Friedman, 2014 ), who must map out more interconnecting parts (e.g. \nmobile engineering stations to reprogram industrial controllers) which are gov -\nerned by labyrinthine and customised (rather than generic) operating software. For \n\n62 Lucas Kello\nthe same reason, the costs to defenders also go up and relatively more, because \nthey have more vulnerabilities to identify, interpret and mitigate as well as more \nintricacies to analyse (whereas attackers need to master only their chosen meth -\nods). To illustrate, the Stuxnet worm\u2019s 15,000 lines of code exploited six major \ntechnical and design flaws in the industrial control environment of the nuclear \nfacility in Natanz, Iran \u2013 whereas the attackers (reportedly US and Israeli govern -\nment hackers) had only to grasp the vulnerabilities they wished to exploit and \ndesign the computer code to exploit them. At least against the most sophisticated \nadversaries, then, modern infrastructure protection is a realm that strongly favours \nattackers over defenders ( Kello, 2013 ).\nIn many national jurisdictions, the major energy companies are investor owned. \nIn the United States, for example, about 75% of utility companies are private. Prob -\nlems of cybersecurity are therefore compounded: national security planners must \ncontend not only with attackers who enjoy the advantages of an operational envi -\nronment skewed in favour of the offence, but also with the obstacles of a defence \nlandscape that is fragmented between the private sector and the public sector. \nRecent security breaches illustrate these defensive woes. In the first known cyber -\nattack against the US power grid in September  2019, attackers exploited weak -\nnesses in the web interface of a vendor\u2019s firewall to create a blind spot in the grid \ncontrol centre and its associated power generation sites, resulting in a denial of \nservice in multiple remote sites. The incident exposed the complexities of supply \nchain vulnerabilities. Authorities must contend not just with infrastructure opera -\ntors who are customarily reluctant to invite external players into their networks, \nbut also with the diffused networks of private vendors whose lax security practices \nexist beyond the ability of the government to monitor.\nThe financial sector provides another example of partial state absence in private \nsector cybersecurity. Here, again, we can distinguish conventional security from \ncybersecurity. Governments wield enormous powers of regulatory oversight in the \nmanagement of ordinary financial affairs. They control the issuance and exchange \nof securities, they clear the listing of company stocks whose sale they also regulate, \nthey levy taxes and control vast treasuries, and they set bank lending rates through \nwhich they shape the contours of the macroeconomy in which private firms oper -\nate. The point is not that any single state or group of states can firmly control \nglobal or even national financial affairs; merely that states as a class of actor  in the \ninternational system enjoy broad supremacy relative to private organisations and \nindividuals.\nThe situation in cyberspace is very different: state involvement in financial sec -\ntor security is limited. Take for example the theft by North Korean military hackers \nof $81  million from the Bangladesh Central Bank \u2013 the largest virtual bank heist in \nhistory. In February  2016, operatives of the \u2018Lazarus Group\u2019, a murky and highly \nspecialised hacking unit of the Korean People\u2019s Army, remotely disabled the print -\ners used to issue monetary transfers at the Bangladeshi Central Bank. The attackers \nthen routed $951  million to various banks and organisations in Asia, exploiting a \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  63\nvulnerability in the messaging protocol of the SWIFT global payments system \u2013 \na private network of more than 10,000 member institutions that routs more than \n30 million financial transactions each day. Alerted by the hackers\u2019 misspelling of \nbasic words (e.g. \u2018fandation\u2019 instead of \u2018foundation\u2019) and references to flagged \nterms (e.g. \u2018Jupiter\u2019, an oil tanker under US embargo), authorities at the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York stopped or reversed the transfer of most of the stolen \nfunds. Filipino prosecutors also succeeded in prosecuting the manager of the Rizal \nBank from which some of the stolen funds were withdrawn.\nThe case illustrates both the strengths \u2013 in the physical world \u2013 and the limita -\ntions \u2013 in the virtual world \u2013 of the state\u2019s ability to protect financial systems. The \nstate\u2019s legal grip on the global financial pipelines and the power of its domes -\ntic courts enabled authorities to recover most of the stolen funds and to punish \nsome of the culprits (the main thieves in Pyongyang were beyond reach). Yet the \ngovernments involved had few powers to defend the banking network from the \nhackers\u2019 manoeuvres in the first place. The problem again was one of defence frag -\nmentation: because the authorities in Bangladesh, New York, and elsewhere were \nunable to conduct passive defence measures within the targeted banking network, \nauthorities could rely only on post-attack active defence measures to punish and \nrecover the funds seized by the hackers and their accomplices. Here again, how -\never, the state is not fully absent: it cooperates closely with private sector actors in \nthe assessment and remediation of threats \u2013 even if the state\u2019s presence is rarely felt \nwithin the private networks that manage the trillions of dollars of daily financial \nflows across the world.\nState Absence in National Security Provision\nThe second manifestation of state absence in cybersecurity involves the state\u2019s own \ncore security interests: it is increasingly less able to protect them without meaning -\nful private sector involvement. The problem is theoretically consequential. Recall \nWaltz\u2019 maxim about state autonomy, especially in the realm where states are most \njealous of their freedom of action \u2013 national security. We can observe the problem \nin two empirical contexts, antiterrorism and information security.\nTerrorisms ranks highly among national security threats in much of the world. \nNations have invested billions of dollars and initiated wars to attempt to eradicate \nit.9 Thus, it is notable when a private corporation is able single-handedly to impede \nthe government\u2019s attempts to carry out the fight.\nSuch a scenario occurred in the aftermath of the terrorist shooting in San Ber -\nnardino, California in December  2015. Following the mass shooting, the FBI pre -\nsented Apple with a court order to decrypt the mobile phone of one of the two \ndeceased shooters. The phone was cryptographically scrambled; without access \nto its contents, the authorities could not ascertain important details of the anti -\nterror investigation, such as the identities of possible accomplices. Apple execu -\ntives refused to abide by the government\u2019s order to decipher the phone\u2019s contents, \n\n64 Lucas Kello\narguing that this would erode the security of the entire iPhone ecosystem, thereby \nthreatening the privacy rights of millions of customers (including against the \nthreat of government surveillance). Apple CEO Tim Cook explained in a much-  \ncelebrated blogpost:\nWe have great respect for the professionals at the FBI, and we believe their \nintentions are good. Up to this point, we have done everything that is both within \nour power and within the law to help them. But now the U.S. government has \nasked us for something we simply do not have, and something we consider too \ndangerous to create. They have asked us to build a backdoor to the iPhone. .  . . \nAnd while the government may argue that its use would be limited to this case, \nthere is no way to guarantee such control.\n(Cook, 2016 )\nThe highly public nature of the company\u2019s response and the importance it gave to \nconsumer interests suggest that its main motives for resisting the government were \ncommercial more than ethical or political.10\nFor a short time, a large private company was in a position to dictate to the most \npowerful government in the world which of two seemingly competing goods \u2013 the \npublic good of privacy (aligned with the private  good of corporate income) and the \npublic good of security against terrorism. In the end, the FBI reportedly cracked \nthe phone with the assistance of a small Israeli company. That the government \nprevailed, then, is no score for statist sympathies: it overcame the resistance of one \nprivate company to assist in a matter of national security significance by secur -\ning the support of another private company that was more amenable to the state\u2019s \ndesires. Although the government won the battle over the contents of the terrorist\u2019s \niPhone, neither side decisively won the grander conceptual struggle for mastery in \nthe balance of players.\nAnother area of partial but growing state absence in national security involves \ninformation security within the democratic polity. Here, too, the distinction between \nthe physical and virtual worlds breaks down. Prevailing security doctrine privileges \nthe physical world over the virtual world. The Western conception of cybersecurity \nreflects this prejudice: it gives more weight to the protection of physical infra -\nstructure, the material interests it supports, and the geographic territory in which it \nresides than to the security of information exchange or information itself. It is an \nartifact of a previous era in which the cohesion of the polity relied fundamentally \non the integrity of the national soil. Spies and other foreign intruders, to be sure, \ncould affect domestic political affairs, but nowhere near the extent of influence that \nis possible with remote manoeuvres within digital information spaces.\nBy contrast, Russian and Chinese conceptions of cybersecurity prioritise infor -\nmation security, or efforts to protect the integrity of (or to control) domestic infor -\nmation flows via the Internet, rather than infrastructure security ( Segal, 2019 ). To \n\nThe State in the Digital Era  65\nthis end, the governments of both nations operate a vast apparatus of Internet sur -\nveillance and censorship that involves measures of both information control (to \nstem the flow of undesirable views) and information dissemination (to fan desir -\nable ones). The two activities go hand in hand: suppressing Internet content entails \nan ability to monitor it and its users. Although one can surveil information and \nusers without censoring them, one cannot censor without surveilling. Accordingly, \nRussian authorities operate the System of Operative Search Measures (SORM), \nnow in its third generation, which in collaboration with the national Internet service \nproviders captures online data almost completely. Recent legislation supports the \ncollection of information. In 2016, the Russian Duma passed two bills \u2013 collec -\ntively known as \u2018Yarovaya\u2019s Law\u2019 after one of its conceivers \u2013 requiring ISPs to \nstore user\u2019s metadata and content for varying periods of time. Censorship tactics \nare robust and involve not just Internet blockages, but also disruptive cyberattacks \nagainst the websites and machines of domestic political dissidents: for example, \nthe distributed denial of service attacks against the radio station Ekho Moskvy \nand the vote monitoring organisation Golos during the 2011 parliamentary election \n(Soldatov, 2012 ).11 China for its part operates a more stringent censorship machin -\nery. Its most prominent tool is the so-called Great Firewall, which blocks access to \nTwitter, Facebook, Google and Western Internet services ( Weber, 2019 ).\nIn the world of autocracies, then, the statist prejudice of theory lives strong in \nthe virtual realm of information security. But here we must insert a caveat: the \nenormous efforts undertaken by Beijing to retain control over its domestic informa -\ntion space belies a concern over the presence of forces that seek to evade such con -\ntrol but which the government cannot supremely suppress \u2013 or else the pervasive \ncontrols would not be necessary in the first place. More than just primary, if not \nquite supreme, the state\u2019s role in information security seems only to grow firmer as \nnew instruments and methods of population surveillance emerge.\nDemocratic societies experience a different form of confusion: not about politi -\ncal ideals (the commitment to basic democratic values is overall robust) but about \nthe veracity of important information and events within political discourse. Vari -\nous kinds of information integrity have come under assault from foreign influence \noperations: information about the views of political candidates, about the actions of \nofficials, about the policies and activities of government agencies and departments, \nand perhaps most damaging of all about the reliability of outcomes in the most \nfundamental democratic institution \u2013 elections.\nThe Western security agenda must give greater attention to information secu -\nrity. Information security is no longer the concern mainly of authoritarian nations \nwhose regimes strive to preserve their legitimacy against the grievances of con -\nfused citizens. It is also a legitimate interest of liberal democracies. Its scope must \nexpand beyond the normal concern of stemming illicit activity such as financial \nfraud. Containing malicious political and social content deserves security planner\u2019s \ngreater attention. Such threats affect the minds not of machines (as Marvin Minsky \n\n66 Lucas Kello\nput it) but of humans: information campaigns via social media or web postings that \nseek to sow confusion or division about the legitimacy of political candidates or the \ncoting outcome by disseminating either false information or truthful information \nthat is presented in a misleading manner.\nFor liberal democratic states, however, information security is a severely \nconscribed realm: their role is neither supreme nor even primary ( Kello, 2022 ). \nInformation control does not come naturally to societies that regard freedom of \nexpression as a fundamental right. The Russian hacking during the 2016 US presi -\ndential election showed that the very openness which defines the democratic politi -\ncal culture makes Western nations especially vulnerable to foreign information \ncampaigns. Democracies struggle with a fundamental tension that spares autocra -\ncies: how to protect the integrity of political discourse without violating freedoms \nof expression through over-regulation of social media platforms. The challenge of \ninformation governance is complicated by the fact that the platforms are designed, \nowned and operated by private companies (e.g. Facebook and Twitter) which are \nlargely free from government control. The need to involve them at the centre of \nregulatory efforts is another hurdle that autocracies do not face. Yet private sec -\ntor interests will not always align with the government\u2019s, as demonstrated in the \nApple-FBI dispute.\nState Pushback: Supremacy Versus Democratic Freedoms\nMasters of a realm they have dominated for centuries, states have not always \nyielded willingly to their supremacy\u2019s erosion in core areas of national life. They \nstrenuously resist curtailments of autonomy from foreign powers. Why would they \nnot do the same against actors residing within the state box?\nState pushback has been most decisive and successful within autocratic regimes. \nUnencumbered by constitutional constraints against surveillance, censorship and \nphysical repression, they can suppress private players who aspire to more than \nrelevance within the rigid box of the state \u2013 even if it requires, first, creating a \nstatist enclosure for an originally borderless Internet by coercing service providers \nand technology companies whose employees, after all, inhabit the physical virtual \nworld. But the liberal sovereign must be cautious. The repressive option is unten -\nable: suppress private actors too tightly and there is a risk of violating the basic \nfreedoms that underpin the state\u2019s legitimacy as master of the political system. In \na democracy, surveillance and censorship measures have an innate propensity to \nbackfire because they pit the ultimate goal of freedom with the ultimate goal of \nsecurity. In 2013, following popular revulsion at Edward Snowden\u2019s disclosure \nof NSA Internet mass surveillance activities that encompassed at least part of the \nUS population, Google raced to encrypt the torrents of data that flowed through \nits many data centres and services ( Timberg, 2013 ). State assertion thus provoked \nprivate sector retrenchment.\n\nThe State in the Digital Era  67\nOne \u2018soft\u2019 attempt at pushback in the realm of infrastructure protection is the \nBritish government\u2019s \u2018active cyber defence\u2019 initiative. Not to be confused with the \nAmerican version of the concept on which the discussion above was based, which \nis coercive and targets foreign actors, the British version is co-optive and support -\nive and it involves the domestic population. Launched in 2018, it carves out for the \nnational government a coordinating role in the strengthening of threat awareness \nand mitigation among the private sector and civil society. It \u2018aspires to protect the \nmajority of people in the UK from the majority of the harm, caused by the majority \nof the attacks, for the majority of the time\u2019 ( U.S. Department of Defense, 2015 ). \nOrganisationally, it expanded the arm of the government in private sector security \nby establishing, within the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a \nNational Cyber Security Centre. Among its manifold tasks and activities, a few are \nespecially notable for us: the vulnerability reporting service, an \u2018exercise in a box\u2019 \nservice that offers realistic crisis scenario planning, suspicious email reporting, and \nmost boldly a \u2018takedown service\u2019 that immediately removes malicious computer \ntraffic before harm occurs. True to democratic form, the services \u2013 and the atten -\ndant government involvement in private security affairs \u2013 are strictly voluntary. \nIts reach is therefore limited owing to an internal limitation: the very sensitivity \nof infrastructure and financial institutions that makes them rich targets for attack \nalso increases the private defenders\u2019 sensitivity to government involvement in the \ndefensive effort.\nMore difficult has been state responses to politically motivated information \nthreats: they have not gone far. These threats are especially difficult for authorities \nin liberal democracies to address. Different to cyberattacks and cyberespionage \noperations that involve malicious actors\u2019 penetration of closed systems, informa -\ntion warfare operations entail manoeuvres within open environments where the \nfree flow of data is encouraged. Regulatory thrusts that seek to hold large social \nmedia providers such as Facebook and Twitter to account for information threats \non their platforms have stalled owing to fears of curbing free expression and hin -\ndering innovation.\nA cynical mind might also point to the intense lobbying efforts (almost $500  mil-\nlion in 2019) that the seven largest companies direct at lawmakers ( Romm, 2020 ). \nBritain has proposed giving the telecommunications watchdog, Ofcom, the power \nto enforce a \u2018duty of care\u2019 on social media companies. Companies that fail to \nremove malicious content face fines. The move however is not decisive; it dis -\nplays the customary lightness of the democratic ethos by not banning platform \nusers themselves and by ceding to the Internet provides the prerogative of deciding \nwhat material to strike. In 2018, Germany introduced a new law \u2013 \u2018NetzDG\u2019 \u2013 that \nforces content providers to establish adjudication procedures to review complaints \nagainst hosted content. Fines can climb as high as \u20ac5  million \u2013 a rounding error for \nlarge companies whose balance books operate in the billions of euros. Perhaps the \nmost robust regulatory effort has unfolded within the European Union. In 2018, the \n\n68 Lucas Kello\nEuropean Commission implemented a strict private data control regime (the Gen -\neral Data Protection Regulation, or \u2018GDPR\u2019) and, in 2020, it proposed a new set of \ndata governance rules that would increase citizens\u2019 ownership of their private data \n(European Commission, 2020 ). That the strongest regulatory thrust in the world \nhas emerged within supranational structures is a partial victory for the state in the \nbattle for relative actor supremacy, for while the EU is not a state (to the chagrin \nof radical federalists), it is nevertheless an amalgamation of state powers and func -\ntions; it is at least a statist creature.\nIn the face of the government\u2019s reluctance to reassert its security role, what has \nemerged in the information space is a self-regulatory regime. For example, in the \nsummer of 2019, Google removed almost nine million videos from its YouTube \nplatform. Similarly, Facebook\u2019s \u2018Reality Check\u2019 function struck 30  million items \nin the same period. Both of these protective services utilised algorithms to remove \nthe vast majority of potentially harmful content. Yet another class of actor, then, \nhas joined the contest in the balance of players \u2013 private and semi-autonomous \nmachine regulators.\nConclusion\nIn proclaiming the state\u2019s dissolution within the liquefier of unrestricted computer \ncode, Perrow believed that he spoke from (more than just for) the future. The future \nhas since arrived; it has not heeded his proclamation. The state remains a central \nplayer in cyberspace and beyond it in areas of national life entwined with it. But \nnor does the current situation conform with the dogma of state centrism that domi -\nnates much of international relations thinking. The central tendencies of cyberse -\ncurity require that preconceived theories of international relations which privilege \nthe state above all other actors \u2013 sometimes to their exclusion \u2013 to catch up with \nthe facts. Vanished is the time when states could provide the security of vital infra -\nstructure in core areas of the economy and society without meaningful private sec -\ntor participation. Gone, too, is the era when the government could independently \nsecure the private sector from all relevant threats.\nTheorists\u2019 reaction to these developments must reflect both the growing heteroge -\nneity of the international system and the implications of technological change for that \nsystem. As vital societal functions rely increasingly on the instructions of machines \nand code, as democratic political discourse moves onto remote digital platforms, \nas adversaries find more ingenious ways to operate within cyberspace to threaten \nnational security \u2013 in short, as security interests and threats acquire an increasingly \ndigital form \u2013 theorists must give greater credence to the happenings of the virtual \nworld of politics. It is a world in which inexorably, if not yet decisively, actors alien \nto the states system grow in relevance and acquire the features of primacy in defi -\nance of the familiar masters. States have begun to push back \u2013 often successfully \u2013  \nagainst the intrusions of new agents upon their sovereignty. Theorists, however, \n cannot push back against the new empirical reality; our duty is to study, not resist it.\n\nThe State in the Digital Era  69\nNotes\n 1 This form of fundamental change can be labelled \u2018first order technological revolution\u2019 \n(Kello, 2017 , Chapter  6).\n 2 See the Introduction chapter of this edited volume.\n 3 As Clark explained, numerous papers proposed the creation of a capa bility to distinguish \nauthenticated and unauthenticated data traffic in the context of defeating DDoS attacks, \nincluding new fields in the data packet header, new router functions and new connec -\ntion protocols. See Anderson, Roscoe, and Wetherall (2004 ); Clark (2018 ); Parno et  al. \n(2007 ); Yaar, Perrig, and Song (2003 ).\n 4 For example, in 2019, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called for \u2018a more active role\u2019 \nfor governments and regulators, including new legislation for \u2018protecting elections\u2019 \nagainst foreign interference by the company\u2019s social media platform ( Press Association, \n2019 ).\n 5 For this reason, some threat intelligence researchers have called for the reform of the \nlaw. See Reforming the Computer Misuse Act 1990  (2020 ).\n 6 Even Kenneth Waltz accepted their occasional importance. See Waltz (1979 , pp. 93\u201394).\n 7 This is not the place for a detailed discussion of state centrism in IR and its critics. For \nuseful explorations of this debate, see Hobson (2000 ) and Lacher (2003 ).\n 8 Even in this realm, however, new blockchain technologies, which enable distributed, \ndecentralised and trustless exchanges of value, threaten to upend the global payments \nnetwork dominated by SWIFT, a private organisation that broadly conforms with the \nedicts of governments and their courts (e.g., in the implementation of government \nsanctions).\n 9 The US intelligence community places it atop the hierarchy of concerns (below cyber \nthreats). Britain classifies it as a \u2018tier 1\u2019 threat (also alongside cyber threats). Some scep -\ntics, however, have dismissed the gravity of the terrorist threat against Western security \n(Mueller, 2006 ).\n 10 When government and private industry choose to cooperate in security matters, effi -\nciencies and effectiveness can be gained \u2013 as in, for example, the US government\u2019s \ncooperation with Facebook, Twitter and Google to stem politically disruptive Russian \ninformation operations. See Sanger and Perlroth (2020 ).\n 11 For an excellent account of internet suppression in Russia, see Soldatov and Borogan \n(2015 ).\nReferences\nAdamsky, D. P. (2008).

Arguably, software programmers, \nalgorithm writers, Artificial Intelligence (AI) designers, digital network engineers, \ncomputer system administrators and other \u2018computer nerds\u2019 have tremendous \npower in the global information society. These types of experts and epistemic com -\nmunities design, build, develop, monitor, augment and analyse computer networks, \nalgorithms and \u2018Big Data\u2019 upon which contemporary politics, civil society and \neconomies depend. Government officials, policy-makers in international organisa -\ntions, corporate decision-makers and civil society leaders impact the shaping of \nglobal agendas and structuring of world politics. These types of elite leaders, how -\never, are regulating  and using  rather than creating  or connecting  the digital appli -\ncations and computer networks upon which contemporary post-industrial societies \ndepend. Digitalised communications and infrastructure do not simply exist \u2018out \nthere\u2019, as some kind of independent and rapidly evolving machine complex. Dig -\nital communications and infrastructure are human creations, including machine \nlearning and AI technologies. What then is the power of those that design, create \nand manage the software and hardware of global information society? What is the \nmeaning and significance of \u2018nerd power\u2019, that is, the power of the omnipresent yet \ntypically behind-the-scenes computer expert? Addressing these overarching ques -\ntions is essential if we are to fully understand the nature and implications of \u2018digital \ndisruptions\u2019 of the innovation-oriented contemporary world. Conceptualising nerd \npower, we contend, further develops the conceptual framework presented by Bjola \nand Kornprobst in the introductory chapter to this volume by placing a particular 3\nRISE OF THE NERD\nKnowledge, Power and International Relations  \nin a Digital World\nGiampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\n\n74 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\ntype of agential processes  in focus, in the form of computer experts whose designs \nand constructs result in datafication, heightened speed and increased pervasiveness \nof both technology and contemporary social and international relations.\nHence, the present chapter asks: what is the nature of \u2018nerd power\u2019; how can \nthe rise of \u2018nerd power\u2019 be explained; and what are the wider implications of \u2018nerd \npower\u2019? As elaborated on herein, \u2018nerd power\u2019 is dispersed yet omnipresent in every \naspect of global society. Moreover, we contend that while there are a few famous \n(or infamous) computer nerds (Bill Gates, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden \nbeing the most obvious contemporary examples), the computer nerd tends to act \nbehind the scenes of political decision-making. In addition, we suggest that there \nare three different forms of nerd power \u2013 design power , connecting power and ana -\nlytical power. These forms of power are part of what Bjola and Kornprobst refer \nto as agential processes, which also sustain technological and ordering processes.\nThe study of the power of individuals is certainly not new in IR. In the classi -\ncal realism of Morgenthau, Niebuhr and others, \u2018statesmen\u2019 (who were predomi -\nnately if not exclusively men) figure prominently as key decision-makers on the \nworld stage \u2013 Churchill, Gandhi, and Eisenhower on the \u2018light side of the force\u2019 \u2013  \nand Hitler and Stalin as examples from the \u2018dark side\u2019. Likewise, Machiavelli \nwrote his strategic pieces of advice to \u2018the Prince\u2019 \u2013 an individual leader capable \nof seizing power in a state and defending it against foreign intruders and domestic \ninsurrectionists. Moreover, individual leadership, cognition and decision-making \nunder stress are studied in, for example, political psychology ( Horowitz, McDer -\nmott,  & Stam, 2005 ), international negotiations ( Malnes, 1995 ) and crisis manage -\nment ( Boin, \u2018t Hart, Stern,  & Sundelis, 2016 ). Further, there is multi-disciplinary \nresearch on the power of celebrities and \u2018super-entrepreneur\u2019 leaders such as Bill \nGates, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos ( Partzsch  & Fuchs, 2012 ).\nNotwithstanding, while Waltz in his original neorealist theory suggested three \nlevels of analysis \u2013 the individual, the state and the international system \u2013 IR has \nbeen dominated by studies focusing either on systemic and structural conditions, or \non states and non-state bodies as \u2018collective\u2019 actors, often invoking \u2018methodologi -\ncal individualism\u2019, that is, ascribing individual-psychological traits to states and \nother organisations (cf. Chapters  1 and 6 in this volume). Indeed, Waltz himself \nquickly dismissed the role of individuals in his Man, the State, and War . The role \nof actual individuals, then, has often been overlooked.\nMoreover, while individuals have been addressed in the past in parts of IR, this \nliterature is largely focused on highly visible, salient leaders in politics and busi -\nness. Whereas both demeaning and celebratory depictions of the computer nerd are \nabundant in popular culture, study of the arguably stereotypical computer nerd is \nnovel in IR, even if this category of actor has been around since the advent of com -\nputers and increasingly since the emergence of our digital society (Blaese, 2020; \nSell, 2013 ). Research on the stereotype of the science nerd in the cognitive behav -\nioural and life sciences has focused more on ethnicity than, for example, gender \n(Schinske, Cardenas,  & Kaliangara, 2015 ), despite the stark dominance of men in \n\nRise of the Nerd  75\nComputer Science as well as more generally in Science, Technology, Engineering \nand Maths (STEM) research and practice. Research shows prevailing and domi -\nnant male networks and communities of computer \u2018lads\u2019 (Fujii, 2021; H\u00e5pnes  & \nS\u00f8rensen, 2018 ; Kaygan, 2016 ; Klinger  & Svensson, 2021 ; Tassabehji et  al., 2020 ; \nTierney, 2018 ).\nEfforts at greater representation, through for example incorporating the Arts \nand Humanities into STEM-cum-STEAM education have made little headway in \naddressing the persistent lack of gender equality and diversity in these fields (Fujii, \n2021). According to the US National Science Foundation (NSF), computer science \nand engineering are the two STEM science fields with the lowest representation of \nwomen ranked as full professors, at 12% and 8%, respectively ( Dekelaita-Mullet, \n2021 , p. 84). We contend that the computer nerd stereotype \u2013 variously anchored to \nsome degree in empirics, reputation and celebration as stereotypes typically are \u2013 \nhas significant power in shaping global information society, something which begs \nscrutiny of this type of actor in IR. We do not intend the term \u2018nerd\u2019 to be pejorative \nand refer to lack of social skills, which is often the case in everyday discourse and \nin popular culture; rather, we consider a \u2018nerd\u2019 to be a highly dedicated, knowl -\nedgeable and skilled expert in a technical field \u2013 particularly computers ( Cam -\nbridge Dictionary, 2021 ).\nThe chapter is structured as follows. In the following section, we conceptualise \n\u2018nerd power\u2019 as a type of structural, or system-shaping power, specifically with \nregard to what we dub design power, connecting power and analytical power. Sub -\nsequently, we suggest explanations for the rise of nerd power, which has to do not \nonly with digital innovation and design, but also with ideas and decisions made \nin politics and business. Such decisions have enabled the development of global \ninformation society and propelled increasing dependence on digital infrastructure \nreliant on the (super)powers of the computer nerd. Finally, we discuss the impli -\ncations of nerd power in a \u2018fragmegrated\u2019 world (technologically integrated yet \npolitically and organisationally fragmented).\nComputer Nerds: Anonymous but Powerful\nSpecific focus on the power of computer experts is relatively rare in past research. \nAn exception is anthropologist John Postill; in his 2018  book The Rise of Nerd \nPolitics , Postill addresses the power of \u2018tech-savvy nerds\u2019, but the book is con -\ncerned only with digital activists \u2013 highly influential social media individuals \u2013 \nso-called \u2018influencers\u2019 working on crowdsourcing, privacy activism and political \nprotest. Whereas Postill acknowledges that some digital activists are also computer \nexperts \u2013 so-called \u2018hacktivists\u2019 ( Denning, 2001 ; Richards  & Wood, 2018 ; Sell, \n2013 ; Tanczer, 2017 ) they are seldom visible to the public, a feature evidenced in \nthe very name of the hacker network \u2018Anonymous\u2019 ( Richards  & Wood, 2018 ; Uit-\nermark, 2018). While the network is well-known, its members are not.1 The digital \nworld allows both heightened visibility and anonymity, but most computer experts \n\n76 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nhave not gained public attention, at least not beyond their relatively isolated epis -\ntemic communities. Moreover, the possibility of anonymity in a technical sense, \nparticularly regarding the endemic difficulty of identifying skilled actors behind \ncyber-attacks and the spread of digital malware, has been exploited by hacker \ngroups such as the Anonymous group which in 2012 brought down the website of \nthe American Federal Bureau of Investigation ( Olson, 2013 ). Indeed, it is not only \nthe savvy use of digital technology that matters, but in a deeper architectural sense, \ncode and the writers of computer code.\nPut simply, the work of computer nerds matters. Moreover, some nerds matter \nmore than others, depending on their skill and to what degree their designs are actu -\nally applied in the construction, launching and widespread adoption of computer \nsoftware, networks and praxis. To be sure, expertise in itself is not sufficient for \nmaking an impact on actual computer networks and their application in everything \nfrom military intelligence to finance, electricity, transport, telecommunications \nand other \u2018critical infrastructures\u2019. The history of technology is full of examples \nof proof-of-concept designs that haven\u2019t made it to mass production (e.g. Google \nglasses), many more inventions that have become outdated (e.g. the \u2018dumb\u2019 phone), \nand designs that excel in some regions and fail in others (flip or foldable phones \nwhich were favoured in North America and unsuccessful in Europe).\nWhat we are concerned with herein is the top echelon of computer nerds \u2013 \nthose with both necessary technological skills and knowledge on the one hand \nand those whose designs are actually adopted and employed in computer networks \nupon which post-industrial society is anchored. We are aware that some individual \ncomputer nerds have made a significant impact in global politics and business \u2013 \nnotably first-generation computer nerds who developed some of the original \u2018Big \nTech\u2019 companies, such as Microsoft\u2019s Bill Gates and Apple\u2019s Steve Jobs, as well \nas second-generation computer nerds who developed social media, notably Mark \nZuckerberg and his highly influential Facebook ( Moran, 2020 ). While Jobs is \nwidely seen as the man behind the iconic iPhone, Jobs\u2019 role was much more that of \nentrepreneur and business leader than tech expert. Much less known than Jobs is \nEric Arthur Johnston, the engineer who already in the 1960s developed the touch \nscreen, which is a defining feature of the iPhone and all other smartphones ( Hayes, \n2018 ). In short, while a handful of computer nerds have gained visibility as well as \nsignificant political and economic power, most computer nerds do not achieve that \nkind of visibility or significant agenda-shaping or economic power .\nHence, computer nerds exercise a largely silent and faceless form of power. The \nanonymity of computer nerds is certainly intentional in the case of hackers con -\nducting computer break-ins and spreading malicious code (which is not our main \nobject of study). Relative obscurity is common also for writers of social media \nalgorithms, AI designers, 5G network engineers and computer system administra -\ntors \u2013 the type of actors we are mainly concerned with herein. Yet, the power of the \nlatter more obscure and \u2018benign\u2019 type of computer nerd is as significant as that of \n\nRise of the Nerd  77\nthe hacker, if not more so, particularly through their system-shaping capabilities. \nNotably, the anonymity of \u2018benign\u2019 computer nerds is not typically intentional. \nThis anonymity may rather be the result of a general \u2018externalisation\u2019 of technology \nin society as well as in academic research \u2013 policy-makers, and other enthusiastic \nusers of digital technology, as well as much of the IR literature, tends to perceive \ntechnology as an object or impersonal force, rather than as something developed \nand designed by humans, with the purpose of satisfying particular needs and inter -\nests (Eriksson  & Giacomello, 2006; Eriksson  & Newlove-Eriksson, 2021; Fritsch, \n2014 ; Leese  & Hijtink, 2019 ). The widespread determinist conceptualisation \u2013 typ -\nically non-reflective \u2013 of a mechanistic, impersonal, neutral \u2018technological devel -\nopment\u2019 might be an important reason for why computer nerds \u2013 among other \ntechnical experts \u2013 are seldom considered as the powerful agents they in fact are.\nWhereas software programmers, network engineers, cyber-security specialists, \nAI designers and computer system administrators abound \u2013 not all of them are \nequally skilled or influential. Comprehensive data is lacking, but the limited lit -\nerature available (e.g. Akera, 2008 ; Ensmenger, 2012 ; Priestley, 2011 )2 suggests \nthat the overall number of highly skilled \u2018computer geniuses\u2019 is around a few \nthousand, most of them based in the United States and other advanced economies \nsuch as the UK, Germany, France and Australia. China is catching up however, \npartly through the commercial successes of TikTok, WeChat and Huawei\u2019s 5G \nnetwork. Notably, China has decided to phase out all Western technology from the \ncountry and make its government and society reliant entirely on homegrown tech -\nnology \u2013 as part of a new \u2018tech cold war\u2019 with the West ( Lyons, 2019 ). Further, \nChina aspires to become global leader in AI by 2030 and the sheer number of its \nuniversity graduates in computer science and engineering makes that a credible \npossibility. Similarly, the European Union (EU) has prioritised AI in its technolog -\nical strategy, through massive funding and setting the explicit goal of developing \na globally leading platform for \u2018AI on demand\u2019 ( Newlove-Eriksson  & Eriksson, \n2021 , pp. 48\u201349). Moreover, Russia is often considered the most successful insti -\ngator of information operations (IO) in history ( Ajir & Vailliant, 2018 ), and Israel \nhas made cybersecurity one of its top industrial sectors. India is also likely to \nfollow China\u2019s rapid development, thanks to India\u2019s massive pool of computer \nscience students and graduates.3\nThe power of computer nerds \u2013 individuals who are generally unknown to the \npublic and who lack the financial powers of super-entrepreneurs \u2013 rests rather on \ntheir ability to shape, develop and manage the digital systems used for global com -\nmunications, social media, financial transactions and digital infrastructures. Com -\nputer nerds do not make decisions on foreign or domestic policy, they do not sign \ninternational treaties, and they rarely give speeches to global audiences \u2013 but they \nshape digital parameters of policymaking, they shape how information is stored \nand disseminated, and they make it possible for people to connect and disconnect \nfrom each other. Thus, nerd power is largely a system-shaping type of power, rather \n\n78 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nthan any Robert Dahl kind of relational power where, for example, actor A  gets \nactor B to do what B otherwise would not have done.\nThe system-shaping power of nerds may thus be seen as a form of structural \npower. In IR however, structural power is viewed as the capability of states and \ninternational organisations to shape international norms and principles ( Baldwin, \n2016 , p. 81; Barnett  & Duvall, 2005 , pp. 52\u201355; cf. Chapters  1, 2 and 6 in this \nvolume), rather than how computer experts shape digital information and commu -\nnication systems. Yet recent research on how social media platforms, and how the \nalgorithms run by them, imply biases in what and how information is communi -\ncated may suggest that computer nerds not only set parameters of communication, \nbut also influence public discourse, including what norms and values gain more or \nless visibility ( Gillespie, 2018 ).\nWe have thus far argued that computer nerds are crucial to the development of \nthe contemporary digitalised world, that nerd power is largely a system-shaping \nrather than relational form of power, as well as observed that computer nerds have \nbeen surprisingly missing from scholarship on digitalisation and cyberspace, par -\nticularly in the IR literature. These observations are important, but also nonspe -\ncific. In an attempt to further identify the kind of power computer nerds exert, \nwe suggest three subtypes of nerd power: design power , connecting power , and \nanalytical power . Before discussing each of these types of nerd power, it should \nbe emphasised that while many computer experts specialise in only one of them, \nthose multi-skilled individuals that know how to write algorithms, design software, \ndetect bugs and hack into computer systems, build and connect computer networks, \nas well as manage and analyse \u2018Big Data\u2019 certainly have a competitive advantage. \nSuch combinations of skill and experience are easier to develop within teams of \ndifferent types of computer experts, which is what organisers of digital support and \ncybersecurity units of governmental and nongovernmental organisations comprise. \nThe subsequent section describes the three subtypes in more detail.\nDesign power  sets the parameters of what currently can and cannot be done \nwith software. By implication, software design also determines what can be done \nwith computerised hardware \u2013 such as drones, autopiloted airplane systems and \nself-driving cars. Designing an autonomous weapons system is definitely one of \nthe most pivotal design powers there is \u2013 that is, deciding what a weapons system \nwill recognise as a \u2018legitimate\u2019 target and determining how a weapon system makes \nthe decision to fire for effect. Designers are typically programmers and writers of \ncode, both for system software and for specific software applications. On a global \nlevel, designers of the TCP/Internet Protocol and DNS (the global Domain Name \nSystem) exercise unparalleled power in their field ( Eriksson  & Giacomello, 2009 ; \nHaugen, 2020 ). These computer experts, working under the auspices of ICANN \n(Internet Corporation for Names and Numbers) have designed the foundational \nroot system of the Internet. ICANN experts have, for example, designed the DNS \nin a combined territorial and organisational manner. This design power is not \nnecessarily shaping the behaviour of Internet users, but it inter alia  reiterates a \n\nRise of the Nerd 79\nparticular way of understanding the world, as divided into a number of categories, specifically territorial states, governments, civil society, business and educational institutions (cf. Chapters 1, 2 and 6 in this volume).\nDesign power can also be directly effectual, through for example design of soft -\nware applications, design of AI systems, and in the writing of algorithms. Algo -\nrithms are software codes that work to identify user data and exponentially seek to match that with particular alternatives. Algorithms are increasingly a core feature of digital life, through their extrapolations impacting how individuals make choices  \nregarding, for example, music, leisure activities, real estate, food, travel, medical assistance, financial investments and partner matchmaking (Bucher, 2018; Kot -\nliar, 2021). Algorithms are also used in digital surveillance systems, for example, in monitoring of Internet search patterns for ascertaining early warning of epi -\ndemic and pandemic outbreaks by centres of disease control (Bengtsson, 2019). Moreover, algorithms are increasingly used in public administration and political  \ndecision-making, in what is referred to as \u2018automated decision-making\u2019 in the  \npublic sector (Cobbe, 2019; Kaun, 2022).\nAlgorithms are also routinely used in, for example, Internet search engines \u2013 \nGoogle use is so widespread it has become a verb and synonym for search \u2013 and in social media such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, etc. (Thorson, 2020). Embedded in these applications, algorithms assemble and analyse search strings, social media profiles and other user data, nudging or redirecting users to specific websites, postings and other categories of information and services. Algorithms \nimply systemic \u2018confirmation bias\u2019, selecting opinions and beliefs that confirm and reinforce beliefs people already have, while ignoring critical opinions and facts that speak against their beliefs (Bucher, 2018; Saifee, 2020). This \u2018confirmation bias\u2019 can be the choice of writers of algorithms or depend on clients that have paid the social media company to steer the attention of users. Algorithms and their tendency to create \u2018opinion bubbles\u2019 in social media risk aggravating the spread of \u2018fake\u2019 and highly politicised news, further fuelling the negative development of \u2018post-truth\u2019 society and disinformation (Bucher, 2018; Iengar & Massey, 2019). Indeed, some observers claim algorithms use \u2018hyper nudging-techniques\u2019 to overtly persuade and covertly manipulate people to make certain choices rather than others (Kotliar, 2021; Reviglio & Agosti, 2020).\nEven when AI is involved in the construction and application of algorithms \u2013 for \nexample by arriving at novel results through extrapolative AI use \u2013 there are none -\ntheless experts behind the data who design and update AI, people who make deci -\nsions on what given AI applications are intended to do, and how what in a given circumstance is supposed to be done (Winfield, Michael, Pitt, & Evers, 2019). Moreover, AI is sometimes considered to be impartial, something not influenced by emotions or stakeholder interests (Hudson, 2019). Yet it can also be argued that there is risk of confirmation bias even in AI (Saifee, 2020), both dependent on the \noriginal design of AI technology, and on the specific machine learning properties of AI. Whereas it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine possible relations in \n\n80 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\ndetail, it is noteworthy that new constellations of subject and object and of human agency and knowledge production are implied in AI use.\nWhile most observers agree on the power of algorithms, it is seldom asked \nwhat power the writers  of algorithms and developers and designers of tech -\nnology may have. This knowledge gap is particularly noted within the field of IR, although the power of design has to a degree been addressed in Science and Technology Studies \u2013 STS (e.g. Akera, 2008; Albrechtslund, 2006; Ens -\nmenger, 2012; Felt, Fouch\u00e9, Miller, & Smith-Doerr, 2017; Priestley, 2011). In short, design power has two faces. First, the individuals and teams designing something have the power to decide what an application or gadget is supposed to do, how it does it and largely also for what purposes (e.g. a gun is ineffective for most other purposes besides shooting). Second, once a technological design (including those based on algorithms) is in place and being used, the design might have an impact on the behaviour and worldviews of people, states and organisations (Reviglio & Agosti, 2020; on structural power, Baldwin, 2016; Barnett & Duvall, 2005).\nConnecting power  refers to how tech nerds are the ones who actually build \nand connect computer networks, construct the systems of Internet Service Pro -\nviders (ISPs), manage the TCP/IP system and Domain Name System on behalf of ICANN, operate core routers, build 5G wireless networks (and the designing the forthcoming 6G technology) and set up satellite Internet communications (e.g. Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink project; Heaven, 2020). In so doing, these specialist nerds set \nthe parameters for who and what is included and excluded in communications net -\nworks, what the capacity of communications are, and also what and how systems are connected to other systems, so-called \u2018systems of systems [SoS] engineering\u2019 (Keating, Rogers, Unal, & Dryer, 2003). Such network experts effectively make \u2018Big Data\u2019 and the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 possible \u2013 a development sped up by high capacity 5G (Li, Xu, & Zhao, 2018; Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021). Impor -\ntantly, connecting power also implies the power to disconnect, to downscale and limit access to networks \u2013 knowledge and skills used in network security and in the setup of firewalls, encryption and other means of protection. Arguably, net -\nwork experts do not create an autonomous selection for decisions on who and what to include and exclude in a network, but rather strive to meet parameters for access and other goals set by their superiors \u2013 whether in the military, in public administration or in private business. Still, network experts \u2013 like experts in every \nfield \u2013 have a general advantage in that their superiors depend on their specialised knowledge and skills.\nAnalytical power , finally, refers herein to knowledge and understanding of how \nsoftware and computer networks function, and what their properties, strengths and weaknesses are. Analytical power is also about the capacity to process raw data and convert it into knowledge, that is, to identify patterns and suggest interpreta -\ntions of them. Analytical power is, for example, shown by the ability to detect and \n\nRise of the Nerd 81\ntrace cyber-attacks, and to detect and analyse software vulnerabilities and \u2018bugs\u2019. Analytical power is also related to the process of \u2018datafication\u2019, that is, the algo -\nrithmic treatment and machine-learning tracking, aggregation and de-aggregation and analysis of \u2018Big Data\u2019 (see Bjola & Kornprobst\u2019s introductory chapter to this volume; Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger & Cukier, 2013; Mejias & Couldry, 2019; Lycette, \n2013). Analytical power is thus also essential for the ability to conduct hacking into computer networks \u2013 to locate weak spots and \u2018backdoors\u2019, to navigate through \u2018systems of systems\u2019, and to decode encryption.\nConceptually, analytical power corresponds to Barnett and Duvall\u2019s notion of \n\u2018productive power\u2019, which is about discursive and meaning-making power (Bar -\nnett & Duvall, 2005, p. 55). A historical example of tech nerds with impressive analytical power are the Polish and British mathematicians and cryptologists who cracked the German Enigma cipher machine used before and during the Second World War. In the contemporary digital world, analytical power has arguably become even more pertinent, not least concerning encryption software, and it is thus essential for national security, which, according to Realism, is the sancta sanc-\ntorum  of sovereign states (Giacomello, 2005, Chapter 2; cf. Chapters 1 and 2 in this \nvolume). While design power is what makes applications and algorithms possible in the first place, and connecting power makes applications and algorithms come to use as applications in computer networks and digitalised critical infrastructure, analytical power makes it possible to understand the strengths and weaknesses of applications and algorithms, as well as to perceive patterns and inconsistencies in \ndata and software.\nBefore moving on to discuss what explains the rise of tech nerds, a comment \nis warranted regarding the intentionality of nerd power. Simply put, do nerds seek power beyond merely being able to do what their superiors tell them to do? To be sure, there are individuals and groups using and developing their computer knowledge and skills to have an impact on society and politics, for which they are neither popularly elected nor employed. It should also be acknowledged that the goals set by superiors may be more sinister than those of loyal tech nerds; consider for example the infamous Manhattan Project which developed the atomic bombs, technology which not only led to the killing of approximately 200,000 people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but also paved the way for nuclear deterrence as a grand strategy that shaped the bipolar system of the entire postwar era. A more contem -\nporary example of how tech nerds work for nefarious purposes is the Cambridge \nAnalytica scandal, revealed in March 2018. Cambridge Analytica was a British consultancy firm with staff skilled in computing and \u2018Big Data\u2019 analytics, which without authorisation collected personal data on more than 80 million Facebook users, data used both in the Brexit campaign in the UK and in Trump\u2019s 2016 US presidential election campaign. The firm and its parent company, which was dis -\nsolved soon after the revelation of the scandal, had also influenced election cam -\npaigns in several other countries.\n\n82 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nWhile hacking and hacktivism may entail actions that are intended to do harm \nand need to be taken seriously, we would like to emphasise the much more wide -\nspread impact of nerd power, which unlike hacking is not intentional or conspira -\ntorial but rather the sum of innumerable decisions taken over time in incremental code-writing, computer networking and technological analysis endeavours. Taken together, nerd power structures order the digital world. The cumulative power of tech decisions results not only in highly efficient telecommunications and digi -\ntalised infrastructure which enables real-time communication of vast amounts of data irrespective of geographical distance; importantly, these decisions have also resulted in highly interdependent and therefore vulnerable \u2018world risk society\u2019 (Beck, 1999), in which the sheer complexity of integrated technical systems imply unavoidability of \u2018normal accidents\u2019 (Perrow, 1999).\nWhat Explains the Rise of Nerd Power?\nHow then can the rise of nerd power be explained? The burgeoning significance of nerd power is an effect of the degree to which contemporary society has become reli -\nant on computing for both functional infrastructure and leisure activities. If finan -\ncial systems, transportation, telecommunications, electricity grids, industrial and food supply chains, healthcare and other \u2018critical infrastructures\u2019 did not depend on \ncomputer networks \u2013 then nerd power would be insignificant, and the relevance of expertise in the field likely confined to a hobby sector. Hence, given the increasing global dependency on digital infrastructure, nerd power is rising, ceteris paribus . \nThis proposition is as true as it is shallow; it does not tell us whether nerd power is similar everywhere, whether there are specific drivers that matter more than others, or whether there are distinct drivers for different types of nerd power. We suggest here three key drivers for the rise of nerd power, corresponding to design power, connecting power and analytical power. Further, we address the significance of techno-optimistic ideas in politics and business, as well as the importance of devel -\nopments in the private sector for the rise of all three forms of nerd power. Finally, we discuss why the power of computer nerds \u2013 as a specific category \u2013 is generally more significant than that of other tech nerds.\nFirst, design power is increasing as a result of the rapid increase in depend -\nency on a myriad of digital software applications and algorithms which guide and support everything from heavy machinery, advanced medical equipment, air traf -\nfic controls, military and search and rescue (SAR) drones, financial transactions, intelligence services, surveillance, and geo-engineering to political decision-  \nmaking, to our mundane but also high-tech mobile smartphones which have become highly integrated in the majority of daily lives from an early age. This observation corresponds to Bjola and Kornprobst\u2019s discussion of speed  as one of \nthe sources of \u2018digital disruption\u2019 (see the introductory chapter to this volume; Wajcman, 2015). Importantly, not only does the digital interconnectedness of previously analogue infrastructures imply real-time communication across vast \n\nRise of the Nerd 83\ngeographical distances, but this speed is also accelerating, particularly through the rollout of higher bandwidth 5G technology (Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021; Schwab, 2017).\nWhereas contemporary software designs are user-friendly, the underlying tech -\nnology is increasingly complex, requiring advanced expertise in code-writing and program design. Earlier software applications often required some basic under -\nstanding of code-writing, which for example was the case with respect to the orig-inal versions of the statistical software SPSS, which in its current user-friendly interface does not require more than very basic computer skills. Moreover, with the increasing dependency on algorithms in news media, social media and indeed in automated decision-making in military operations and public administration, the power of the code-writer undoubtedly grows, even where circumscribed by laws, policies and the expectations of superiors. With the increasing dependency on technical expertise in international regulation of a digitalised world, combined with the increasing complexity of technical systems and algorithm-driven systems, the influence of technical experts is generally growing. This has been observed in, for example, international standardisation processes (Demortain, 2008; Novak & Pavlicek, 2021).\nSecond, connecting power is increasing in significance as government and pri -\nvate sectors actively promote a process of digital interconnectedness of critical infrastructure and public services in the Internet of Things (IoT), which previ -\nously were analogue and operated independently of one another (Akaev & Pantin, \n2014; McCarthy, 2018; Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021). Smartphones are in themselves a microworld of multiple functions far surpassing that of a \u2018telephone\u2019; the next step, if techno-optimists in business and government are to decide, is the development of efficiency-driven digitalised and interconnected \u2018smart homes\u2019 and \u2018smart cities\u2019. This major global digitalised integration goes further than the preceding information technology revolution, which mainly concerned the global spread of the Internet (Castells, 1996; Rosenau & Singh, 2002). Importantly, this new digital interconnectedness entails not merely a shift in communications, but in how both information and a whole array of physical, social, economic, political and biological systems are integrated, which relates to \u2018pervasiveness\u2019 as one of the key sources of \u2018digital distruption\u2019 (see the introductory chapter to this volume by Bjola and Kornprobst; cf. Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021). Indeed, the human body is not exempt from digitalisation.\nBiometric face recognition has existed for many years, and for example, embed -\nded sensor technology for recognition of voices and walking patterns \u2013 that is, the \u2018gait\u2019 \u2013 of individuals is also well under development. More intrusive \u2018cyborglike\u2019 technologies are also coming into use, such as microchips implanted under the skin of individuals, which use personalised Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags for ID and credit, and can be used for transportation ticketing, to give just \none example (Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021, pp. 34\u201335). Less controversial biotech applications are those used to treat, for example, diabetes and other serious \n\n84 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nchronic illnesses. Notably, such identification and surveillance technologies are increasingly interconnected in digital networks, through compressed cyber trans -\nmission of sensor-enabled multiple-source information, \u2018ubiquitous\u2019 technology processes sped up by higher bandwidth 5G. With the dissemination of high-speed 5G wireless technology, the \u2018IoT\u2019 is no longer simply an idea, but a reality. Accord -\ning to the Ericsson corporation, a leading 5G developer, in 2021 approximately 28 billion  \u2018smart devices\u2019 were connected with the help of sensors and rapid trans -\nmission across the world. What the implications of this will be for international relations remains to be seen; the rather sparse IR literature on 5G to date concerns primarily security implications with respect to China and the West regarding Hua -\nwei; many observers in the West fear, for example, Huawei\u2019s use of 5G technology for espionage on behalf of the Chinese government (R\u00fchlig & Bj\u00f6rk, 2020).\nThird, analytical nerd power is increasing in significance due to tremendous \nadvances in \u2018Big Data\u2019 and quantum computing, that is, what Bjola and Korn -\nprobst identity as the first source of \u2018digital disruption\u2019 (see the introduction to this volume by Bjola and Kornprobst; Lee, 2017; Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger & Cukier, 2013; Mejias & Couldry, 2019). While analytical power is largely the result of computer research and development, it would not imply much power unless the demand for Big Data number crunching had risen equally fast, in every part of government, industry and society. In business, the use of Big Data is becoming more diverse and widespread, for purposes such as trend forecasting in market analysis, and for specific statistical analysis in everything from agriculture, spatial planning, crowd \ncontrol and mining and retail (Lee, 2017). It has been argued, however, that for Big Data to become a core tool in business strategy and management, a change in business culture is also required: \u2018You can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure\u2019 (McAfee & Brynjolffson, 2012, p. 4) sums up this techno-behaviourist attitude.\nAdvocates of Big Data also emphasise that it is not just another word for \u2018sta -\ntistical analysis\u2019, but that it implies pivotal changes in volume (from gigabyte to zettabyte), velocity (rapid insight on for example the geographical location patterns of mobile phones), and variety (everything from GPS signals to sensor readings and social media postings (McAfee & Brynjolffson, 2012, pp. 4\u20135). What the Big \nData and quantum computing revolution do then, is promise a leap from relying on \u2018hunches and clues\u2019 to \u2018reliable data\u2019. Whether such a change is actually tak -\ning place is however questionable. Increased reliance on Big Data may very well satisfy an emotional need for control, without really answering the most important \nquestions for decision-makers in business, government and civil society. In par -\nticular, whereas Big Data may give you the \u2018big picture\u2019, highlighting dominant patterns and most likely outcomes, it tends to miss deviating or outlier cases, the out-of-ordinary (Eriksson & Giacomello, 2013). In risk analysis, the less likely but more consequential (e.g. a solar storm causing a global power blackout) is equally if not more important than the most likely outcome. Notably, Big Data also has \nimplications for national security, which is particularly noteworthy in increasingly digitalised intelligence analysis.\n\nRise of the Nerd 85\nIn addition to change in the demand and supply of digital technology, ideas also \nmatter as drivers of technological change and nerd power. In particular, techno-optimistic, determinist ideas fuel the development of the global information soci -\nety. These ideas, based on modernisation theory and which are reminiscent of the Enlightenment, suggest that technological innovation is germane for coping with societal, environmental and political challenges (Dai & Hao, 2018; Sokolova, Troyanskaya, & Glavatskikh, 2020). The impact of technological optimism is evi -\ndenced by the widespread belief in evolutionary societal development, where both individuals and society as a whole get \u2018smarter\u2019 by way of technological revolu -\ntions. Not only are people regularly using \u2018smart\u2019 phones for a large part of every -\nday activities, but political and business leaders are also advocating \u2018smart homes\u2019, \u2018smart cities\u2019 and even a \u2018smart future\u2019 (Lee & Trimi, 2018; Newlove-Eriksson & Eriksson, 2021, pp. 36\u201337). The \u2018smart\u2019 label strongly implies that digitalisa -\ntion and interconnectivity are considered fundamental for societal and economic progress. Notably, dangers of such a technologically attuned and dependent risk society tend to be downplayed or dealt with separately from national strategies of technology and industry, where ministers even hold dual portfolios such as energy and digitalisation (e.g. former Swedish minister Anders Ygeman) signifying opti -\nmistic technological determinism. Moreover, it remains an open question as to who, what and how something is seen as \u2018smart\u2019.\nNotwithstanding, the political impact of techno-optimism is undeniable \u2013 par -\nticularly significant during \u2018the liberal decade\u2019 of the 1990s \u2013 when Francis Fukuy -\nama (1989) and other liberal thinkers projected the \u2018end of history\u2019 and the victory of liberal democracy and global capitalism. This period of liberal optimism coin -\ncided with the global spread of the Internet, which not least US administrations considered a tool for the spread of democracy and freedom around the world. The notion of \u2018internet freedom\u2019 however was and still is countered by \u2018internet sover -\neignty\u2019, the latter advocated by China, Russia and other autocratic states (cf. Ch. 2 in this volume). The liberal, and US-led \u2018Internet freedom\u2019 campaign, has also been criticised for being overly optimistic and even na\u00efve in its proponed conviction that free Internet access could pave the way for democratisation. Evgeny Morozov, for example, shows that many autocratic countries quickly adapted to the digital world and learned how to use digital surveillance and social media for control of informa -\ntion and discourse (Morozov, 2012).\nFurther, the rise of nerd power is facilitated by the immense growth of the \nprivate sector in digitalisation of the world. Researchers have estimated that in 2018 the size of the global digital economy was worth $11.5 trillion, and that the share of the digital economy of global wealth is 15.5%, but also that its share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is growing two to three times faster than GDP itself (Henry-Nickie, Frimpong, & Sun, 2019). On a general level, power in the global information society has been perceived as divided between national govern -\nments, private business and individuals (Choucri, 2012; Dunn-Cavelty & Suter, 2009; Eriksson & Giacomello, 2006; Giacomello, 2003; Hoijtink & Leese, 2019; \n\n86 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nMcCarthy, 2018). Civil society should be added to the list, as many social move -\nments and other civil society stakeholders have become preeminent in cyber, not least in the social media sphere.\nCivil society cannot match the private sector in cyberspace however; nor can \nnational governments, generally speaking. The exception that proves the rule is heavily state-controlled national cyber domains, in particular those of China. In most liberal and market-capitalist countries however, national governments have been unable and possibly unprepared to \u2018rein in\u2019 other players. Indeed, \u2018reining in\u2019 has not been the aim of most governments in liberal democracies, given strong appetites for privatisation and outsourcing. An example of this is the Swedish Transport Agency which in 2014 began a process of outsourcing several national-security databases to IBM, which in turn outsourced data further to unvetted sub-contractors, including the national driving license registry, the national vehicle registry, data on secret agents and other persons with protected identities, and data -\nbases on airport and harbour security \u2013 examples of critical information infrastruc -\nture (Newlove-Eriksson, Giacomello, & Eriksson, 2018). This outsourcing was swiftly accomplished without vetting any of the foreign private company computer nerds who were granted access to highly sensitive databases. When this unvetted outsourcing and the worries of the Swedish Security Service (indeed these circum -\nstances required their investigation into the activities of other Swedish authorities) were revealed by the Swedish newspaper DN, the political scandal was a fact, with the Director of the Swedish Transport Agency and two ministers (Anders Ygeman \u2013  \nthen Minister of the Interior; and Anna Johansson, Minister of Infrastructure) resigning in 2017. The extent of the damage done to national (and possibly even EU) security was never fully disclosed.\nThis episode reveals how nerd power can be expanded as a result of politi -\ncal decisions and incompetence, in this case by a Social Democratic government (thus it is not simply a choice preferred by neoliberal parties). It also demonstrates how the role of the traditional national security state is changing. As Adam Smith observed (Coulomb, 1998), defence has been one of the necessary expenses of government; individuals and their businesses would pay a (relatively) small amount, through taxes, but would gain advantages such as security from the com -\nmon good of defence. In other words, the latter were net beneficiaries. This state of affairs can be seen to remain basically unaltered since the end of the Cold War \u2013  \nundoubtedly, businesses and tax-payers contributed to national security, but they \ndid so indirectly . This balance appears to have changed in many Western countries, \nwhere outsourcing of public utilities and even core functions of national security began in the 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, breaches of national security and secrecy are more likely than in the more traditionally \u2018insourced\u2019 national security state. Moreover, with private actors and public-private partnerships (PPP) taking over certain national security functions, problems of accountability typically ensue \n(Giacomello, 2021; Newlove-Eriksson et al., 2018; cf. Chapters 1, 2 and 6 in this volume).\nRise of the Nerd 87\nThe rise of private authority in the domain of digitalised national security began \nwith the transfer of the original Internet from the US Department of Defense to the Department of Commerce, which, with great insight, was made publicly avail-able, for individual users and businesses to use (Hafner & Lyon, 1996). As is well known now, the \u2018net\u2019 was at first a gizmo for researchers, academics, visionaries and computer nerds. Importantly, the design power exercised by original develop -\ners of the Internet continues to determine the scope and parameters of Internet usage, particularly through the TCP/IP and Domain Name Systems for websites and the browsing histories and identification of interconnected devices. Business took notice and in 1999 the \u2018dot com\u2019 bubble burst, as the early digital economy was based on potential rather than real gains; the \u2018net\u2019 could certainly be a huge window for its products and was a boon for media.\nA decade later, digitalisation of business took off in earnest, boosted also by \nthe development of social media, which resulted in new forms of design and con -\nnecting power. Simultaneously, public utilities and critical infrastructure became progressively digitalised and outsourced to private companies or privatised with PPP for regulation. The Y2K or \u2018millennium bug\u2019, a bug in the basic clock set -\nting of computers all over the world 1999/2000, was not only detected by com -\nputer experts, but also \u2018fixed\u2019 by the same type of nerds. This global point in time spurred widespread fear, from the possibility that automated banking machines and medical life-saving medical technology would stop working, to rendering airplanes unable to fly and trains impossible to drive. The Y2K episode not only highlighted \nthe power of the computer nerd \u2013 both as culprit (for erecting the fallible computer clock system in the first place) and as an essential party to solutions \u2013 but also demonstrated the pivotal role of the private sector. The private sector owned and managed most of the systems affected, and the relevant expertise to fix the bug lay mainly within private companies. Since then, the reliance of governments on critical information infrastructure maintained and protected by private actors has rapidly increased, as well as demands for greater oversight (Giacomello, 2021; Newlove-Eriksson et al., 2018).\nAnother element of the shift towards private authority was the emergence of \ngenuine digital technology companies: Amazon was born in the mid-1990s; in the early 2000s Microsoft not only maintained its dominance in the PC software mar -\nket but also expanded into online services and gaming; Apple launched its first iPhone in 2007, which made online connectivity possible from a handheld device; \nFacebook appeared in 2010, and has since then been a dominant social media com -\npany. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and various lockdowns of 2020 dramatically boosted the digital share of the economy. The impact of digital companies on the world economy has become paramount, to the point that today, the wealthiest com -\npanies are no longer oil companies, but Big Tech, while \u2018traditional\u2019 businesses struggle to adapt.\nAs noted by Hyslop (2007, p. 5), \u2018[t]he privatization of utilities and the adoption \nof \u201cJust in Time\u201d delivery techniques for food and fuel mean there is very little \n\n88 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\n\u201cgive\u201d in the system to cater for unexpected events\u2019. Circumstances have allowed companies owning and operating cyber-physical infrastructures to become so essential to contemporary life and economies that they are almost \u2018untouchable\u2019 \u2013 certainly not damaged or hampered by current fluctuations and disturbances. Given this state of affairs, it is hardly surprising that calls to \u2018break up\u2019 such companies go unanswered and that \u2018Big Tech\u2019 is openly recognised as \u2018big bullies\u2019 (Ovide, 2020); for modern societies, these digital companies and even the smaller ones are deemed essential \u2013 interruptions in their service delivery would have a tremendous impact on social life and well-being. As a result, most digital businesses and in particular \u2018Big Tech\u2019 have an extremely powerful bargaining position when it comes to deal -\ning with users and even governments. In the physical world, arguably not even \u2018Big Oil\u2019 has ever enjoyed the influence or clout of digital capital. China, where internationally as well as domestically successful digital companies such as TikTok and Huawei are closely monitored if not controlled by the central government pro -\nvides an interesting case. With the exception of China and other autocratic states, national governments cannot easily rule cyberspace against the desiderata of digital companies (cf. Chapter 2 in this volume). Simultaneously in the West, demands on the regulation of \u2018Big Tech\u2019 and release of their \u2018Big Data\u2019 has arisen over the last decade, notably with regard to Facebook (Smyth, 2019) \u2013 it remains to be seen if Australia\u2019s recent challenge to Facebook in response to the company\u2019s criticised \u2018banning\u2019 of public information will have a resounding impact.\nHow, then, does the rise of the private digital business sector facilitate the bol -\nstering of nerd power? In sum, there are three aspects of this. First, given gen -\neral \u2018Big Tech\u2019 power vis-\u00e0-vis national governments, combined with the fact that computer nerds build and manage the technology and digital services provided by private companies, nerd power is generally increasing. Second, the trend of priva -\ntisation, outsourcing and PPP may imply heightened capacity and efficiency \u2013 note, however, that substantial empirical evidence indicates otherwise, particularly with respect to delays and heightened costs \u2013 but this in any case almost always comes with a cost in terms of loss of transparency and public accountability. In turn, this may create increased discretion for individual companies as well as for the com -\nputer nerds who actually construct and operate the digital systems. Third, computer nerds may on occasion find themselves in temporary positions where they can have a more direct impact on political agendas around the world, as in the case of \u2018hack -\ntivists\u2019 such as Julian Assange and Edward Snowden.\nFinally, we suggest that computer nerds constitute a generally more powerful \nepistemic category than that of other nerds, such as experts working on nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, to take a limited specific example, even though these specialisations may also entail computer expertise overlap. Importantly, advanced skills in computer programming are no longer a separate nerd domain proficiency but are pivotal in basically every other field of technology as well, as a \ngeneral result of digitalisation. For example, automated weapons systems, drones and military command and control systems all depend on the skill and knowledge of \n\nRise of the Nerd 89\ncomputer experts, from design to operation, maintenance and upgrade.  Moreover, individuals with profound and specialised knowledge of software programming and computer networks typically have an insider \u2018legacy\u2019 advantage that can sig -\nnificantly strengthen or weaken the knowledge reservoir, position and influence of any organisation, whether state or non-state, that highly competent nerds may decide to work or not work for. Whereas development and control of for example advanced weapons technology is highly restricted, requiring security classification, and the \u2018applicability\u2019 of automated weapon systems is comparatively limited, the wider community of computer nerds find their knowledge and skills applicable in far wider domains of society, business and politics.\nConclusion: Nerd Power in a \u2018Fragmegrated\u2019 World\nWe have made the case that nerd power is on the rise, largely due to increasing global dependency on the power of computer nerds to design, connect and ana -\nlyse computer software, networks and \u2018Big Data\u2019. While critical infrastructures and multiple public utilities, as well as private homes, workplaces and even human bodies are increasingly digitally interconnected, control and responsibility appears to be more dispersed and compartmentalised. Simultaneous technological integra -\ntion and political-organisational fragmentation is captured by the notion of \u2018frag -\nmegration\u2019, coined by the late James N. Rosenau (1997, Ch. 6). It can be argued that this \u2018fragmegration\u2019 contributes to increased discretion and power of com -\nputer nerds, as they are the experts actually orchestrating technological integration, whereas oversight, transparency and accountability are typically at a loss. This is yet more the case in circumstances of fast-paced technological development and change, where regulation typically lags behind economically driven innovation. While we have focused specifically on the power of computer nerds, the notion of digital \u2018fragmegration\u2019 may thus be seen as an overarching concept, which captures the disruptive, ordering and agential processes outlined in the introductory chapter to this volume.\nThe power of computer nerds is increasing, but nerds are not coordinated in a \nsingle global epistemic community, but rather work for hundreds of thousands of corporations, public administrations, international organisations and civil society organisations around the world. Contrary to ludicrous theories of \u2018global conspira -\ncies\u2019, which have gained traction through social media and algorithmic confirma -\ntion bias, there is no single \u2018megamind\u2019 out there (Roose, 2020). There is merit to the observation that Google and Facebook are dominant \u2018platform companies\u2019, whose computer nerd employees are more powerful than others, which might imply that power is clustered rather than dispersed. Notwithstanding, the complexity of \nglobal \u2018digital disruptions\u2019 implies that the power of individual computer nerds, even the most skilled, is generally confined to particular computer networks or \ncertain types of social media. Moreover, with the notable exception of \u2018hacktivists\u2019 \nand possibly some top echelon experts working for major \u2018Big Tech\u2019 companies, \n\n90 Giampiero Giacomello and Johan Eriksson\nmost computer nerds are not necessarily aware of their power, which might be the saving grace of these \u2018hidden orchestrators\u2019.\nMoreover, we have suggested that the type of expert power maintained by \ncomputer nerds is primarily of a system-shaping rather than relational kind. This system-shaping power consists of three subsets of nerd power: \u2018design power\u2019 that shapes the digital platforms and applications used by individuals and organisa -\ntions; \u2018connecting power\u2019 that shapes the networks which allow real-time commu -\nnication and digitalisation of infrastructure; and \u2018analytical power\u2019 which controls and produces knowledge of the digital world, including the increasing use of \u2018Big Data\u2019. The system-shaping nature of nerd power is a form of \u2018structural power\u2019, as conceptualised in the IR power literature (Baldwin, 2016, p. 81, Barnett & Duvall, 2005, pp. 52\u201355). Nerd power is not, however, confined to the realm of \u2018structural power\u2019, but also has \u2018productive\u2019 capacity (Barnett & Duvall, 2005, p. 55), specifi -\ncally with regard to the analytical power of computer experts.\nWe have suggested that the rise of nerd power is a result of a combination of \nthree key drivers. First, design power is growing because of the speedy increase in dependency on digital software applications and algorithms  which not only indi -\nviduals but also major public services and infrastructures rely on. Second, con -\nnecting power is growing because states and non-state actors are involved in a process of digital interconnectedness  of critical infrastructure and public services, \nwhich previously were analogue and operated independently from one other (cf. Ch. 6 in this volume). Third, analytical nerd power is increasing in significance \nbecause of the quantitative growth of information , through advances in \u2018Big Data\u2019 \nand quantum computing, that is, what Bjola and Kornprobst in the introduction to this volume identify as one of the main sources of \u2018digital disruption\u2019. It remains to be seen whether continued technological development of, for example, machine-learning AI and 6G communications \u2013 the latter predicted to be characterised not only by greater data volumes and speed but by transforming user experiences \u2013 will alter the shape and significance of nerd power.\nThere is promise for further research on nerd power in applying and devel -\noping the three subtypes of power and in seeking to reveal patterns of similarity and difference across techno-organisational domains where boundary distinction is evident. For example, does nerd power play out differently within major \u2018platform companies\u2019 in comparison with for example small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), public administration, and the military? How is nerd power conditioned \nby political and economic circumstances, that is, how does it vary across democra -\ncies and autocracies, as well as across richer \u2018information economies\u2019 as opposed to less prosperous countries? How does legislation and regulation attempt to keep pace with technological developments, as is observed for example in the area of Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) norm-building? Systematic empir -\nical inquiry is needed in computing-heavy fields, particularly approaches which \npromise to penetrate the black box of tech communities and organisations, to get as close as possible to the real world of computer nerds and their \u2018communities of \n\nRise of the Nerd 91\npractice\u2019 (Wenger, 1998). Further insight into the significant gendered dimension where males dominate computing professions \u2013 particularly at higher levels \u2013 is also needed in order to understand and explain nerd power and its implications for international relations.\nNotes\n 1 See also Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires , a 1996 three-part TV doc -\numentary by Robert X.

Faced with a pandemic that \nabruptly halted most non-essential air travel, diplomats, civil servants and even \nleaders resorted to replacing physical face-to-face interactions with mediated \ncommunications in digital environments. Video conferencing through platforms \nsuch as Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Skype quickly became routine and habitual, \nwith some notable successes. A  virtual summit held by G20 energy ministers in \nApril  2020 led to an agreement to cut crude oil production in order to stabilise the \neffects of the pandemic on oil markets. The G7, International Monetary Fund and \nWorld Bank all successfully convened video conferences in the early days of the \npandemic ( Naylor, 2020 ). Almost as quickly, however, lamentations that interac -\ntion through digital means could not replicate the face-to-face experience followed. \nWhile criticisms of digital interaction varied, the basic claim is simply that digitally \nmediated interaction, as Ashok Mirpuri, Singapore\u2019s veteran ambassador in Wash -\nington, put it, is \u2018not real diplomacy\u2019 (quoted in Heath, 2020 ). There can simply be \nno substitute for being in the room together. Whether because of an inability to read \nimportant social cues and signals transmitted in and through face-to-face interac -\ntion, or the lost opportunity to broaden one\u2019s set of contacts and social networks \nthrough informal in-person meetings, the argument is clear: digital interaction sim -\nply cannot compare to its physical counterpart and relationships, networks, and \ntrust-producing social bonds suffer as a result.\nIntriguingly, however, existing research suggests that diplomats, ambassadors \nand heads of state have long been able to create bonds with one another and develop 4\nCAN YOU TRUST IN ZOOM? BONDS \nAND TRUST IN DIGITAL SPACES\nMarcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\n\n100  Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nsophisticated social networks, through non-face-to-face modalities of interaction. \nWhether the use of letters in Italian Renaissance diplomacy ( Lazzarini, 2012 ) or \ndiplomatic cables and letters in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries ( J\u00f6nsson  & \nHall, 2005 ), prior to safe and regular air travel, leaders and diplomats often had \nno choice but to build bonds and trust through the written word. As scholars of \nearly modern Europe have pointed out, there is a very long history of individuals \nbuilding social networks and trust through mediated communication of this kind \nbecause that was the only possible way to accomplish it. Consider a merchant in \neighteenth-century Europe who had to rely on the trustworthiness of agents whom \nhe or she had never met and the temptation to cheat omnipresent ( Hudson, 2014 ). \nIn other work, we (Wheeler  & Holmes, 2021) have demonstrated that a bond can \ndevelop through text between the leaders of two nuclear adversary states, exempli -\nfied by the relationship of trust that formed through the exchange of letters between \nJohn F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a bond \nthat ultimately contributed to that event ending peacefully rather than in disaster. \nMore recently, some scholars have pointed out how the use of mobile phones, par -\nticularly their text messaging capabilities, can similarly sustain, or perhaps even \nbuild, bonds in much the same way that letters did in earlier periods ( Ling, 2008a , \n2008b ). This creates something of a puzzle. Diplomats and leaders bemoan the \nlimits to trust in digitally mediated interactions, such as video conferencing, while \nthey historically have been able to build trust and networks with far less. This \nis particularly puzzling since new digital technologies provide the opportunity to \nmimic, at least to a large degree, the visual face-to-face experience.\nIn this chapter we explore this puzzle by interrogating how bonds are created \nin diplomacy. Drawing upon recent work in microsociology, we elaborate on the \nconditions under which social bonds can be expected to form between individu -\nals, including diplomats and leaders. We then assess the extent to which these \nconditions are present in face-to-face interactions, telephonic, text-based commu -\nnication, and finally video-conferencing technology. We argue that diplomats and \nleaders are not wrong to point out the limitations of video conferencing technolo -\ngies, but they have not articulated the fundamental nature of the problem, which \nincludes a lack of the information richness that exists in and through face-to-face \ninteraction, the preclusion of serendipitous encounters, and crucially, a reduced \nability to exclude outsiders. Moreover, we demonstrate that while physical interac -\ntions are required for strong bond formation, these other communication modali -\nties at the disposal of leaders and diplomats may offer opportunities for bonding, \nalbeit of a weaker type. While in the modern period leaders and diplomats are \naccustomed to the opportunity and potential to bond in person, we argue that co-\npresent interaction is not a necessary condition for weaker bond formation. These \nbonds, in turn, open up possibilities for agential processes of enticing and winning \nover, as discussed in the Introductory chapter of this volume. We conclude with \nreflections on how social bonds between dyads of diplomats may be created and \nextended in cyberspace.\n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  101\nInteraction Ritual Chains: Building Bonds\nHow social networks initially emerge and subsequently grow, particularly those \ncharacterised by strong social ties, such as interpersonal bonds, remains one of the \ncentral questions in the field of microsociology. Put simply, how and why do indi -\nviduals hit it off with others in some cases, but not others, and how do these bonds \nproliferate to form large networks? Microsociology, the study of individuals and \ntheir interaction, is premised on the notion that large macro-level phenomena, such \nas a social movement or even society itself, are rooted in the aggregation of micro-\nlevel events. Microsociologists are therefore interested in the ways in which inter -\nactions between individuals, or groups, and \u2018chains\u2019 of those interactions, combine \nto create structures. Randall Collins (2004 , p. 276), a leading theorist in the field, \nputs it in the following way: we can view the social world as \u2018a bundle of individual \nchains of interactional experience, criss-crossing each other in space as they flow \nalong in time\u2019. The interactional experiences that individuals have are referred to as \ninteraction rituals, and they vary considerably in just how \u2018micro\u2019 they are: from two \nindividuals gossiping at the water cooler at the office, to thousands of individuals \nsimultaneously expressing nationalistic solidarity by singing the national anthem \nat a sporting event. Collins (2004 , p. 39) theorises that we engage in such interac -\ntions in order to gain positive \u2018emotional energy (EE)\u2019, or a \u2018socially derived .  . .  \nfeeling of confidence, courage to take action, [and] boldness in taking initiative\u2019. \nConsequently, interactions that produce EE are experienced as more positive, \nuplifting and ultimately desirable. Some interaction rituals, on the other hand, are \nnot as successful in producing EE and, as a consequence, the interaction falls flat.\nTo explain this, Collins identifies four interaction ritual ingredients that are \nrequired for positive EE to be generated: bodily co-presence, mutual focus of atten -\ntion, shared mood and a barrier to outsiders. Bodily co-presence is defined by Col-\nlins (2004 , p. 48) as \u2018two or more people physically assembled in the same place, so \nthat they affect each other by their bodily presence, whether it is in the foreground \nof their conscious attention or not\u2019. Co-presence is necessary because it provides \nindividuals the ability to \u2018monitor each other\u2019s signals and bodily expressions\u2019, \nfacilitating \u2018that human nervous systems become mutually attuned\u2019 ( 2004 , p. 64). \nMutual focus of attention refers to \u2018a common object or activity\u2019 where individuals \n\u2018become mutually aware of each other\u2019s focus of attention\u2019 ( Collins, 2004 , p. 48). \nSinging the national anthem in the stadium before a sporting event, participating in \na religious event where the congregation is focused on a particular prayer, or even \nhaving a conversation about a film with a co-worker at cafe, for example, all are \nexamples of individuals both turning their attention to a common focus and, cru -\ncially, being aware of that common focus in others. Additionally, individuals must \nalso \u2018share common mood or emotional experience\u2019 ( Collins, 2004 , p. 48). Col -\nlins notes the importance of affective matching: a disjuncture between emotional \nstates, such as apathy by one and excitement by the other, results in a mismatch \nthat is inauspicious with respect to the prospects of bonding. When individuals \n\n102  Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nare effectively matched in mood or emotion, there is a possibility of getting \u2018into \nshared rhythm, caught up in each other\u2019s motions and emotions\u2019 ( Collins, 2004 , \np. 64). Shared mood and mutual focus of attention may also reinforce one another. \nThe physical co-presence of individuals aids this by allowing individuals in the \ninteraction \u2018to signal and confirm a common focus of attention and thus a state of \nintersubjectivity\u2019 ( Collins, 2004 , p. 64).\nThe theorised causal mechanism by which the four ingredients produce bond -\ning is collective effervescence. Originally theorised by \u00c9mile Durkheim, collec -\ntive effervescence is \u2018intensification of shared experience\u2019 ( Collins, 2004 , p. 35) \nor simultaneity of thought or action. For Collins, it is this shared experience of the \ninteraction, including the shared intensity of experience, shared affective arousal \nand mutual entrainment that results in positive EE and a social bond. Crucially, \nhowever, not all interactions will produce bonds. Many, perhaps most, interactions \nfall flat. As Collins (2004 , p. 51) argues, when interactions fail, the ingredients to \nsuccess are not present, and the result is a negative corollary of positive EE: \u2018a \nsense of a drag, the feeling of boredom and constraint, even depression, interaction \nfatigue, a desire to escape\u2019. Put simply, \u2018[s]uccessful rituals are exhilarating; failed \nrituals are energy draining\u2019 (Collins, 2004, p.  53). Finally , while Collins has not \nfully elaborated on the concept, Boyns and Luery (2015 ) highlight the potential \nfor negative EE. Their intervention is to point out that not all of these emergent \neffects are normatively positive. Indeed, there is a \u2018dark-side\u2019 of emotional energy \nthat can be found in anger, rage, resentment and distrust. In a social media con -\ntext, for example, QAnon followers in the United States may develop bonds with \none another where the collective effervescence is rooted in anger. Collins (2021 ) \nreflecting on the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January  2021, remarked on the \nritual destruction behaviour, that which \u2018is seemingly purposeless, to outsiders and \nopponents. But it is meaningful, or at least deeply impulsive for those who do it: a \ncollective, social emotion for those involved\u2019.\nSeveral aspects of this model, as they affect applicability to digital networks, are \nworth noting. The first is perhaps evident, but worth emphasis: interaction elements \nare privileged over dispositional or situational/environmental characteristics. One \nmight imagine, for example, that a successful bond between two individuals, say \nworld leaders, would develop because of their personal dispositions, such as per -\nsonality, or perhaps shared historical experience. On this reading, Mikhail Gor -\nbachev and Ronald Reagan developed a relationship in the 1980s through summitry \nbecause their personalities were amenable to bonding and both possessed a shared \ndisposition that a nuclear war must never be fought. One might also argue that the \ninternational environment facilitated such interaction in the first place. Similarly, \nif one was interested in explaining why Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin\u2019s rela -\ntionship did not replicate the success of Reagan and Gorbachev, one could argue \nthat the addition of the two personalities clashed, or that the international envi -\nronment was not conducive to interpersonal bond formation among leaders. The \nCollins approach challenges us to focus less on attributes that are reducible to the \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  103\nindividuals involved in an interaction and take more seriously that which occurs \nbetween  individuals in an interaction. This is not to say, however, that dispositions, \ntraits or environmental factors are irrelevant. Far from it. Each might be critical in \ncreating conditions under which an interaction takes place, may serve as an input \nto an interaction, or may affect how likely it is for each of the ritual ingredients to \nbe present. For example, some individuals might find sharing emotion or holding \nmutual focus of attention easier than others, ultimately affecting the likelihood that \na social bond will form in the interaction. Additionally, gender and race elements \nare clearly part of the interaction and cannot easily be separated from the interac -\ntion itself. Finally, the notion of interaction ritual chains implies that history, spe -\ncifically the history of previous interactions, matters as well. As Collins puts it, \u2018the \nhistory of their chains \u2013 what sociologists have conventionally referred to as their \npositions in the social structure \u2013 is carried along in emotions and emotion-laden \ncognitions that become the ingredients for the upcoming encounter\u2019 (2004, p.  105). \nReagan and Gorbachev were able to develop new social bonds through their sum -\nmitry in the second half of the 1980s, and it was through their summits that began \nin Geneva in 1985 and ended in Moscow in 1988 that the two leaders developed \nbonds that were built upon and reinforced as Reagan and Gorbachev entered each \ninteraction with the results of their preceding successful ones.\nSecond, Collins\u2019 interaction ritual model is one that is extremely broad in scope. \nIt attempts to account for the emergence of social order by focusing on the itera -\ntive and repeated interactions at the micro-level. It should, in principle, be able to \nanalyse any dyadic, triadic or group social interaction, as well as the networks of \nritual chains that follow. This means that what each of the four ingredients means \nwill be interaction dependent. Consider shared mood and mutual focus of atten -\ntion. In previous work (Holmes  & Wheeler , 2020; Colins, 2021 ) we have applied \nthe Collins model to reassurance diplomacy, arguing that the shared exercise of \nsecurity dilemma sensibility \u2013\nan actor\u2019s intention and capacity to perceive the motives behind, and to show \nresponsiveness towards, the potential complexity of the military intentions \nof others [and] understand the role that fear might play in their attitudes and \nbehaviour, including, crucially, the role that one\u2019s actions may play in provok -\ning that fear\n(Booth  & Wheeler, 2008 , p. 7)\n\u2013 creates a mutual focus of attention, whilst positive identification of interests and \nhumanisation are necessary for the presence of shared mood. In a context outside \nof reassurance, the components of shared mood and mutual focus of attention will \nbe very different. Consider diplomats negotiating over a trade deal or a commu -\nnique regarding a pandemic. In these contexts, mutual focus might consist of spe -\ncific quantitative data on trade flows while shared mood is anxiety and fear over a \ncatastrophic level of infections.\n\n104  Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nThird, barriers to outsiders implies that individuals in an interaction are able \nto delineate those within the interaction from those outside it. For Collins, this is \ncrucial because it is what allows individuals to feel that they are part of a shared \npurpose and intentional endeavour. That is, while creating barriers may produce \nother desirable effects, such as reduced need for grandstanding or a belief about \nconfidentiality, from an interaction ritual perspective it helps to generate collec -\ntive effervescence because individuals feel group membership and belonging. The \nability  to exclude, in itself, is often important and can generate closeness and inti -\nmacy with others. Excluding outsiders has long been a feature of religious and club \nrituals, for example (see Wellman et  al., 2014 ). Importantly, barriers may exist in \nboth material/physical and ideational/symbolic senses. First, with respect to the \nphysical realm, policymakers such as diplomats or leaders are often accompanied \nby translators, note-takers, advisors, photographers, and so on. While each of these \nindividuals tend to occupy the same physical space, protagonists in an interaction \nare often able to exclude them from the interaction itself. Sometimes this exclusion \nis subtle, such as a whispered conversation in the back of the room. Other times, it \nis more overt, such as the 30 minutes North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and former \nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in spent alone sitting on a park bench in Pan -\nmunjeom, North Korea at the May  2018 Inter-Korean Summit. In either case, the \nability to exclude in the material sense involves a physical separation and barrier \nbetween who is within the interaction and who is outside of it. Barriers can also be \ncreated through non-material means as well. Discursively individuals can utilise \nlinguistic stratagems whose true meaning might only be ascertained by individuals \nwithin a particular interaction. Overt examples might involve a cryptolect, argot \nor anti-language, where a dyad or group utilises either new language or existing \nlanguage in new ways, to exclude outsiders from grasping meaning. More subtle \nexamples include reference to ideas or concepts that only those in an interaction \ncould understand. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, for example, John F. Kennedy \nand Khrushchev often referenced their singular shared responsibility as leaders \nensuring the continued existence of the planet by avoiding nuclear war (Wheeler  & \nHolmes, 2021). This \u2018cultural membership capital\u2019 ( Collins  & Hanneman, 1998 ), \nor knowledge of group symbols, represents a form of barrier creation, as outsiders \nwill be unfamiliar with the symbols that have developed over time in the group.\nFinally, and crucially, not all bonds are created equally. In previous work \n(Wheeler  & Holmes, 2021), we developed a conceptual continuum of weak and \nstrong bonds, explaining the variation in terms of the presence/absence of the \ningredients of barriers to outsiders and especially co-presence. Strong bonds are \nproducts of interaction rituals where all four elements identified by Collins are \npresent, whereas weaker bonds are products of interaction rituals where bodily \nco-presence is absent and barriers to outsiders challenged, but mutual focus of \nattention and shared mood are present. Using the case of the interpersonal bonding \nbetween Kennedy and Khrushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, we show how, \ndespite very inauspicious beginnings with respect to their interactions at the Vienna \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  105\nsummit in June  1961 (their only face-to-face encounter as heads of state), the weak \nbond that developed between them through the letters they wrote to each other \nproduced a limited form of trust and solidarity. This is contrasted with the strong \nbond of trust that developed between Reagan and Gorbachev in the second half of \nthe 1980s, arguing that this stronger form of trust became possible because of the \nface-to-face meetings that took place between the two leaders and the barriers to \noutsiders these encounters made possible. Trust is differentiated here in terms of \nthe degree of hedging and risks between two individuals. Strong bonds produce a \nform of trust where neither feels the need to hedge against the intent and integrity \nof the other in relation to a particular issue-area \u2013 this has been called trust as sus -\npension ( M\u00f6llering, 2001 , 2006 ; see also Wheeler, 2018 ). By contrast, weak bonds \ngive rise to a more limited form of trust that is characterised by the two individuals \ncontinuing to factor the risks of defection on the part of the other into their calcula -\ntions and planning.\nThe claim that the presence/absence of the ingredients of bodily co-presence and \nbarriers to outsiders influences the strength of the bond, and hence the depth of trust \npossible in social interaction, opens up the possibility, as with letters and mobile \nphone messaging, that similarly weak bonds can form in cyberspace through video \nconferencing, for example. But it also invites exploration of the intriguing pos -\nsibility that unlike letters and mobile phones, digitally mediated interaction may \nsubstitute for co-presence in ways that make possible stronger bond formation in \ncyberspace than in other modalities of non-F2F interaction.\nThe Challenge of Extending Bonds in Cyberspace\nThis difficulty in creating successful interaction chains online is seemingly why \ndiplomats have often lamented that virtual interaction is a poor substitute for face-\nto-face interaction. Several specific complaints about the online environment have \nbeen articulated. First, diplomats note the difficulty in picking up on important \nsocial signals that are, at best, degraded in online representations relative to the \nphysical experience. If \u2018winning over\u2019 (see Introductory chapter) relies on being \nable to read your interlocutor, it is not surprising that mediated communication, \neven highly sophisticated digital communication, would be viewed as inferior to \nphysical interaction. Second, online environments have difficulty replacing \u2018cor -\nridor diplomacy\u2019, or the spontaneous and impromptu interactions that can be \ncrucial for gaining consensus, building trust or winning an argument. Relatedly, \nbecause these interactions are not taking place, diplomatic network extension to \nnew contacts is hindered. Third, the requirement of barriers to outsiders is simi -\nlarly challenged. According to Ashok Mirpuri, \u2018The reason you send diplomats out \nto foreign capitals is to engage personally and share confidences and confidential \nassessments\u2019 (quoted in Heath, 2020 ). While video-conferencing technology often \nadopts stringent security protocols, individuals engaged in online meetings can \nnever be certain that others are not listening in, either in the present or potentially \n\n106  Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nin the future. The potential here for digital disruption, disruption from an outsider, \nis potentially quite high. While many of these concerns rose in prominence dur -\ning the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced face-to-face diplomacy to be replaced \nwith virtual interaction, theorising the limitations of video conferencing as a proxy \nfor physical face-to-face interaction has been noted since the relatively early days \nof the technology. We review each of these limitations, and their implications for \nsocial bonding, in turn.\nCues and Nuances\nMirpuri notes that virtual diplomacy lacks the \u2018cues and nuances\u2019 available in face-\nto-face interaction. What are these cues and why are they available in face-to-face \ninteraction but not its virtual counterpart? Over the last several decades a wealth \nof evidence from diverse fields such as psychology, sociology, biology and cogni -\ntive science have demonstrated the importance of human non-verbal expressive \nbehaviours as signaling mechanisms . Some of these behaviours, such as facial \nexpressions, are overt signals that are picked up on consciously. Others, however, \nare much more subtle and are processed subconsciously. As Alex Pentland (2008 , \np. x) puts it, \u2018These ancient primate signaling mechanisms, such as the amount of \nsynchrony, mimicry, activity, and emphasis, form an unconscious  channel of com -\nmunication between people\u2019. The signals, for Pentland, are \u2018honest\u2019 because that \nare processed unconsciously and are uncontrollable. Robert Jervis (1970 ), writing \nnearly 40  years earlier, and building on the pioneering work of Erving Goffman \n(1959 ) identified the importance of those signals that are \u2018not under the control \nof the sender\u2019, as indices , or \u2018inherently credible\u2019 indicators. Uncontrollable, non-\nverbal, subconscious behaviours therefore likely serve as indices for individuals \nengaged in a face-to-face interaction that offer \u2018an unmatched window into our \nintentions, goals, and values\u2019 ( Pentland, 2008 ; see also Holmes, 2013 , 2018 ; Yarhi-\nMilo, 2014 ).\nWhile overt facial expressions of emotion (anger, fear, and so forth) are often \ncontrollable, at least to a large extent (some are better than others at controlling \nfacial expressions), microfacial expressions of emotion (hereafter microexpres -\nsions) are involuntary ( Ekman, 1985 , 2009 ). Microexpressions are \u2018spontane -\nously occurring, non-concealed, non-repressed facial expressions of emotions\u2019 \n(Matsumoto  & Hwang, 2018 ; see also Matsumoto  & Hwang, 2017). Unlike nor -\nmally occurring emotional facial expressions, which may last for a few seconds \n(or longer), the duration of microexpressions is much shorter, typically under \nhalf of a second ( Matsumoto  & Hwang, 2018 ). Consequently, they are very dif -\nficult to identify consciously and reflectively, but rather are processed subcon -\nsciously and automatically. Or, using the dual process metaphor of \u2018system 1\u2019 \nand \u2018system 2\u2019 made popular by Daniel Kahneman, but proposed originally by \nStanovich and West (2000 ), microexpressions are processed in system 1. Given \ntheir automatic processing nature, and uncontrollable origin, microexpressions \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  107\nhave been hypothesised as one of the honest signals, or indices, that Pent -\nland argues is so crucial for social interaction. They allow us to understand, \nin an automatic and subconscious way, what another person is experiencing \nemotionally in an interaction, providing critical information, or \u2018cues\u2019, as to \ntheir current disposition and mental state. Perhaps even more important from a \ndiplomacy perspective, there is some evidence that microexpressions are a vital \ncue for distinguishing \u2018truths from lies about future malicious intent\u2019 ( Matsu -\nmoto  & Hwang, 2018 ). While detecting deception is obviously not a foolproof \nproposition, it does seem to be the case that face-to-face interactions provide \nevidence regarding deception that would be unavailable in other interaction \nmodalities ( Holmes, 2018 ).1 Finally, as many psychologists argue that facial \nexpressions, and their micro counterparts, \u2018are universally produced and rec -\nognized\u2019 ( Hwang  & Matsumoto, 2016 ), interaction in cross-cultural and cross-\nethnic settings should produce similar abilities to pick up on these subtle cues \nand nuances.\nOther forms of nonverbal expressions are also relevant. Kinaesthetics, some -\ntimes referred to as body language, or the communication that occurs through \n\u2018body posture, mannerisms, gestures, and the prosody of .  . . movement\u2019, similarly \nplays an important role in social interaction as microexpressions by \u2018providing \nimportant clues about the intentions, emotions, and motivations of others\u2019 ( Tipper, \nSignorini,  & Grafton, 2015 ). Proxemics, or the use of spatial proximity to con -\nvey information, similarly provides insights into how individuals feel about one \nanother, delineating social space from personal space and intimate space (see, for \nexample, Sundstrom  & Altman, 1976 ). While microexpressions focus on the face, \nbody language studies bring in the rest of the human body to the analysis, replacing \nthe misnomer face-to-face interaction with \u2018body-to-body\u2019 interaction ( Fortunati, \n2005 ). One of the extraordinary findings in this literature is what some researchers \nhave referred to as the \u2018chameleon effect\u2019, or the subconscious mimicry of body \nlanguage, including proxemics, mannerisms and so forth ( Chartrand  & Bargh, \n1999 ). The visual perception of another\u2019s physical behaviour often induces the \nengagement of that same physical behaviour.2 The relevance of this effect for inter -\naction is that there are social consequences of the mimicry: \u2018mimicking someone \ncauses the mimickee to have more positive feelings about the mimicker\u2019 ( Casas -\nanto, Casasanto, Gijssels,  & Peter, 2020 ). One explanation for this finding is that \nthe mimicker\u2019s actions communicate something along the lines of \u2018I am with you\u2019 \nor \u2018I am like you\u2019 (see Bavelas, Black, Chovil, Lemery,  & Mullett, 1988 ), while \nanother is that mimicry signals \u2018the mimicker\u2019s readiness to perform cooperative \nactions\u2019 ( Casasanto et  al., 2020 ).\nThe effects of mimicry on trust can be stark. In Pentland\u2019s studies of mimicry \nas a honest signal, he finds in physical body-to-body interaction that not only did \nthe amount of mimicry predict variation in the negotiation outcome, but crucially \nthat \u2018negotiations with a lot of mimicry left both the boss and the new employee \nwith a strong feeling that everyone had cooperated to avoid getting stuck in sharp \n\n108  Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\ndisagreement\u2019, suggesting that mimicry is an honest \u2018signal of the trust as well as \nthe empathy required for successful negotiations\u2019 ( Pentland, 2008 , p. 12).\nThe difficulty with moving diplomatic interactions online is degradation of the \nfacial cues and often absence of many of the body cues. As mentioned earlier, \nmicroexpressions are subtle and quick. In order to be read they need to be visible. \nDepending on the video setup, this may be difficult. Lighting, distance from the \ncamera and a number of other variables can easily affect one\u2019s ability to pick up \non overt, let alone subtle and unconscious facial behaviours. Publicly available \nphotographs of the G7 meeting in March  2020 demonstrate this nicely, as some \nleaders are seated quite far from the camera, where the face represents a very small \npercentage of the frame, in poor lighting, while others are closer to the camera in \nbetter lighting.\nFurther, while video conferencing technology has improved significantly since \nits mainstream adoption beginning in the late 1980s, media richness theory sug -\ngests that it falls short of physical face-to-face and body-to-body interaction in its \nability to reproduce the information produced in physically co-present environ -\nments ( Kydd  & Ferry, 1994 ). Even the most sophisticated digital representation \nalgorithms on the fastest connections must confront several challenges not present \nin physical interaction, including latency (i.e. the delay between information being \nsent and received), jitter (i.e. variation in the time that information is received, \ntypically caused by non-local network congestion), information loss (i.e. data not \nIMAGE 4.1  G7 Meeting, March  2020\nSource:  \u9996\u76f8\u5b98\u90b8\u30db\u30fc\u30e0\u30da\u30fc\u30b8\n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  109\nreaching its intended destination) and frame rate (i.e. the rate at which the video \nsetup can produce unique images). For example, consider the potential effects of \nvideo packet loss or reduced frame rate when it comes to viewing a split-second \nmicroexpression. Or consider a very slight delay between audio and video rep -\nresentation, where in a physical co-present interaction a viewer would be able to \nmatch microexpression with a word being said, but in the digital environment the \nmatch is no longer perfect, introducing ambiguity into the intended meaning of the \nsender. These types of problems may be exacerbated by less powerful technologi -\ncal equipment and distance from centralised servers, a problem that may be par -\nticularly acute for less wealthy countries, which we address further later. Similarly, \nbecause many video-conferencing settings may be set to capture \u2018head-to-head\u2019 \nrather than \u2018body-to-body\u2019, an important source of information for cooperation, \nexpressive behaviours, and the mimicry that often follows from those behaviours, \nis lost. The aforementioned G7 photographs illustrate this well, as all heads of state \nare seated with only their upper bodies available for view. Mimicry in these condi -\ntions will be challenging at best.\nAnother ramification of physical cues being difficult to read is that individuals \nwill attempt to make up for this deficit by paying acute attention to parsing other \navailable indicators, such as auditory speech acts. As Andrew Franklin argues, \nresearch in cyberpsychology points at the problem: \u2018For somebody who\u2019s really \ndependent on those non-verbal cues, it can be a big drain not to have them\u2019, result -\ning in a phenomenon some have referred to as \u2018Zoom fatigue\u2019, or the taxing nature \nof video-mediated interactions due to the brain making up for physical cues that \nare normally available by searching elsewhere for them (quoted in Sklar, 2020 ; see \nalso Bailenson, 2021 ). As the number of individuals on a given screen prolifer -\nates, as in the G7 case, the fatigue problem is magnified. Video-mediated-induced \nfatigue likely has several effects, including elevated cognitive effort. Or as Jena \nLee puts it, \u2018Simply put, videoconferences can be associated with low reward and \nhigh cost\u2019 ( 2020 ). Bramsen and Hagemann (2021 ) note this phenomenon of virtual \ninteractions feeling \u2018physically very draining\u2019, and outline the deleterious effects \nsuch fatigue has on peace diplomacy, most notably shorter meetings that dissipate \nany positive emotional energy that has developed through the encounter. On the \nflipside, shorter meetings may be welcome if they reduce any negative emotional \nenergy that has developed between the participants.\nFrom a proxemics or spatial relationship perspective, video technologies chal -\nlenge the ability to create interpersonal or intimate space between leaders. Prox -\nemic interactions often are delineated into at least four discrete distance zones, \nwith \u2018public space\u2019 interactions composing those interactions that take place with \nindividuals 12 or more feet apart, \u2018social space\u2019 interactions composing 4\u201312 feet \nof separation, \u2018personal space\u2019 or interpersonal space as 1.5\u20134 feet, and \u2018intimate \nspace\u2019 as less than an inch up to 18 inches ( Hall, 1963 ). Interpersonal interactions, \nsuch as the ones one might expect in diplomatic interactions, typically occur in the \npersonal space zone of 1.5\u20134 feet separation. Individuals will utilise changes  in \n\n110 Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\npersonal or intimate space to convey sincerity, concern, or other to convey emo -\ntion. The challenges for digital videoconferencing are threefold. First, many tech -\nnology setups cannot sufficiently reduce space between individuals to less than 4 \nfeet. The reason is that individual perceptions of space, in mediated environments, \noften differ from the objective \u2018distance\u2019 between two individuals and their cam -\neras ( Wainfan  & Davis, 2004 ). Second, video conferencing setups are also not \noften conducive for reducing distance between individuals, as leaders, in particular, \noften wish to interact at a distance from their camera. Finally, unless individuals \nphysically vary their distance from the camera, affecting change in the separation \nbetween individuals, it is difficult to move from social space to (inter)personal \nspace, which likely has effects in the ability to interact more intimately and form \nstrong bonds.\nTurning to the challenge of building trust virtually in conflict environments \nwhere there is little or no trust, Bramsen and Hagemann argue, based on interviews \nwith participants in women mediator networks in the Yemeni and Syrian conflicts, \nthat the absence of body-to-body interaction can negatively impact the possibility \nof developing trust. According to one person they interviewed, speaking in the \ncontext of how co-present interaction makes it easier to ameliorate any tensions \nthat have arisen in the course of a formal meeting, \u2018we deal with that at the end \nof the meeting, we pat each other\u2019s shoulders and we go and have coffee together \nand we smile\u2019 (quoted in Bramsen  & Hagemann, 2021 , p. 13). Another interviewee \nreflected on the limits of virtual trust-building compared to co-present interaction. \nWhat was missing from her virtual interactions was\nthe physical contact, the eye contact, the informal discussions around lunch, \ndinner, corridor, and so on that make a difference in those meetings, but when \nit is virtual it is only their voice and our voice and I  find these meetings quite \ndisappointing .  . . the trust building doesn\u2019t happen virtually.\n(quoted in Bramsen  & Hagemann, 2021 , p. 18)\nIt is these body-to-body interactions, what Bramsen and Hagemann called negotiat -\ning \u2018not just with your face but with your whole body\u2019 ( 2021 , p. 13) that make pos -\nsible the humanisation of one\u2019s enemy \u2013 the shared mood ingredient in our theory \nof diplomatic social bonding. One important finding of Bramsen and Hagemann\u2019s \nresearch, confirming Ling\u2019s (2008a ) earlier finding, is that where some trust had \nbeen developed through earlier co-present interactions, this could be maintained \nthrough virtual interactions. However, where the trust had not developed before, it \nwas \u2018impossible\u2019, according to Bramsen and Hagemann, \u2018to build through online \ncontact only\u2019 ( 2021 , p. 18). This is an important finding that will need to be tested \nin other empirical cases, but if accurate, it has disconcerting conclusions for leader-\nto-leader interactions in the context of quick-breaking crises, perhaps involving \nnuclear-armed adversaries, where the only modality available of interpersonal \ninteraction is digital.\n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  111\nYet, such a negative finding on the possibility of developing trust virtually con -\ntrasts with our argument that Kennedy and Khrushchev were able to develop a weak \nbond and a corresponding form of trust through textually mediated interaction dur -\ning the Cuban Missile Crisis. What makes this finding so important is that the US \nand Soviet leaders entered the crisis in a relationship of deep distrust; their first, \nand only face-to-face encounter as heads of state, being their disastrous encounter \nat Vienna in June  1961. Could textually mediated bonding of the kind achieved by \nKennedy and Khrushchev in October  1962 be replicated digitally in a crisis involv -\ning potentially more than two nuclear-armed states, such as the triangular dynamics \nbetween India, China and Pakistan in South Asia, where leaders were operating \nwith fear and suspicion of their adversaries? Or, does effective crisis management \nin the multipolar nuclear world of the twenty-first century require a minimum foun -\ndation of interpersonal trust, or at the very least the absence of distrust, before \ndigitally mediated interaction can be relied upon to de-escalate a crisis? As Shah \nand Walker point out in the context of the crisis management potential of existing \nnuclear hotlines, \u2018trust is the issue: trust in the identity of the interlocutor; trust in \nthe system itself, including its robustness under the most extreme conditions; and \ntrust in the messages it carries\u2019 ( Shah  & Walker, 2021 ). Leaders interacting virtu -\nally may overcome the problem of identifying the interlocutor (though so-called \n\u2018deep fakes\u2019 may still pose concerns), but there is the concern \u2013 as with hotlines \u2013 \nthat leaders might find it easier to deceive their opponents in environments that lack \nthe information richness of face-to-face interaction. As Holmes (2018 ) has argued, \nthe brain\u2019s deception detection capacities \u2013 though not foolproof \u2013 are at its most \nadvanced in physically co-present interaction, largely due to the presence of cues \nand nuances that are challenged in digital contexts.\nIt is conceivable, or perhaps even probable, that continued technological devel -\nopment will ameliorate some of the issues we have discussed in this section. Vir -\ntual reality, artificial intelligence and augmented reality technology (see Bjola, \n2019 ), for example, may soon allow diplomats and leaders to engage in more \nembodied interaction, where tele-presence allows individuals to feel as if they \nare physically present in the same room with one. Theoretically, these technolo -\ngies should make it easier for individuals to share common affect, or, crucially, \nto share mood. Ministries of foreign affairs have been experimenting with virtual \nembassies for some time and some governments ( Sotiriu, 2015 ), such as the US, \nhave formed working groups and workshops investigating the potential for new \nways to interact virtually beyond the computer screen ( Herman, 2016 ). It must \nremain an open question given the speed of technological change in the digital \nworld whether future technologies will close the bonding and trust gap in con -\nflict situations between body-to-body interaction and attempts to substitute for \nit using digitally mediated interaction. What can be said with greater certainty \nis that individuals, whether grassroots peacemakers or political leaders, continue \nto value meeting their adversaries in a co-present space above all other modes of \ninterpersonal interaction.\n\n112 Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nLimitations for Network Expansion\nIn addition to the degradation of physical cues and the absence of some bodily \nexpressive behaviours, the nature of the virtual meeting similarly poses challenges \nfor spontaneous network expansion and strengthening of ties between network \nnodes. While the virtual summit, for example, allows for interactions to occur, these \nare often typically relegated to the realm of the formal. The problem is that it is \noften the informal and spontaneous meeting that leads to cooperation and progress. \nOr, as Tristan Naylor (2020 ) puts it, \u2018These inter-moments are those in which lead -\ners can engage in subtle diplomatic arts between scheduled sessions, and it is these \nmoments that often give rise to the most significant breakthroughs in international \naffairs\u2019. By not allowing for impromptu or unstructured interactions in the corridor, \nacross the street at a park, or in line at Starbucks, much of the value of this type of \ndiplomacy might be lost. As Vincent Pouliot (2016 , p. 129) reports one UN diplo -\nmat\u2019s take on the issue, \u2018Most people see what happens in the conference rooms but \nthat\u2019s not the UN at all. It\u2019s the corridors that determine what happens at the UN\u2019 \n(also quoted in Naylor, 2020 ). At both the level of heads of state as well as lower \nlevels of diplomacy, it is often these interactions on the periphery of the official \nsummit or conference that build relationships. At lower levels, Pouliot, for example, \nnotes the importance of a somewhat anachronistic metaphor: \u2018diplomats cultivate \nsocial ties and build up what they still call, rather obsoletely, their \u201crolodex\u201d  \u2019 (2016 , \np. 128). They do this by engaging in the spontaneous or serendipitous opportunity \nfor an interaction; utilising the \u2018corridors, lobbies, stairways, coffee shops and caf -\neteria of the conference building\u2019 (ibid.; also quoted in Naylor, 2020 ). And crucially, \nthese spontaneous interactions are unplanned and unpredictable, with diplomats not \nknowing who they will meet or, perhaps even more important, be introduced to.\nThe difficulty with digital virtual diplomacy is that the unplanned becomes largely \nimpossible. Video conferences are set up often days or weeks in advance. At the \nUnited Nations Security Council, for example, a meeting on coronavirus took weeks \nto put together, for both technical and political reasons. Further, once scheduled, \nthese meetings are typically meticulously planned with specific agendas. Lastly, \nthere is simply no virtual functional equivalent of \u2018roaming the halls\u2019 to see who one \nmight run into. This precludes the ability to strengthen network ties through sponta -\nneous interaction, but as importantly precludes opportunities to expand diplomatic \nnetworks. This can be particularly detrimental to building coalitions and gaining \nagreement on issues. As Estonian Ambassador Sven J\u00fcrgenson puts it, \u2018WhatsApp \nchats can\u2019t replace the corridor diplomacy for getting consensus\u2019 ( Heath, 2020 ).\nThe nature of video conferencing may also increase or decrease the level of \nformality/informality perceived by the participants, affecting network expansion. \nAs one senior ambassador in London reportedly put it,\nWith Zoom, there is no real interaction, but compromise needs interaction and \ndiplomacy feeds off compromise. It is all far too formal and hierarchical. We \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  113\npress the mute button at the end and we are no further. Everyone has set out \ntheir previous position in 12 monologues. Maybe it\u2019s fine for businessmen, but \nnot for us.\n(Wintour, 2020)\nIn other cases, the interaction may feel too informal. Devoid of much of the sym -\nbolism that surrounds diplomatic visits and the interactions that occur therein, \nan important aspect of the structure of diplomatic interaction is lost. As Matthew \nDavies (2022, p.  6) has argued with respect to the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN), symbols are tightly connected to diplomacy, particularly by \n\u2018shap[ing] the visible, explicit, and public acts of acceptance\u2019. By removing the \nmore formal public displays of symbolism, the \u2018pomp and grandeur\u2019, diplomats \nand leaders may be missing opportunities to reduce uncertainty simply by demon -\nstrating, publicly, that the rituals they have come to rely on as indicators of stability \nwill indeed continue ( Holmes, 2021 ).\nBarriers to Outsiders\nFinally, the inability to effectively exclude outsiders from the interaction poses a \ndistinct challenge for bonding and developing trust in cyberspace. While encryption \nand other security technologies can provide states with some comfort regarding the \nsecurity of their live transmissions, there are several aspects of virtual interaction \nthat make it difficult to socially  delineate who is part of the interaction and who \nis not. The presence of administration officials who are managing the technology \nlikely means that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy during the meetings. \nIndividuals interacting virtually are typically only presented with a relatively small \nvisual field, meaning that they are unable to know with any certainty who is off-\nscreen but still in the room. As one European diplomat puts it,\nThere are now always 10 people sitting in the room. That makes several hundred \npeople in Europe listening .  . . Yesterday there was a video conference for 54 \nwith interior and health ministers. Then you don\u2019t see anyone on the screen.\n(Agence France-Presse, 2020 )\nFinally, leaders and diplomats cannot be sure that a meeting is not being recorded \nand will thus be available to unknown outsiders in the future. \u2018Anyone can record \nthis and pass it on to the press. It\u2019s a completely different atmosphere\u2019 ( Agence \nFrance-Presse, 2020 ). All of these characteristics come together to make it \nextremely difficult or impossible to replicate the private walk or informal private \nmeeting, such as the one Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un engaged in.\nThe barrier to outsiders problem imposes severe limits on the building of trust \nbetween groups where the interaction is taking place in a context of mistrust, and \neven active distrust (we define mistrust as actors neither trusting nor distrusting \n\n114 Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\nanother in relation to a particular issue, whereas distrust is an active belief that \nthey cannot be trusted in relation to this). Bramsen and Hagemann quote one inter -\nviewee who said that just the act of turning off the camera in a meeting left her \nfeeling vulnerable, because\nIt made me have some kind of restriction about what I  can say and to whom \nand why. You know in conflict, the social fabric is completely destroyed, so you \nmistrust people. I  was thinking during my speech: Is he recording, where is he \nstanding, who is listening with him?\n(quoted in Bramsen  & Hagemann, 2021 , p. 10)\nFor trust to grow in such spaces, it is vital that those who are participating in the \nsearch for peace know that they can speak confidentially and that they will not find \nthemselves exposed in their own communities, accused of selling out or treachery.\nIn adapting to this challenge, leaders, diplomats and grassroots activists could \nutilise linguistic/rhetorical or symbolic strategies aimed at substituting for the bar -\nriers to outsiders that exist when actors meet physically. For example, a diplomat \nmight address private information shared only between her and the other in the \ninteraction, in an effort to create a barrier. If outsiders do not have access to the pri -\nvate information, then they will be unable to effectively be part of the interaction. \nSimilarly, leaders might utilise cultural membership capital, by engaging in topics, \nor particular linguistic stratagems, that only other leaders may fully understand and \nappreciate. They might also invoke mutual knowledge, or \u2018I know that he knows \nthat I  know that he knows\u2019, in order to discuss topics without necessarily talking \ndirectly about them. In these instances, outsiders will be able to hear the words that \nare used, but unable to grasp their full meaning. Nevertheless, despite these strate -\ngies, the virtual nature of interaction presents immense challenges for the prospect \nof effectively excluding outsiders to the interaction, both in the present, but also \ncrucially, in the future. As a result, diplomats will often accept the lack of barriers \nand adjust their behaviour accordingly. As one diplomat puts it, \u2018It\u2019s a situation \nthat can lead leaders to have more guarded and prudent language\u2019 ( Agence France-\nPresse, 2020 ). Yet, as the example quoted earlier shows, the inability to exclude \noutsiders is likely to significantly limit the possibilities for building trust between \ngroups that are interacting from a starting point of fear, suspicion and distrust.\nA Mixed Record of Success\nBringing these characteristics of virtual interaction together suggests the immense \nchallenge for bonding and trust development in digitally mediated environments. \nUnable to meet physically and as a result, properly read the cues and nuances of \ninteraction partners virtually, leaders diplomats and negotiators (official and unof -\nficial) alike will not be able to create the key ingredient of bodily co-presence in \nthe Collins model. Consequently, they should have difficulty achieving the mutual \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  115\nentrainment required for positive social bond formation. Further, the inability to \nexclude outsiders means that a second key ingredient is not present, further reduc -\ning the likelihood of bond formation. What is more, these limits to bonding are \nexacerbated by the disruptive problem of how to achieve in digital spaces the \nspontaneous and impromptu social interactions that lead to network strengthening \nand expansion. As discussed in the Introductory chapter to this volume, if digital \ntechnologies are to have enticing  effects, ones where diplomats and leaders are \nencouraged to cooperate and compromise, then they need to be able to replicate the \nenticing features of face-to-face interaction, which, as we have argued, can enable \ntrust-building.\nIt is perhaps not surprising, then, that the early empirical record for virtual \ndiplomacy has been somewhat mixed. While some meetings have been successful \nin \u2018getting to yes\u2019 ( Fisher  & Ury, 1983 ) in terms of agreement, such as the 10th \n(Extraordinary) OPEC and non-OPEC Ministerial Meeting in April  2020, which \nsaw participating countries agree to a number of principles as well as specifical \ncrude oil production steps, it has also been noteworthy what the meetings have \nlacked  in terms of outcomes. As Naylor (2020 ) points out with respect to the G20 \ncommunique, for example:\nthe extent to which individual state interests dominated the G20 communiqu\u00e9 \nfollowing its emergency online meeting is notable. Most illustratively, no new \nfunding announcements were made to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic; \nrather, funding commitments listed by the club were merely an aggregation of \npreviously announced, uncoordinated spending by national governments. The \ngroup also made no specific commitments to support international financial \ninstitutions, failed to acknowledge \u2013 let alone support \u2013 the burden carried by \ntransnational medical non-governmental organisations and refused to increase \nsupport for the World Health Organization. On trade, the G20 failed to reaffirm \nits traditional commitment to resist protectionism and tariffs and left the door \nopen for states to place restrictions on trade in medical supplies, food and other \nessential supplies. The trade paragraph also began with the phrase \u2018consistent \nwith the needs of our citizens\u2019, obfuscatory diplomatic language which gives \nstates cover to do whatever they want in line with particular national interests. \nIt is exactly such particularlist, raison d\u2019\u00e9tat\u2013driven policies, which overall do \nmore harm than good, that multilateral global governance seeks to overcome \u2013 \nnot, as is the case here, uphold.\nIt is of course impossible to know how such an event would have played out in \nperson. Indeed, it may be that the types of egoistic state behaviours would have \nobtained regardless of the mode of interaction. Nevertheless, diplomats and lead -\ners have admitted to the limitations, noting, as the Ambassador of Antigua and \nBarbuda to the United States and the Organization of American States puts it, that \nthe move to digital \u2018is severely limiting the work of diplomacy\u2019 and that it may \n\n116 Marcus Holmes and Nicholas J. Wheeler\n\u2018have a lasting adverse effect on international relations\u2019 ( Sanders, 2020 ). Whereas \nsummitry of the past was, at least partially, about changing  identities, the danger \nmoving forward is, as Naylor puts it, in states merely communicating their interests \nand displaying their identities, rather than engaging with others about them and \ntransforming them.\nOvercoming Digital Challenges Through Habituation \nand\u00a0Adaptation\nWe now return to where we began: the puzzle as to why diplomats and leaders at \nbest marginalise, and at worst dismiss, the trust-building possibilities of video-\nmediated interactions compared to face-to-face interaction when they have man -\naged to build bonds and trust through textually mediated communication for \ncenturies. It may be difficult to identify reasons why video-conferencing would \nbe on an equal or superior footing compared to physically co-present body-to-\nbody interaction,3 but it is equally difficult to imagine that trade merchants in early \nmodern Europe would not have jumped at the opportunity to meet their partners in \nZoom, were such technologies available.\nIn this concluding section, we offer two explanations for this puzzle: one relat -\ning to the nature of evolving technologies and its intersection with politics, and the \nother relating to habituation with, and adaptation to, these changing technologies. \nThe first explanation is straightforward: the nature of technological innovation is \nthat it often creates new problems as it solves others. As Peter Lunenfeld puts it, \n\u2018Every design solution creates a new design problem, and so it is with the ways we \nhave built our global networks\u2019 (quoted in Pew Research Center, 2020 ). The design \nsolution of being able to transmit real-time video images and sound across the \nplanet solves the problem of not being able to see each other and thus solves a core \nlimitation of the telephone, but it does not do away with the old telephonic problem \nof not being able to read the subtle cues of others. Crucially, however, this is only a \nproblem in the sense that it has become an expectation of face-to-face interaction. \nIn past times when bodily co-present interaction was not the norm of diplomatic \nand commercial interaction, there was no experience and hence expectation of the \nsubtle cue reading capabilities that we now know come from body-to-body inter -\naction. This suggests that, in effect, technological evolution creates the very prob -\nlem that it then must solve precisely because as technological development brings \nus closer to simulating co-present face-to-face interaction, the demand  is that this \ntechnological progress provides an equivalence of the signal and cue reading avail -\nable when meeting face to face. In effect, the better and more sophisticated the \ndesign, the more demand is created for even better design.\nThere is a second explanation, however, that relates to habituation and adapta -\ntion. As logic of habit ( Hopf, 2010 ) and practice theorists ( Adler  & Pouliot, 2011 ; \nPouliot, 2008 ) have argued, the quotidian routines of policy officials create taken-\nfor-granted knowledge and stable expectations regarding interactions with salient \n\nCan you Trust in Zoom? Bonds and Trust in Digital Spaces  117\nothers. Put simply, routinised face-to-face interactions create habits of interacting \nface to face and expectations about the nature of diplomacy such that when such \ninteraction is not allowed, it is jarring. Breaking the habits of interacting face to \nface requires iterative video-mediated interactions in order to develop new rou -\ntines and expectations. Concurrently, policymakers have to adapt to the medium \navailable and work with what is there. But as the reflections of diplomats during \nthe COVID-19 pandemic shows, breaking the habit of face-to-face interaction is \nhard for those diplomats who have been schooled in the conviction, in Edward \nR. Murrow\u2019s words, that \u2018The really critical link in the international communica -\ntions chain is the last three feet, which is best bridged by personal contact \u2013 one \nperson talking to another\u2019 (quoted in Burns, 2014 ). Video-conferencing may be an \nimperfect substitute for bodily co-present diplomatic interaction, but as we have \nargued, there are no good theoretical reasons to think that weak bonds, and the type \nof trust this gives rise to, cannot form in digitally mediated interaction just as they \nhave formed through textually mediated communication. Testing this proposition \nempirically is an important area for future research, as is exploring how far the type \nof bonding and trust that is possible through video-conferencing is superior to that \nachieved through other forms of mediated communication.\nNotes\n 1 Though see Fornaciari and Poesio (2013 ) on the possibilities of detecting deception in \ntext-only environments using machine learning through natural language processing \ntechniques.\n 2 It is important to note that there are several conditions under which this occurs and does \nnot occur, though the finding is robust.\n 3 This is not to say that there are not any. One might argue, for example, that heterogeneity \nin diplomat and leader preferences could account for some variation in preferences. Some \nleaders may prefer online interactions, for a variety of reasons, that could conceivably \nthen lead to increased probability of trust-building. These individual-level differences \nwould be worth exploring in future research.\nReferences\nAdler, E.,  & Pouliot, V . (2011).  International practices.

Over 200 multi -\nparty urban networks exist today (Kosovac, Hartley, Acuto,  & Gunning, 2020, \np. 7). The datafication of many of the solutions cities are now elaborating together \nas networks, in part using corporate solutions (i.e., smart city software to make \nmeasurable everything from heat maps, to traffic patterns, to sensor data measur -\nable and comparable and the use of digital twinning to facilitate planning and \nforecasting) creates a new source of power vis-\u00e0-vis their host nation-states and \ninternationally.\nThe degree to which cities can now use data \u2013 and the way in which they have \nsolved development, privacy and storage issues, gives them a new power base: \nthey can prove \u2018what works\u2019 in international public policymaking \u2013 on climate \ninterventions, on pandemic mitigation and a number of other, inter-connected \nareas. As a secondary, but potent effect, these urban networks are now emerging as \neither a supplement, alternative or in some very particular policy areas even as a \ncounterforce to the diplomatic weight of nation-states \u2013 because of the diplomatic \nintelligence they can harness through data and the pressure points in the agential \nprocess they have discovered for themselves. The mounting impact of transnational \nthreats applied to the density, diversity and inequality of global cities puts mayors \nand their bureaucracies on the frontlines of pandemic and terrorism prevention and \nmanagement, climate change mitigation, cyber threats and immigrant integration. \nIn urban centres, because of how density catalyses the effects of these issues, these 5\nMETRODIPLOMACY\nHow Digital Connectivity Can Expand  \nthe Power of Urban Influence\nCathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\n\n122 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nissues are often more vivid and urgent than at the level of the nation-state which has \nhistorically been tasked to tackle such challenges.\nWhile nation-state politics in the 21st century are marked by polarisation and a \nrise of populism, cities remain anchored in practicality and focused on achieving \nefficacy. Though cities compete with one another globally for node dominance in \nthe network of global supply chains, battling for control over a part of the valuable \nflows of finance, technology, knowledge and talent, their leadership has increas -\ningly realised the need to turn co-dependence into a political asset in addressing \ncommon transnational threats. Where urban leaders perceive eroding competence \nor control at the national level, mayors have come to realise that crafting their own, \ndata-driven networks and learning from others \u2013 even cultivating their own \u2018for -\neign policy\u2019 \u2013 is among their greatest assets in an international system strained by \nmyriad tensions, not least the simultaneity of great power competition and global \ninterdependence.\nTheir increasing capacity to see themselves as agents in the international sys -\ntem by building issue-based and interlocking networks (at least in part) results \nfrom their capacity to create, interpret and use data. That capacity, in turn, \nincreases their ability to negotiate vertically with other actors (including with \nbusiness and directly with nation-state governments other than their own) and \nenhances their ability to develop and employ strategies to \u2018win over\u2019 (very) spe -\ncific capacities of states in key circumstances. As Bjola and Kornprobst argue \nin the introduction to this volume in describing the emerging agential process, \nnetworked cities (like some states) have wedged themselves into a plain of verti -\ncal and horizontal negotiation, resulting from the discovery that datafication is \na strategic resource allowing them to consolidate and articulate joint interest. \nTheir capacity to aggregate and analyse data intersects with a definitional shift \nin international relations, towards a more inclusive reading of national security \nthreats, where linkages and dependencies can be weaponised. These linkages \u2013 \neconomic, infrastructure, people \u2013 come together in urban centres. The diagnostic \ncapacities of cities, particularly digitally linked ones, thus become vital sources \nof information and threat mitigation for nation-states, if the latter accept cities\u2019 \nagential capacities. Cities represent an agility in the international system that can \ninfluence the hierarchy of international decision-making in certain areas in the \nmedium term.\nThis chapter will argue that while nation-states will remain the defining entities \nof the arbitration of military and financial power for the predictable future, cities \nare increasingly fulfilling critical tasks of diplomacy: connection, data aggregation, \nanalysis, anticipatory forecasting and information sharing to ensure the security of \ntheir people, their economies and their physical and cyber-networked spaces (from \ntheir power plants to their city grids). As such \u2013 networked \u2013 they have become \nvital contributors to addressing the most challenging, interlocking global issues \nfrom climate impacts to poverty and from disease prevention to cyber security, as \nit affects communities at the local level. They are the seismographs of threats and \n\nMetrodiplomacy  123\nthe incubators of solutions. With their comparatively nimble governance structures \nand direct links to citizen and diaspora interests and outcomes, and more recently \na greater capacity to operate with a view to distinct international interests, nations \nshould see their cities and mayors as the increasingly networked, digitally con -\nnected assets they are.\nThe rapid growth of digital technology has supported individual urban net -\nworks\u2019 ambition to prove their role in international relations, delivering evidence \nof their problem-solving capacities. For the purposes of this chapter, digital power \nis defined as the ability to aggregate data at scale, store, interpret and analyse it to \nassist in planning/strategy, predictive and behavioural (economic) analysis, and to \nuse different sources of connected digital infrastructure to facilitate this work. In \nutilising digital connectivity strategically, urban networks have carved out a valu -\nable resource of power \u2013 influence \u2013 which, next to economic and demographic/\ndemocratic remain cities\u2019 primary methods of political currency with nation-states \nand multinational organisations.\nTheir ability, as Bjola and Kornprobst lay out in the introduction to this vol -\nume, to \u2018deploy datafication methods to understand, predict and generate events \nof strategic relevance\u2019 will make the connected cities of the future more relevant \nas agents in the international system. While their status of a legitimised organising \nsystem gives cities both a greater stickiness in their international collaboration and \ntheir \u2018winning over\u2019 of the nation-state (or the supranational level in the case of \ndirect urban influence on the EU), offering a distinctly different organising impact \nthan transnational advocacy organisations discussed by Nina Hall in this volume, \n\u2018issue volatility\u2019 is real. Not all issues of urban interest are useful in a networked \nstructure when issues such as financial dependence are too often (still) unidirec -\ntional and locked into systemic hierarchy. Further, cities are still unequally party \nto these urban networks. Megacities with digital capacities dominate functional \nnetworks. Where networks are either (a) less issue-bound, (b) less resourced and \n(c) and members more easily manipulable by overarching entities (i.e. in auto -\ncratic systems), these networks become disaggregated or dysfunctional (Cl\u00fcver \nAshbrook  & Haarhuis, 2019).\nNetwork analysis is as applicable here as elsewhere in political science: in-\ngroup and out-group dynamics abound, issue salience matters, cities in democra -\ncies and autocracies can wield different degrees of influence. Much of the level of \norganisation still depends on the capacity of individual mayors or urban adminis -\ntrations to deploy digital technology strategically. Mayors are high-minded as they \nare short-term instrumentalists, depending on political, national and geographic \ncontexts. And yet, to ignore developments among particularly the data-driven and \ndigitally connected urban networks is to ignore an emergent set of actors capable \nof wielding measurable influence and power in international affairs.\nThe development of sub-national power challenges classic definitions of might \nin international relations. Does the combined economic, political (influence), \ndemographic and digital power of cities imply a weakening of the state? Do cities \n\n124 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nretain their dependent status vis-\u00e0-vis nation-states because territorial and defence \nissues remain managed through national governments, or is a flattening multi-actor \nmodel ultimately more helpful to understand the power shifts we might continue to \nsee as entities beyond nation-states contribute ever faster to the solution of global \nproblems? Once the nation-state tackles the issues around which urban networks \nseem to be coalescing, will these simply cease to exist, or atrophy in the way earlier \nefforts at parallel diplomacy of sub-national actors \u2013 paradiplomacy \u2013 have?\nAfter a brief discussion of the elements that constitute urban power, this chapter \nwill trace the development of networked metrodiplomacy as a particular outgrowth \nof sub-national diplomacy. Two examples \u2013 C40 and V oluntary Local Review \u2013 \nwill highlight the capacity of organised cities, powered by data-derived metrics \nderived through digital sources, to shape multinational decision-making. Finally, \nthis chapter will discuss how nation-states might analyse and respond to the power \nof increasingly networked, digitally powered cities as an alternative matrix of com -\npetition, collaboration and active diplomacy towards resolving collective action \nproblems.\nUrban Power: Can It Exist Beyond the City Line?\nGlobalisation has changed the way power is defined and mitigated in the interna -\ntional system (Slaughter, 2017, p.  161ff  ). Military might, financial and economic \npower, information and influence traditionally accorded to the nation-state have \nbeen replaced by a \u2018complex, three-dimensional chess game\u2019 (Hoffmann, 1970, \np. 390ff; Nye, 2010, p.  7), which continues to assert the primacy of the nation-state \nin military power terms (a game now increasingly dominated by the United States \nand China) in the first tier, a secondary tier of the multipolar world of economic \npower and finally a third level of non-state actors, who have harnessed a series of \ntools to participate in the shaping of a more multi-dimensional power architecture. \nThis vertically integrated world design has become punctured and further reor -\nganised horizontally, Castells argued as early as 1996, with the advent of digital \ntechnology that superseded, and in some cases bypassed channels and systems of \nhierarchy and authority (Castells, 1996, p.  135ff.).\nSocial actors \u2013 actors within a society widely defined \u2013 will increasingly seek \nto \u2018establish their power position by constituting a network that accumulates valu -\nable resources\u2019 and define their power by embracing a strong gatekeeping and a \nregulatory function, lest the network be jeopardised by the interests dominant to the \nnetwork\u2019s program, which in turn depends on \u2018ideas, visions, projects and frames\u2019 \n(Castells, 2011, p.  776). Castells identifies four sources of power, which apply to the \ninternational action taken by cities that outstrip earlier efforts of paradiplomacy  \u2013  \nparallel diplomacy by sub-national, non-state entities \u2013 networking power,  network \npower, networked power and network-making power. Networking power  is derived \nfrom the creation and inclusion of members in a global network derived from the \n\nMetrodiplomacy  125\nexclusion of others. Network power  results from the standards that shape the inter -\naction within a network, the \u2018rules of inclusion\u2019. Networked power  speaks to the \npower of some actors within the network hold over others, the type of which is \nunique to each network. Finally, his network-making power  category falls to a very \nspecific and limited set of actors, those who can program specific networks accord -\ning to their own interests and values and derive from that standing the ability to \nswitch networks based on strategic alliances between these dominant actors within \na network.\nAs globalisation has created new linkages, it has reinforced and magnified the \npolitical influence cities can have on a specific set of cross-boundary issues, as long \nas they organise as networks and organise around clearly identifiable goals. More \nso, over the past decade, the degree of influence that cities have been able to carve \nout for themselves vis-\u00e0-vis their nation-states and multilateral organisations can be \nlinked to the extent to which urban networks have either transformed themselves or \nbeen newly created to address very specific issues with policy urgency and metric-\nbased solutions. Cities continue to have to prove themselves as actors in the inter -\nnational arena. As the discussion will show, they increasingly do so by delivering \nproof-of-concept through catalysed data aggregation capacities. The capacity to \ndeliver data on certain, concretely circumscribed issues is an outgrowth of digitally \nsupported urban planning processes that began in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 now, cit -\nies are embracing \u2018digital twin\u2019 modelling to achieve comparability and efficacy \nthrough data towards maximising urban efficiency in everything from wastewater \nto transportation to healthcare delivery. Achieving network cohesion and derived \nnetworking power is directly dependent on cities\u2019 ability to narrow their collabora -\ntive focus and increase their collective credibility using data, aggregated digitally. \nIn short, where cities can transform information into an asset of political power at a \nlarger scale through collective pooling and comparative usage, as Bjola and Korn -\nprobst imply in the introduction to this volume, they add to the \u2018potential to disrupt \nIR at the level of the agency\u2019.\nHowever, as with many international actors \u2013 cities are not created equal \u2013 nor \nare their networks. The discussion of the evolution from paradiplomacy to metrodi -\nplomacy in later parts of this chapter will highlight what the longest-lasting, effec -\ntive urban networks have learned from earlier efforts of subnational diplomacy. \nNetworking power  has allowed for urban alliances to grow quickly and form their \nown node function \u2013 as is the case with the C40 network with its node headquar -\ntered in London \u2013 such that it can even attract cities from authoritarian countries \nwhere information-sharing might not be the cultural norm outside of nation-state \nborders. Both examples discussed in this paper have excelled at creating network \npower : setting rules of inclusion discreetly and demanding member states deliver \nproof to continue group belonging. Networked power  that can influence nation-\nstates, the examples in this chapter will show, remains the domain of megaci -\nties (London, New York, Paris), who are able to hold sway (economic, political, \n\n126 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\ninfluence-setting) over other members of the network. Their dominance in defining \nthe form of an urban network underlines that unless inefficiencies and inequalities \nare addressed as early as the formation of a new form of international architecture, \nurban networks stand to replicate the structural weaknesses inherent in nation-state \nnetworks, that is, multilateral institutions.\nNetwork-making power  can compensate for some of these inefficiencies (as long \nas it is effective, internal inequality might matter less) but is unlikely to be able to be \nas decisive as the other three of Castell\u2019s power definitions in evaluating the resilience \nof urban networks over time. Network-making power in the urban context is reserved \nfor a distinct, few cities and their (former) mayors. The ability to use Bloomberg Phi -\nlanthropies to economically incentivise urban connections or Bloomberg Media \u2013  \nparticularly its CityLab sections \u2013 to highlight the achievements of C40 and other \nnetworked urban initiatives, for instance, is unique to former Mayor of New York \nCity, Michael Bloomberg. It makes \u2018Bloomberg, the man\u2019 a \u2018programmer\u2019 within \nthe web of existing urban networks. His capacities have amplified certain networks\u2019 \ninfluence \u2013 and yet, the longevity, internal functionality, resilience and degree of \ninfluence cannot all be linked to the presence of these individuals. More relevant, \nstill, is the capacity of networks to harness digital and data-driven sources. Where \nnetworks are unable to deliver proof-of-concept and hence create influence, they \noften remain disaggregated and unable to leverage collective power vis-\u00e0-vis other \nentities in the international system (Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook  & Haarhuis, 2019).\nThis makes metrics to assess the functionality of urban diplomacy all the more \nimportant. They include the establishment of representative function (1), the defini -\ntion and protection of citizen and city interest (2), data and information aggregation \nand communication to act on these interests (3) and the active promotion of func -\ntional relations across multiple dimensions (4), that is, city-state, city-region and \ncity to international cities and foreign actors.\nAssessing Urban Power: Ancient Roots, New Definitions\nThe rise of cities as actors in the architecture of international relations, and their \nexpressed desire to be recognised as such in the international system, is a relatively \nnew phenomenon with ancient roots. As \u2018democracy\u2019s original incubator\u2019, the polis  \nwas the foundational organising principle, the roots of monarchy, empire and later \nthe nation-state (Barber, 2013, p.  3). Cities like Venice and Milan \u2013 both backed \nby powerful armies \u2013 took on diplomacy to shape their reality then with first dip -\nlomatic missions abroad, and they are doing it now. Cities were effectively the \nstates of their time. The Hanseatic League of the Middle Ages took urban power \nto a new level. Through economic connections, negotiated trading policies and the \nsupport of military interventions, the League leveraged its economic and political \nclout such that it could \u2018run\u2019 monarchies for significant political gain, and as such \nremains the only historic urban collective to rival what nation-states captured for \nthemselves in the Peace of Westphalia and beyond.\n\nMetrodiplomacy  127\nTerritorial control, in the Hobbesian sense, remained firmly in the hands of \nnation-states for hundreds of years, which allowed the monopoly, use and manipu -\nlation of state-based power to manifest in military and economic might. Today, \nthe \u2018physics of complexity\u2019 (Khanna, 2016, p.  29) has come to dominate the 21st \ncentury\u2019s interconnected, technologically mobilised value chains, globalised lives \nand borderless financial systems \u2013 and thus empowered other actors alongside \nnations (Sassen, 1991, pp. xviiv\u2013xix). Now, nation-states can no longer claim to \nhave the monopoly on the use of militarised violence to control territory (ISIS and \nAl-Qaeda challenged that notion \u2013 lost \u2013 but challenged it nonetheless), nor control \nof information flows (social media has widened that field), nor assert the primacy \nof nation-state currency (digital currencies are at least in part designed to question \nstate control of money) (Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook, 2018; Kilcullen, 2013, p.  52ff; Khanna, \n2016, p.  389ff; Slaughter, 2017, p.  29ff ). Tectonic shifts are afoot in the flow of \npower in international relations, as other chapters in this volume have illustrated, \nforcing nation-states into ever more inclusive engagement with corporations, non-\nstate actors and increasingly with their own and foreign cities as more empowered, \ninternationally connected actors.\nThe US National Intelligence Council concludes that today\u2019s world must be \nclassified \u2018as urban\u2019. Dense, digital connectivity sourced from webs of economic \nactivity, the movement of people, goods and services, among global urban centres \nhas raised the domestic and international power and the aspiration of cities (and \ntheir mayors) to new levels. In their desire to be responsive to citizen needs, may -\nors of well-resourced cities \u2013 New York, Auckland, Hong Kong, London, Paris, \nSeoul, LA and more \u2013 have moved quickly beyond merely the use of digital con -\nnections (including positioning their mayors as powerful voices beyond city hall) \nto strategically using higher-quality, comparative data in the planning, forecasting \nand the international sourcing of solutions.\nDefining the Power of Cities in Contemporary Domestic \nand\u00a0International Relations\nBy 2050, between 55% and 68% of the world will live in cities, compared to 37% \nof the world in 1975.1 Half of the world\u2019s cities of today did not exist in 1975 \n(OECD, 2020, p.  7) \u2013 and metropolitan regions are increasingly merging into fully \nurban areas. Half of the world lives in cities. Global pandemic notwithstanding, \neven the world\u2019s megacities are projected to continue their growth trajectory. The \nworld\u2019s largest cities with over five million inhabitants grew the fastest in terms \nof their own population \u2013 and the number of these cities also doubled over the \npast quarter century (OECD, 2020, p.  6). By 2030, there will be 43 megacities \nwith more than ten million residents each (Ayres, 2018). Cities harness the power \nof their economic connections, their changing political power, their demographic \ncomposition and the capacity of technology to define their interests and engage \ninternationally as individual agents. They also understand themselves as the loci of \n\n128 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nsome of the world\u2019s most challenging problems \u2013 they emit an estimated 70% of \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions, use 80% of global energy supply and consume \n75% of all natural resources (UNEP, 2015; UN-HABITAT, 2011). COVID-19 ema -\nnated from an urban wet market. Terrorist attacks, whether kinetic or cyber, are \nfocused on cities and more often than not are planned in other cities or perpetrated \nby those who felt shut out by the promise of a city. Pandemic disease \u2013 SARS, \nMERS, COVID-19 \u2013 spreads and mutates more rapidly in dense environments. \nInequality is most evident, when and where people live close together. And warfare \nitself, as evidenced across the once-sovereign territory of Ukraine, has become \nquintessentially urban \u2013 with cities supporting other cities in rebuilding, while a \nnation-state takes particular aim at the destruction of urban human thriving.\nIn terms of economic  output, individual cities have long outrivalled other entire \nnations, with 23.9% of global economic output urban based \u2013 and in the United \nStates alone 15 urban centres accounting for all economic activity. It makes the \neconomic viability of cities a key concern at the nation-state level. Cities comprise \n42 of the world\u2019s 100 largest economic entities, demonstrating their large footprint \nin the global economy (Toly  & Tabory, 2016, p.  1), with Chinese cities home to at \nleast eight metropolitan areas that rank among the 100 largest economies (figures \nfrom 2016) and steadily beginning to rival the United States with 12 cities in this \nranking. When as early as 2016, Mexico City and Guangzhou already had eco -\nnomic outputs comparable to the world\u2019s seven largest corporations \u2013 Walmart, \nRoyal Dutch Shell, China Petroleum  & Chemical, Exxon Mobile, BP, PetroChina \nand V olkswagen (at the time) \u2013 it is worth examining how cities might exercise \nsimilar influence nationally and internationally. Some have even argued that the \ncities that compose a nation and the economic power they exercise are more impor -\ntant than the state as an actor itself (Hidalgo, Klinger, Barabasi,  & Hausmann, \n2007, p.  485).\nAdjusted for population, before the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nLos Angeles and New York\u2019s economies ranked among the world\u2019s 20 largest \u2013  \nand will remain there even as the global economy works through the impact of the \npost-pandemic recession (Florida, 2017). Clearly, the economic strength of an indi -\nvidual city cannot be read without its nation-state enabling factors (infrastructure, \ndefence, fiscal redistribution) and the division of labour between urban leadership \nand national government, including members of an urban community chosen to \nserve at the national level. As individual cities, these economic powerhouses can -\nnot exercise as much political influence as rival corporations or even the federal \nstates in which they are embedded. As networked cities, they can do more.\nThe economic power of cities was once dictated by the transportation networks \u2013  \nports, railways, airports \u2013 that connected them with other nodal hubs domestically \nand around the world, financed by redistributed funds from the national govern -\nment. However, cities have found ways of making these investments far more \nvaluable, adding to their own power of influence. Urban scale, the ability to con -\ncentrate linked industries, capital, knowledge (universities), people and technology \n\nMetrodiplomacy  129\ntogether in one urban environment creates the agglomeration economy (Glaeser, \n2011, p.  2ff.), creating a feedback loop among these vectors that classically drive up \nwages (and prices for housing, services, etc.), which then demands direct, people-  \ncentric urban government intervention. And, of course, these cities are in direct \ncompetition with one another for the economic growth, for example, of the tech \nindustry that can continue to power economic growth in cities: Singapore, it a city \nand nation in one, feels justified to have out-run Silicon Valley when it comes to \nfunding the global start-up and innovation economy.\nAs a result of this economic power , modern urban diplomacy has the practical \ntendency to \u2018jump category\u2019: Los Angeles works directly with the Japanese gov -\nernment and the country\u2019s private sector to source \u2018green hydrogen\u2019 technology to \npower the city\u2019s electrical grid, respecting Washington\u2019s laws, but cutting it out of \nthe direct picture, and hosts prime ministers and presidents from Germany, Spain, \nSouth Korea and Canada (Garcetti  & Hachigian, 2020). The former US Ambassa -\ndor to ASEAN ran Los Angeles\u2019 international Affairs for nearly five years, before \nheading back to the US Department of State to run a newly created department \ndedicated to subnational government \u2013 and integrating their intelligence into the \ndiplomatic forecasting of the foreign ministry. LA is but one of many examples \nwhere self-interested cities have not waited for their capitals to take action and \nhave taken matters into their own hands \u2013 and subsequently created change at a \nnation-state level.\nWhere respect for and trust in national political entities internationally has fal -\ntered, cities and their mayors still retain civic/political trust  that imbues them with \nauthority and power vis-\u00e0-vis the nation-state. Institutional trust is at a historic, \nstagnant low around the world at 49%. Americans (52%) are particularly scep -\ntical of trusting government with addressing international crises from pandemic \nmanagement to climate change \u2013 with only 20% trusting government at all. Cities \nretain the image of direct-democratic standard bearers in democracies across the \nglobe (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2020). Where national politics world-over has \ndescended into populism and partisan conflict, cities and their mayors retain the \nhighest approval ratings as non-partisan pragmatists \u2013 at 69% globally and 66% in \nthe United States (Pew Research, 2022). In a 2019 Pew Research Survey, 86% of \nAmericans went further, saying that cities can be \u2018laboratories for trust-building to \nconfront partisan tensions and overcome tribal divisions\u2019 (Pew Research, 2019).\nDirect democracy \u2013 and even the semblance of influence over local decisions, \nas is the case of non-democratic city-state Singapore, for instance \u2013 is associated \nwith greater ethical leadership in public opinion (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2020, \np. 6). Part of the reason cities fall into the crosshairs of nation-state governments is \nbecause they succeed in vividly highlighting nation-state failures. At no point was \nthis more obvious than during the COVID-19 pandemic, when, for example, US \ncities and the Visegrad \u2018Pact of Four Cities\u2019 \u2013 Budapest, Warsaw, Prague and Bra -\ntislava \u2013 were able to self-organise in opposition to their national governments to \ncoordinate the sourcing of PPE and ventilators when national governments slowed \n\n130 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nthe distribution on political grounds (to starve out a left-wing urban leadership \nin a radicalising anti-democratic national context), based on sub-national diplo -\nmacy they had cultivated and technological capacities that empowered them to take \naction quickly, in open defiance of their nation-states (Hopkins  & Schotter, 2019; \nK. Tutto, personal communication, September  16, 2020).\nThe same was true when former US President Trump attempted to deny pan -\ndemic aid to cities who were otherwise not compliant in his political agenda (Edel -\nman, 2020). Or where the mayors, federal states, businesses and NGOs organised \nas part of \u2018America\u2019s Pledge\u2019 and US Climate Mayors are able to uphold America\u2019s \ncommitments to the Paris Climate Change agreement when the United States rel -\negated its leadership role and departed from the agreement in the early years of the \nTrump administration (America\u2019s Pledge, 2020a; Climate Mayors, 2017; Myer, \n2019). Or where cities are seizing the opportunity to harness influence and control \nby joining data-driven networks, even when they cannot afford to purchase a full \nsuite of technology services.\nThe comparatively high civic trust urban leadership enjoys has enabled cities \nto use OpenSource data, address privacy and data management concerns flexibly \u2013  \nsometimes using their in-city resources (universities and research centres) and \nshare that data internationally with impunity. Even the use of Twitter and other \nsocial media channels as a direct form of accountable city governance and urban \ndiplomacy (international outreach), was more quickly adopted by mayors than \nby national leaders and the followership of megacity mayors or former mayors, \nincluding Anne Hidalgo of Paris (1.5M), Eric Adams (1.5M) and former mayor \nMichael Bloomberg of New York (2.6M) and Sadiq Khan (1.1M) can compete \nwith national leaders in terms of their outreach, when scaled for size of population.\nMegacities across the globe retain their roles as the bastions of talent, toler -\nance and technology, all challenges notwithstanding (Florida, 2012) \u2013 and actively \ncompete for these resources, creating demographic power . Movement of people \nattracts input factors that amplify urban agglomeration economies, including uni -\nversities, technology manufacturers and R&D facilities. A  2017 W orld Economic \nForum Study found that 92% of US immigrants live in cities, and 95% and 99% \nof immigrants to the United Kingdom and Australia live in their urban centres, \nrespectively (World Economic Forum, 2017). People on the move \u2013 regardless of \nimmigration status \u2013 want to move to cities. Increasingly, they aren\u2019t moving to the \nnext city in their own country, they are drawn to other, large global cities through \neconomic promise or familial ties, creating a hierarchy of urban nodes in the global \neconomy that move with people (Sassen, 1991, p.  23ff ).\nAfter all, the technology hubs in China \u2013 Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen \u2013 \nwere built by Chinese citizens trained in Silicon Valley. Now Singapore, through \na range of representations in the Valley, actively recruits possible \u2018tech migrants\u2019 \nand their companies to the globe\u2019s most powerful city-state. There is no rea -\nson other, democratic cities couldn\u2019t follow that example. Far removed from \neconomic development agencies of old, BLOCK71, for example, Singapore\u2019s \n\nMetrodiplomacy  131\ntech and recruitment network sponsored by the National University of Singa -\npore, helps promising start-ups from the city-state get access to markets over -\nseas, by presenting itself as a node of information: Singaporean companies have \nrepresentation in Silicon Valley, BLOCK71 can recruit US-trained Singaporean \ntech talent and their companies back home, and it can attract American tech \nFDI to Singapore, functioning \u2018as a global network, enabling opportunities for \ncross cultural learning and collaboration\u2019. While the city-state decides at home, \nwhich tech industries, from AI to agri-food, to self-driving technology, best fit \nits focused planning needs, it \u2018takes a 360-degree view .  . . and puts its entire \n\u201cshoulder to the wheel\u201d  \u2019 to make it happen (Reuters, 2019). New Y ork City has \nbuilt a competitive strategy, to attract and retain tech talent, to expand its own \ntechnological capacity through open-source data usage and by building a tech -\nnology campus at the heart of the city on Roosevelt Island (Cornell University \nPress Release, 2017). When the Trump administration cut down on the number \nof H1B visas available, Boston \u2013 now extremely reliant on fresh, global talent to \npower its biotech industry, created a pooled system to support its businesses to \nexpedite H1B visas. Cities openly use the power of their people to project tech -\nnological power, but they also create multi-actor (NGOs, universities, start-ups) \nurban networks that can compete internationally to satisfy the pressures of global \neconomic flows.\nFinally, cities now command their own digital power  and wield it internationally. \nData-tracking moved into city hall as early as the 1970s, with early experiments in \n\u2018urban cybernetics\u2019 (Flood, 2011, p.  197ff; Townsend, 2013). A  decade later, data \nwas at the heart of new attempts at innovative urban governance, and the merging \nof ICT and urban infrastructure planning (Kitchin  & Dodge, 2011, p.  22). Data-\ndriven urbanism picked up political speed when technological capacities made it \npossible to drive down the cost of technology usage for city halls. Sub-sets of urban \nadministrations, particularly police departments, were already using off-the-shelf \ntechnology to support predictive policing, making available data internationally \ncomparative for use in terrorism prevention. In 2021, worldwide investment in \ntechnology programs for cities reached $135  billion, $511  billion in 2022 and val -\nued to double from that starting point by 2027. The global digital map market size \nalone was estimated at $6.19  billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a com -\npound annual growth rate of 13.0% from 2020 to 2027, powered by the increasing \nuse of AI in map generation. The results are measurable \u2013 consulting group Dalberg \nestimates that for rapidly urbanising India (400  million new residents in its cities \nby 2035), mapping technology alone could reduce carbon emissions by one mil -\nlion metric tons and save 13,000 lives by \u2018creating safer environments\u2019 in terms of \nhousing and transport. Following the COVID-19 pandemic and cities\u2019 desires to \nrethink the use of urban spaces, this figure will likely receive an additional, signifi -\ncant bump (Dalberg, 2019; Kulkarni, 2021). Sensor technology, digital twinning \nin the metaverse, drone surveillance mechanisms, heat mapping \u2013 all of these are \nnow part of \u2018smart city\u2019 packages offered by major ICT companies, who discovered \n\n132 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\ncities as stable and reliable markets after the 2008/2009 financial crisis, which \nshrunk corporate spending on tech expansion (Hartley, 2019, p.  1).\nCities, including those in the global South, now control costs in one of two \nways: Either they invest in \u2018off the rack\u2019 smart city solutions offered by big tech -\nnology companies, including IBM, CISCO and Google, or they invest in govtech, \nsourcing own tech talent and working through the promotion of OpenSource data \nusage \u2013 or a combination of the two. With the catalysing help of technology, Rio de \nJaneiro, Brazil has gone from being an \u2018ungovernable\u2019 and \u2018feral city\u2019, in the early \n2000s (Norton, 2003, p.  2) to running all urban digital operations centre, described \nas \u2018mission control, built for cities\u2019 (Singer, 2013). This development has strong \npositive sides but is not without drawbacks. In the most rapidly urbanising areas \nof the global South, a race for digital supremacy has begun between China and \nWestern technology providers in a new form of \u2018digital colonialism\u2019. Where data \nis the 21st century\u2019s gold, \u2018free\u2019 surveillance software in the hands of governments \nwithout sufficient understanding of data privacy impacts can have deeply anti-  \ndemocratic effects (Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook, 2020) \u2013 and has become a staple of repres -\nsion in Iranian cities by late 2022, with Chinese urban surveillance technology  \nrolling into the country apace. As ever with technology-generated data, who con -\ntrols its flow, who manages it and who owns it remains critical.\nThousands of cities across the world now have both a chief information officer \ncontrolling data and cyber security/privacy issues, a chief resilience officer and \na \u2018foreign minister\u2019, working in concert similar to an inter-agency process in \nnational governments. Singapore\u2019s congestion pricing and emission measurement \nmodel began with simple data aggregation through license plates but has now been \nexpanded to provide emissions and heat data, along with a number of other met -\nrics. With the help of integrated systems to monitor everything from transport sys -\ntems (\u2018smart mobility\u2019), traceability around crime and pandemic spread (\u2018smart \nliving\u2019) and government accountability (\u2018smart government\u2019) and through either \noff-the-rack or custom-built govtech solutions or on the basis of open source data \n(i.e. Open 3-1-1, the comparative data set to track urban responsiveness), cities \nnow have data sets at their disposal with which to engage in shaping international \nbest practice, setting metrics around shared, international policy goals around cli -\nmate, health and security, all while keeping their cities productive, healthy and safe \nat home.\nThe combination of civic authority, participatory data gathering and usage to \nachieve measurable results across policy areas is what city network C40 calls \n\u2018Polisdigitocracy\u2019 (Cosgrave, Doody, Frost, Lawrence,  & Austin, 2015, p.  11). \nHaving citizens actively participate in providing city data and innovation, through \ncrowdsourcing, hackathons, open-source data harvesting and publicly account -\nable data management, is designed to make urban technology more inclusive \n(tech company solutions were often blind to demographic inclusion issues), more \ndemocratically supported and, because of the inclusion of a broader group of \nparticipants, more effective in political advocacy work, particularly on climate \n\nMetrodiplomacy  133\nmitigation. Bringing the citizen in on the ground floor, so the theory goes, will \nmake policy solutions that emanate from this data more actionable and supported \nby the widest group of members in urban society, creating lasting, supporting pub -\nlic change, while driving down costs. Similarly, the availability of open technol -\nogy allows cities to create networks both within its urban confines, with NGOs, \nuniversities, start-ups and beyond. Examples include the civic tech infrastructure \nbuilt by the offices of New Urban Mechanics in Boston or Philadelphia; the use \nof crowdsourcing platform Spacehive, powered by the Greater London Authority \nand other cities in consortium with major energy and technology providers to get \nonly citizen-proposed projects securely funded with local means and other innova -\ntive ways to combine digital and physical urban engagement (Paris, Buenos Aires, \nParis, Mexico City).2 As will be discussed later, urban diplomatic networks \u2013 both \ncity-to-city and nodal arrangements (C40, U-7, U-20; Global Covenant of Mayors \nand the V oluntary Local Review program), rely on this data to build and retain \nstakeholder engagement, to provide proof of concept, vis-\u00e0-vis nation-states and to \nincrease (so long as they are organised into networks for that purpose) their moral \nand political authority in their advocacy work towards countries and multilateral \norganisations.\nHowever, for all the impressive developments at speed and scale, rapid improve -\nments in technology for cities have not always been even: While megacities largely \nexcelled at buying or building the technological capacities they need (often through \ncivic tech fellowship programs or direct partnerships with R&D centres in city uni -\nversities), others are left behind. Outdated technology and insufficient systems to \noperate or modernise technology make cities vulnerable: 70% of all reported ran -\nsomware attacks in the United States target cities and local governments through \ndenial-of-service attacks (Siegel, 2019); the municipal tram system in Dublin; \nStockholm\u2019s air traffic control, powerplants in Johannesburg and Hyderabad \u2013 all \nhave fallen prey to ransomware attacks in the last five years (Muggah  & Goodman, \n2019). For cities across war-torn Ukraine, these are all but hourly realities. In some \ncases, the nation-state has \u2018saved\u2019 these cities, in others they have had to make deci -\nsions that affected their urban bottom line and have paid ransom. In Ukraine\u2019s case, \nmajor American software companies \u2013 Microsoft, Palantir, Starlink \u2013 have come to \nthe rescue of individual cities, infrastructure providers and the nation as a whole. \nIn Singapore, changes in the data management structure have led to the creation of \nthe \u2018transparent citizen\u2019, where its \u2018Smart Nation\u2019 concept will deliver data around \nthe \u2018E3A\u2019, model to the city\u2019s technologists: \u2018Everyone, Everything, Everywhere, \nAll the Time\u2019 (Poon, 2017). The way it has exploited the pandemic tracing technol -\nogy for other purposes demonstrates how quickly a lack of democratic control over \ndata privacy issues can tilt towards the Chinese model, where data tracking in cit -\nies is a key component of the social credit system (Marr, 2019). In fact, Singapore \nand Chinese cities are expressly utilising the trust individuals innately invest in the \nlocal versus the national for questionable, if not corruptive, data practices. Here, \nas discussed later, democratic nation-states eager to benefit from the knowledge \n\n134 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\ncreated by cities towards addressing transnational problems could serve as a cor -\nrecting force, helping to create data accountability mechanisms.\nThe openness to the use of technological solutions to amplify the delivery of \nessential city services and to increase a city\u2019s functionality and capacity to act \nbeyond its borders for the provision of security (both physical and resource secu -\nrity) and greater liveability have created \u2013 20  years on \u2013 an ability to analyse the \nimpact of digital and data power in urban international relations in Europe, the \nUnited States and parts of Asia, and make initial predictions about future possibili -\nties, as discussed later in this chapter.\nYet, in terms of traditional political power, cities \u2013 with rare exceptions \u2013 remain \ntethered to their nation-state system, with little true measurable urban political \ninfluence. City-states, such as in Germany and city-nations, such as Singapore, are \nrare exceptions. In the United States, the Constitution favours rural political power \nover urban \u2013 purposely designed by the Founders but no longer contemporary in \nnature, given particularly the economic clout these cities wield. In short, the Ameri -\ncan political system\u2019s bias is \u2018anti-urban\u2019 (Barber, 2013) and the main political con -\nflict in the country has been described as \u2018urban vs. rural\u2019, and not \u2018left and right\u2019 \n(Rodden, 2019, p.  10ff ), as manufacturing atrophies and knowledge industries in \nthe country\u2019s cities thrive, while some cities \u2018die off\u2019 and others benefit, yet without \nproportional political representation in Congress. Despite an urbanisation rate of \n82%, half of Americans will be represented by only 16 Senators in 2040 \u2013 while \nthe non-urban parts of the country will wield the power of 84 Senators determining \npolicy for the entire country.\nThis division will be the source of future conflict, when it comes to resource \nallocation through taxation and political might in representative democracies, par -\nticularly for those large cities plagued by income inequality, housing shortages \nand crumbling infrastructure, who \u2013 in large federal systems like the United States \ndon\u2019t receive their \u2018fair share\u2019 of federal tax allocation returned from Washing -\nton to tackle these issues apace. This sets up the potential for conflictual relations \nbetween cities and sub-national actors, such as states, and the federal government, \nas cities begin to use their international contacts and their examples to create local -\nised solutions \u2013 such as local investments, expanded participatory budgeting or \nin-state redistribution \u2013 to evade a system that doesn\u2019t grant them representative \npower in accordance with their economic strength.\nFrom Paradiplomacy to Metrodiplomacy\nIf Hedley Bull\u2019s definition of diplomatic action as the \u2018socialization of relations \namong international actors, nurturing a system of rules, norms and common \n expectations \u2013 even between adversaries\u2019 (Bull, 1977, p. 156) holds true, and cit -\nies are increasingly becoming international actors without going through national \ncapitals then it should be of paramount interest of states to create functional ways \nof engaging the international activities that cities have cultivated for themselves. \n\nMetrodiplomacy  135\nThe objective should not be to paternalise or control, but to be able to make use \nof the myriad of self-interest guided ties \u2013 contractual and networked \u2013 cities have \ncreated for themselves over the past decade. Cities are part of a complex diplomatic \nenvironment, where the \u2018national\u2019 and the \u2018international\u2019 are increasingly difficult \nto separate neatly, as globalisation and a shifting threat environment continues to \nblur the lines (Van der Pluijm  & Melissen, 2007, p.  9). For cities, diplomacy must \nbe understood as the \u2018conduct of external relations by official representatives of \ncities with other actors, particularly other cities, nation-states, NGOs and corpo -\nrations\u2019 (Kosovac et  al., 2020, p.  6). If diplomacy must now be thought as more \nmultilevel, \u201821st century statecraft\u2019, from the outset, \u2018complementing traditional \nforeign policy tools with newly innovated and adapted instruments of statecraft \nthat fully leverage the networks, technologies, and demographics of our intercon -\nnected world\u2019, then cities should be key interlocutors for foreign policy institutions \nof nation-states (U.S. Department of State, 2009\u20132017).\nA better understanding of the dynamics of parallel diplomacy (paradiplomacy), \nsub-national diplomatic activity, as it pertains to cities in particular and an appli -\ncation of network theory and the understanding of power flows within networks \ncan serve to better grasp the catalytic role of technology in this complex web, and \nthus, will help in understanding and forecasting the role urban, aggregated \u2013 in \nshort, networked power might play in the future of international relations (Fer -\nguson, 2017). Preferential attachment \u2013 the \u2018tendency for well-connected hubs to \nget even better connected\u2019 (Ferguson, 2017, p.  403) \u2013 implies for urban networks \nthat \u2018success\u2019 in networked political influence vis-\u00e0-vis the nation-state begets suc -\ncess. If powerful cities can imbue urban networks with resources and knowledge, \nwhich states cannot access as easily or politically motivate with the same range, \nthen these node functions can thrive. Even in what seems like a flatter world, hier -\narchies exist: Currently, megacities profit more than the rest from being effectively \nnetworked through node-like structures, such as C40 discussed later. If states and \nother actors want to understand the dynamics of networked, urban diplomacy they \nmust evaluate their effectiveness with an understanding of network interaction, as \nmapped out earlier in this chapter.\nCan Cities Succeed Where Regions Have Fallen Short?\nTo assess the nature and future of cities in international relations \u2013 and to even -\ntually come to a more complete theoretical understanding of their role in global \naffairs \u2013 it is worthwhile to delineate the specificities of metrodiplomacy, which \nhave different origins and hence likely different trajectories than the paradiplomatic \naction of regions detailed later \u2013 the most frequent subject of sub-national govern -\nment diplomatic engagement.\nStudies in multi-level governance and the advent of parallel diplomacy, or \nparadiplomacy, defined as diplomatic and foreign policy activities of political \nagents on a governance level below that of the state, have emerged with increasing \n\n136 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nfrequency since the 1990s (Keating, 1999, p.  2); Michelmann  & Soldatos, 1990). \nEU integration theory has brought forth another set of examinations on multi-level \ngovernance with regions engaging in \u2018multi-layered diplomacy\u2019 in the suprana -\ntional architecture of the European Union, via state-organised institutions such as \nthe European Committee for the Regions \u2013 or, in seeing the entire Union as a \nconglomerate of regions, with other regions in the world, engaging in \u2018complex \ninterregionalism\u2019, through diplomatic means (Hardacre  & Smith, 2009, p.  167 ).\nMotivating factors for paradiplomatic activity include the assertion of rights \nvis-\u00e0-vis the central nation-state (Qu\u00e9bec; Catalonia/Basque country; Scotland: \nGerman L\u00e4nder, some of which are city-states) \u2013 these include rights of repre -\nsentation, language usage and education, economic activity and participation in \nsupra-regional associations \u2013 reflecting both notions of parallelism and subsidi -\narity (Aguirre, 1999). Already, this is a strong difference in political motivation in \ncomparison to the networked actions of cities, who are pragmatic problem-solvers, \nlooking to address specific issues in either city-to-city or urban networked for -\nmats and seem to care less about traditional vestiges of hierarchical power being \naccorded to them.\nParadiplomacy is classified as \u2018the extension of specific domestic situations \nor conflicts, which are manifested through and embodied in, institutional frame -\nworks\u2019, and not designed or thought of to create international presence simply as \na demonstration of power and influence (Lecours, 2002, p.  93). This interpreta -\ntion explains why so many regions that imitated Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s model in its push for \ngreater independence from Canada \u2013 the establishment of trade representation and \nother regional institutions, coupled with an attempted triangulation [in Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s \ncase, by leaning heavily on its relationship with France to extort political rights \nfrom Ottawa] \u2013 ultimately failed. In the 1980s, the Qu\u00e9bec-model led to a flurry \nof non-central government contacts of paradiplomatic nature (Alvarez, 2020, p.  2), \nbut because they were established without clear political intent or pre-established \npolitical interest (independence was rarely the declared goal) that spoke to the \ninstitutional structure \u2018at home\u2019, these were shuttered over the following 20  years \n(Keating, 1999, p.  2ff ).\nAt the same time, supporting the argument of institutional power in the context \nof paradiplomacy, nation-states reacted to the advances of dependent regions by \nstrengthening regional institutions that could, effectively, subsume regional inter -\nests and steer them more effectively towards an international policymaking process. \nThese exist at the national level (U.S. Governors Association; National Association \nof Regional Councils) or at the supra-national level (100 Euroregions; Merco-Cit -\nies [Mercosur] Committee of the Regions; Council on Europe Congress of Local \nand Regional Authorities; and in different formats at the UN level]. Because of \ntheir compounding influence, they have become the target of foreign policy action \nby other nation-states, particularly China, looking to expand investment in Europe \nand the United States (Allen-Ebrahimian, 2020). China picks these regions off to \n\nMetrodiplomacy  137\neffectively instrumentalise their associations and individuals within them to do its \nbidding versus nation-states.\nIn short, paradiplomatic action by states and regions has most frequently created \naffinity, rather than issue-based networks, to contest, or at least engage with ques -\ntions of subsidiarity and governance vis-\u00e0-vis the nation-state. Where nations have \nfelt threatened, they have paternalistically created networks for regions, to create \navenues of consultation, but also to control their radius of engagement.\nThe premise of metrodiplomatic networks around specific transnational issues is \nprecisely inverse. Here, the thinking is that the nation-state should be more active \non behalf of the whole \u2013 whether it is on environmental/climate issues, develop -\nment, security or human rights \u2013 but it is failing to \u2018act in time\u2019, which prompts \ngreater, independent action by cities. City networks have not formed to make gen -\neral assertions of governance; they are looking to exchange data/metrics and best \npractice to then define joint advocacy action to catalyse concrete, coordinated inter -\nvention by nation-states.\nModern metrodiplomacy, as a potential subset of paradiplomacy, has a similar \norigin, but a different political outcome, in part because of the catalytic power of \ndigital technology. Coordinated city interaction began in the 1970s with the UN \nConference on Human Settlement, HABITAT, convening cities from all over the \nglobe. Through today, HABITAT focuses on managing migration and sustainable \nurban design, creating the roots of muscle memory of urban collaboration now at \nplay in metrodiplomatic networks. In parallel, beginning slightly earlier, citizen \ndiplomacy formats were being developed to link cities nationally and internationally \nin sister city relationships, with \u2018soft power\u2019 objectives of further person-to-person \ncontact, linguistic and cultural exchange and benefiting economic development. \nThese exchanges laid important acculturating groundwork for city-to-city collabo -\nration but are a far cry from the interest-driven and data-driven _impetus behind \ntoday\u2019s urban networks. Cities economic, political and demographic rise and inter -\nconnection through globalisation and the acute nature with which that brought \ntransnational challenges to city hall fundamentally changed the way mayors saw \ntheir interactions with national and international counterparts.\nToday, issue-oriented urban networks, based around interests and concrete \ngoals, have the capacity to outpace national city organisations, such as the US Con -\nference of Mayors, in their effectiveness to command nation-state and multilateral \norganisation attention. The networked structure is underpinned by an entire caste \nof \u2018superstar\u2019 mayors, who have realised the potential of their own voice and stat -\nure in international affairs, imbued by the strength of their cities as nodes of eco -\nnomic and \u2018people\u2019 power projection. Michael Bloomberg has led this group with \nhis personal investments in building functional network nodes, actively catalysing \nuniversity and NGO support for many of these networks (through his philanthropic \ninvestments in leading US research universities and Bloomberg Philanthropies, \nwhich culls urban best practice by \u2018rewarding\u2019 urban innovation with cash prizes).\n\n138 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nIn Asia, now deceased Seoul mayor, Park Won-Soon, had established himself \nas an international leader, most recently convening mayors, public health officials, \nuniversities and private companies for the world\u2019s first COVID-19 mayoral summit \nconcluding with the proposal of the \u2018Seoul declaration\u2019, on solidarity around climate, \nhealth, energy, education and smart city business by cities for cities, with 42 mayors \ncommitting to closer cooperation. Sadiq Kahn became a vociferous interlocutor for \nhis city\u2019s EU citizens and a welcome figure in Brussels as he tried \u2013 for years \u2013  \nto keep \u2018London open for business\u2019, using all resources at his disposal. Building \non bi-lateral ties of interest-driven, pragmatic politics \u2013 which continue apace \u2013 to \naddress individual urban concerns, from building sea-level rise resistant airports, or \nexchanging information on global PPE sourcing in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 these \nmayors have taken leadership roles in urban, data-driven networks that, with one \nrare exception (the Global Parliament of Mayors) have as a goal to address single-\nissue problems. Their goal is thus not necessarily to establish permanent institutions, \nas is part of the goals of region-based paradiplomacy, but to bring to bear the cumu -\nlative expertise of cities around issues, ideally to put themselves out of business \u2013 \nwith the challenges of climate change, terrorism and pandemic prevention resolved.\nAs van der Pluijm and Melissen point out, \u2018city actors do not necessarily ride \nalong different diplomatic routes, but rather along the same route although in a dif -\nferent car\u2019 \u2013 arguably a much faster car (Van der Pluijm  & Melissen, 2007, p.  9). \nCities have become active international actors in security, economics, climate and \nenergy matters (including planning), health policy, development, migration, human \nrights and democratic defence, precisely because of their innate linkage and the \nimpact they have on a city\u2019s progress. All of these issues have direct, urban policy \ncounterparts, from law enforcement, to investment screening and income distri -\nbution/inequality measures, to transportation and housing, to health infrastructure \nand hospital management, to fairness and equality of access, to integration and \ncommunity-building and to equality in the law. Cities have come to shoulder both \nthe local and international demands of these issues and become effective, two-level \nnegotiators in the process, though shortcomings remain.\nIn fact, where goals have been less defined, or where \u2018clean data\u2019 can be influenced \nby cultural, social and economic factors, including norms and rights, networks become \nless sticky over time. Human rights and immigration-focused urban networks, for \ninstance, have proven less resilient, when compared to networks whose work centres \naround development, climate change or security, where interests can be more strin -\ngently defined and measured (Marks, Modrowski,  & Lichem, 2008, p.  47ff.).\nAssessing Networked, Urban Diplomacy \u2013 City-to-City and Urban \nNetworks\nI have my own army in the NYPD, which is the seventh biggest army in the \nworld. I  have my own State Department, much to Foggy Bottom\u2019s annoyance. \nWe have the United Nations in New York, and so we have entered into the \n\nMetrodiplomacy  139\ndiplomatic world that Washington does not have. \u2013 Michael Bloomberg, former \nMayor of New York City.\n(Walker, 2011)\nThe previous discussion has highlighted how cities\u2019 power overall has shifted in \nthe international system \u2013 despite obvious differences in power projection, depend -\ning on size, resources, embedded national construct and leadership \u2013 and how an \nincrease in digital urban administration has created more ability and agility for \ndirect contact between cities, more avenues for influence in a crowded political \nagenda \u2013 as mayors remain or extend their image as (the last) trusted actors in \ngovernment \u2013 and a greater ability to compare, scale and implement solutions to \ntransnational problems.\nCities have engaged in city-to-city diplomatic relations since the creation of \nthe polis . They are \u2018ineluctably interdependent and naturally relational, not just in \nthe modern context of global interdependence but by virtue of what makes them \ncities\u2019 (Barber, 2013, p.  113). Now, urban diplomacy has come into the modern \nage. Urban-led networks can preserve international agreements that nation-states \nhave stepped away from, proven by the hundreds of urban, non-profit, business, \nstate-level and philanthropic partners that have underwritten \u2018America\u2019s Pledge\u2019, \nthe commitment to upholding the goals formulated by the United States in its com -\nmitment to the Paris Climate Change agreement even after the Trump administra -\ntion formally declared its intent to leave it. While surely the United States would \nbe in better shape if it had never left the agreement \u2013 and scientists are critical of \nwhat these types of climate networks can really muster in the absence of national \npower behind them \u2013 surely the international realm would be worse off had all \ngoal-setting and practical action on mitigating and preventing the harmful effects \nof climate change fallen flat over four years.\nCities have foreign representations, they lead trade delegations, they sign Mem -\noranda of Understanding and compacts with one another, negotiated over different \nrounds, expressing common and different interests. They hire former ambassadors \nor foreign policy professionals as their diplomats.3 Megacities from London, to \nParis, to New York, Singapore and Shanghai fulfil all four of the criteria listed \nearlier across a number of sectors, for other rapidly urbanising environments, the \ncosts of international presence and connection still often outweigh the benefits. \nGiven the direct impact urban action can have on issues from climate change to \ndevelopment, as discussed later, lifting up particularly cities in the global south to \nparticipate in city-to-city or networked urban diplomacy should be a joint objective \nof nation-state and multilateral diplomacy, through the Sustainable Development \nGoals, but also as part of an ambitious global agenda for a new Office of Subna -\ntional Diplomacy at the State Department (introduced by bipartisan bill in 2019) \nand installed in 2022, that is, the new Urbanisation initiative at the German Foreign \nOffice (Lieu  & Wilson, 2019).\n\n140 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nCities that are large and powerful enough now \u2018jump category\u2019 (not merely \ncity-to-city but also city-to-nation) powered by an increased need to find cost-\nefficient, technology-driven solutions: Los Angeles cuts out the Washington, D.C. \nmiddleman to work directly with the Japanese government and its private com -\npanies to implement \u2018green hydrogen\u2019 technology to deliver zero-carbon energy \nto LA\u2019s electrical grid; Colombian city halls work directly with the Dutch gov -\nernment on integrated water management, canal structure and irrigation. A  sim-\nple WhatsApp group run by mayors\u2019 offices in early spring 2020 coordinated \nthe sourcing of PPE for their urban hospitals \u2013 while bypassing national capitals \n(Garcetti  & Hachigian, 2020).4\nWhere cities individually cannot create this leverage, they define themselves \nmore by building \u2018bridging capital\u2019, hooking them up with domains outside their \nboundaries, than through \u2018bounding capital\u2019, unifying them internally (Barber, \n2013, p.  113). \u2018America\u2019s Pledge\u2019, which connected cities, federal states and busi -\nnesses or the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s now concluded 100 Resilient Cities, which \nfunded and connected Chief Resiliency Officers in cities that could not otherwise \nafford such positions, and the Harvard Kennedy School Bloomberg City Leader -\nship Initiative, which trains new dozens of newly elected, international mayors \neach year in how best to tackle inter-agency, interdisciplinary problems as a cohort \nfrom across the globe are but a few examples. Technology has catalysed the ability \nfor Singapore, Boston and San Francisco to work on their airport designs as much, \nas it has enabled hundreds of NYPD officers embedded in foreign city police forces \nas part of the International Liaison Program and the NYC Counterterrorism Unit \n(referenced by Mayor Bloomberg above) to prevent New York City from another \ncataclysmic terrorist attack. Much more is possible, if the nation-state level fully \nrealises the potential of robust city-to-city networks and begins to capitalise on the \nintelligence these generate while refraining from attempts to subsume them into \nnational structures. As a number of analysts have suggested, urban intelligence will \nbe vital in rebuilding Ukraine such that it truly can \u2018jump category\u2019 to a green and \ntechnology-driven future as it rebuilds its cities following an eventual end to the \nwar and a restoration of sovereignty (Roggof et  al., 2022, p.  26).\nUrban security and terrorism prevention is precisely an area in which city-to-\ncity collaborations could be expanded and productively linked to produce multi-\nlevel, holistic crime and anti-terror strategies, supporting local law enforcement \nand national intelligence to cooperate. For decades, NYPD officers have been \nembedded in foreign policy forces from The Hague to Tel Aviv to Sydney (Dienst, \nMcHugh, Ing,  & Neubert, 2016; Winston, 2018). As a result, the NYPD was able \nto immediately step up the security of French institutions following the Paris ter -\nrorist attacks in 2015 and train Amsterdam security officials on counter-terrorism \nstrategies for its city\u2019s marathon after the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. As \ncities continue to be the main targets of kinetic warfare and cyber acts of terrorism, \nurban institutions, including law enforcement-linked intelligence should be better \n\nMetrodiplomacy  141\nprepared to operate in a world in which perpetrators are often lone wolves, radi -\ncalised through the provision of extremist content via technology. Urban security \nactors are the first on the scene: profiting from international best practice, from \ntraining with international colleagues supported by the kind of technology that \ncan provide collective urban intelligence, and practical training on first-reaction, \nresponse and investigation, striking a balance between data collection and civil \nliberty successfully, in part because urban authorities are so much closer to citizens \n(Ljungkvist, 2019, pp.  3\u20134).\nFollowing a double-zipper principle, responses to violent extremism, terrorism, \ncrime, political violence and social tension could be tracked, traced and inter -\npreted at the local level, where they are likely to play out and coordinated up and \ndown the institutional value chain, urban and international first, then with national \nintelligence and law enforcement and where appropriate with multilateral bodies \nincluding Interpol, NATO, Europol and anti-corruption and anti-trafficking enti -\nties. This should work up and down the zippered chain. NGOs and universities \nhave a role to play in providing research that allows for the removal of bias from \nthese processes (NYPD\u2019s CompStat crime statistic software is seen as a failure for \nits inability to do so) and maintaining public accountability and the protection of \ncivil liberties.\nAssessing Networked, Urban Diplomacy \u2013 Urban Networks\nTwo case studies demonstrate that, in particular, tightly circumscribed political \nareas such as climate change and development, networked urban action \u2013 pow -\nered by data \u2013 has surpassed nation-state capacity to remain accountable. These \nnetworks have created a power source all of their own (networking power), which \nmakes them useful to nation-states moving forward. To be both successful and \nuseful to nation-states and other sub-national entities, digital, urban networks must \nnot always follow the same model, but they need to be interest-driven and issue \nbound. As Castells (2011, p.  776) underlines, network power implies the creation \nof standards and rules of inclusion. Within strict issue boundaries, these are easier \nto achieve. Networks that embrace a more \u2018paradiplomatic\u2019 approach, pushing \n\u2018simply\u2019 for more urban consideration in international policymaking seem to be \nless measurably \u2018successful\u2019 in creating engagement and partnership-based accept -\nance by the nation-state level, which should be a goal of urban networks: Not to \nbe subsumed by nation-state frameworks built around these initiatives to appease \nthem, as was the case for paradiplomatic structure of the 1970s\u20131990s, but to \nbecome serious political stakeholders \u2013 as networked actor nodes \u2013 in their own \nright, on the basis that they can deliver data-bound solutions to issues such as the \nmeasurable reduction of emissions, the provision of effective terrorist deterrence \nor the reduction of pandemic spread, supported by civic trust and authority, faster \nthan the nation-state.\n\n142 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nExample I: C40 and the Compact of Mayors\nOn climate policy, a number of urban networks have emerged, all with a central \nnode and organisational stewardship, including C40, the Global Compact of May -\nors (the \u2018contractual\u2019 obligation that binds C40 members with those of ICLEI and \nanother, large urban network) and US Climate Mayors. Membership in these net -\nworks overlaps, creating synergistic effects in the best-case scenario, duplication \nand network fatigue in worse cases (Kosovac et  al., 2020, p.  20). What allows them \nto retain their \u2018stickiness\u2019 is the central stewardship, metric guidance, resource \nsharing and power amplification these networks provide. Here, the degree of net -\nworked power \u2013 the power that some members hold over others \u2013 and network-\nmaking power, the ability of actors within the network to program these networks \nbecomes vital to assessing which of these groupings will thrive and which falter.\nWith 97 affiliated cities covering 25% of the world\u2019s GDP, C40 sees itself as a \nnetwork, a data hub and an accelerator in the race to find functional solutions to the \nintegrated challenges of climate change. It measures its own success in influence \n(and aggregated emissions data), noting that \u2018one third of the actions member cities \nreported were directly influenced by collaboration between cities and 70% of C40 \ncities have implemented new, better or faster climate actions as a result of partici -\npating in C40 networks\u2019, with its four-pronged strategy to connect city officials, \ninspire by way of example-setting, advise and influence the national and interna -\ntional policy agenda.5 Its intelligence network is specifically designed to support \ncities in the design of data networks and privacy management, so that scientific \ndata can be easily shared and compared.\nBefore COVID-19, 27 of the world\u2019s largest cities, all members of the C40 net -\nwork, reported that they had successfully reduced emissions over a five-year period \nby 10%. City halls in places like Berlin, Warsaw, Los Angeles and Melbourne \nreached this crucial milestone despite increasing population numbers while still \nproviding robust urban economic growth. These cities have continued to decrease \nemissions by an average of 2% per year since the 2012 peak, while their economies \ngrew by 3% and their populations by 1.4% per year on average.6 In the COVID era, \nthe network immediately pivoted to create a new intelligence hub on urban adapta -\ntion to acute pandemic management, while addressing issues of inequality, density \nmitigation and climate-conscious post-pandemic planning to its work stream.\nWhile Bansard, Pattberg, and Widerberg (2017, p.  239) display well-founded \nscepticism on the absence of publicly available, specific data on individual emis -\nsions paths to truly compare the ambition levels of C40 members across the entire \nmembership, its diplomatic achievements (along the four criteria established ear -\nlier) hold nonetheless:\n(1) It has a strong representative function with its physical hub in London and \nissue-bound networks supported by the data aggregation and evaluation capaci -\nties within the hub; (2) it clearly defines its mission as protective of citizen and \n\nMetrodiplomacy  143\ncity interest; (3) its data and information aggregation capacities are unsurpassed \nfor a stand-alone urban network and (4) it has actively engaged to promote func -\ntional relations across multiple dimensions, fostering its concept of \u2018polisdigi -\ntocracy,\u2019 to expand its membership increasingly toward the global South.\nThe network has also undertaken multi-lateral, multi-stakeholder diplomatic \nefforts in the creation of the Compact of Mayors, a negotiated agreement by city \nnetworks, including ICLEI and United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG/\nCGLU) \u2013 partnering with the Covenant of Mayors (the network of thousands of \nEuropean mayors to rapidly advance on Europe\u2019s climate change agenda) and \nsupported by the UN \u2013 to make inter alia , annual reporting data on local climate \naction \u2018publicly available\u2019 and to establish \u2018robust and transparent data collection \nstandards\u2019, including a commitment to compliance with the negotiated agreement \n(Compact of Mayors, 2014). It has leveraged the influence it has built, as a respon -\nsible international actor might, to source funding and support to engage in a type \nof development policy: With support from several European national governments \nand philanthropic funders, it is providing in-depth technical assistance to over 37 \nprimarily Global South cities across C40 regions.\nMembership in C40 has exogenous effects of multiplying urban diplomatic \npower, but it also has endogenous effects on the functionality of urban admin -\nistration at home. A  combination of the public trust it engenders because it is \nsupported, financed and utilised by cities and mayors; the fact that it maintains \nrevolving political leadership by a mayor, with a node entity run by a bureaucracy \ncapable of steering data aggregation, privacy protection and responsible data stew -\nardship, and the fact that the collaboration between cities has led to actual results \nin the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions that outperforms the comparative \nachievements of individual nation-states have made this network an equal part -\nner in the multilateral framework. Despite oft-cited network fatigue, cities within \nthe network now have a trust-based way of working with one another that has \nenhanced mutual trust in bilateral urban diplomatic interactions.7 No COP since \nParis without C40 and its constituent entities might be a summary of its exogenic \neffects. The endogenic effects are characterised by the fact that the engagement of \ndifferent levels and different functions of urban bureaucracy further inter-agency \ncooperation \u2018at home\u2019. Or: The Biden administration can rejoin the conversation \non ambitious standard setting as part of COP26 in part because a joint initiative \nled by America\u2019s mayors, engaged in C40, saved US international credibility and \nmore importantly its actual commitments to reducing the long-term effects of cli -\nmate change (America\u2019s Pledge, 2020b). In short: membership in C40 creates syn -\nergies in city hall that weren\u2019t there before (comparable to an inter-agency process \nin a national government) and that culture shift has begun to outlive individual \nleadership.\nFinally, C40 is a clear example of network-making power, exemplified in the \npersonage of Michael Bloomberg, who was instrumental in launching it, using his \n\n144  Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nmedia influence (Bloomberg\u2019s own CityLab) to showcase the network\u2019s progress \nand who could, once this network had matured to where it no longer served his \npersonal interests as directly, \u2018switch\u2019 (Castells, 2011, p.  784) to building and sup -\nporting another network that better served his interests at the time (\u2018America\u2019s \nPledge\u2019), only to then serve as the bridging factor between these two networks, \ntowards forming a functional, strategic alliance to influence both the international \nlevel (UN/COP) and the US domestic environment, where the national govern -\nment in Washington under Trump had decided to abrogate from the Paris Climate \nChange agreement and deny the very scientific and data-driven proof around the \nfunctionality of emission controls C40 has been pushing since its inception.\nIs it a replicable and sustainable model in that way? No. Too great were the \ndependencies on the stand-alone figure of the former New York City mayor. Does \nthat imply that less hierarchically (networked power) structured organisations can -\nnot be as resilient over time, invalidating the thesis of growing urban influence over \ntime? No, as the second example demonstrates. However, it does underscore the \ndegree to which all criteria for a functional, digitised urban network still need to be \nmet to create influence comparable to that of individual nation-states on a specific \ntransnational issue. It does not invalidate the claim that cities who remain engaged \nin metrodiplomacy can\u2019t be useful to the nation-state or multilateral level, as the \nvalidity of cities\u2019 on-the-ground data collection, pattern observation, sensor track -\ning all remain just as valuable to the host nation, if it is able to capitalise on this \nexisting intelligence. Conversely, major policy failures can occur when that link -\nage is not heeded, as the 2022 example of the city of Hamburg shows. Its former \nmayor \u2013 now German Chancellor \u2013 had begun negotiation with Chinese container \ncompany COSCO under the radar of national officials. As the deal came to a close \nunder a new mayor, and against the consolidated wishes of the German cabinet, \nthe now-Chancellor (former mayor) of Hamburg, Olaf Scholz, used the executive \npower embedded in his national role to realise a single business deal that could \nendanger national security, through the arrival of additional Chinese-build technol -\nogy embedded in Europe\u2019s second-largest container port.\nExample II: Sustainable Development and the Voluntary Local \nReview (VLR)\nThe example of the VLR, one of the newest urban networks, underlines that \nfunctional alliances can follow a different pattern to still create influence and \ndiplomatic value in international relations. Developed by New York City\u2019s Com -\nmissioner for International Affairs, Penny Abeywardena, and her team embedded \nin the UN building on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, the goal for the creation of \nthe V oluntary Local Review to supplement national review processes towards \nthe achievement of the UN\u2019s 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is \nsimilarly based in a desire to leverage urban advances in evidence-based poli -\ncymaking and the use of data as a means to identify gaps and mobilise new \n\nMetrodiplomacy  145\npolicy, partnerships and resources. A  secondary goal was to create \u2013 for New  \nYork \u2013 a goal-setting mechanism that aligned its strategic plan with the UN goals \nas an additional accountability mechanism for different entities of NYC\u2019s urban  \nadministration \u2013 again, exogenic and endogenic effects. Further, the development \nof the VLR process, that aligns metric-based, digitally accountable urban planning \ngoals with the SDGs, represents a further way for cities to liberate themselves \nfrom the paternalistic view of their international capacities as seen by member \nstates. SDG 11, for instance, has a \u2018cities\u2019 goal \u2013 to create \u2018inclusive, safe, resilient \nand sustainable cities\u2019. Only Commissioner Abeywerdana\u2019s office pushed back, \nwithout the active engagement and participation of economically, demographi -\ncally, technologically and civically powerful \u2013 and rapidly growing cities \u2013 the \nentire SDG agenda would be unrealisable. Abeywerdana saw the timebound out -\ncomes of the SDGs as an ambitious and common \u2018North Star\u2019, pulling together all \nurban interest areas (Pipa  & Bouchet, 2020, p.  6).\nDesigned as a tool of metric-driven alignment, the V oluntary Local Review \nexercise is sequenced in four steps \u2013 awareness [of the SDGs], alignment [of \nurban strategy and planning], analysis [of existing capacities and aims], action \nand accountability. Its value proposition is to offer, through a baseline structure \n[highly customizable] a tool for better organisation of policy, increased internal \npolicy coherence and coordination [the inter-agency process], the setting of time-\nbound, measurable targets and the application of data to solutions with the aim \nof engaging diverse stakeholders, who, through digital means, participate in data \naggregation with the wider goal of amplifying influence in global policy. Again, \nthe alignment of urban interests and measurable, time-bound priorities, coupled \nwith multi-stakeholder support architecture to this network of 17 \u2013 from the Brook -\nings Institution, to Carnegie Mellon, to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs to \nthe data-driven support of an LA created \u2018GitHub SDG Wiki\u2019 and a comparative \ndata hub, sponsored by the Thematic Research Network on Data and Statistic \n(TReNDS) and other partners that create a data hub, a dashboard structure and a \nmeans to aggregate third-party data, while providing microgrants to seed and sup -\nport data innovations in cities whose resources would otherwise be too constrained \nto participate, fulfils the criteria of functional, urban networked diplomacy.8 While \nan initial Brookings assessment notes, data inputs vary and will need more review \nmoving forward (smart city capacities are not equally available across all 17 mem -\nbers), more sophisticated analysis and modelling will be able to achieve greater \ncomparability and equitable assessment (Pipa  & Bouchet, 2020, p.  18ff ). Here, too, \nthe unifying data node is outsourced to a third party, but unlike C40, city stakehold -\ners themselves provide the accountability.\nWhile the VLR is young, it fulfils all four criteria of diplomatic urban action, \nwith the establishment of two representative functions \u2013 physically at the UN \n(though, under the VLR portfolio of New York City Commissioner\u2019s office) and \nin its data hub (1) its alignment of nation-state defined SDGs with urban priorities, \ndefining and raising the protection of citizen and city interest (2) setting metric \n\n146 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nbased goals to act on these interest (3) and actively building functional relations \nacross multi-agency organisations, from NGOs, to academic institutions to urban \nagencies internally (4) with the joint goal of measurably increasing its impact on \nthe national and multinational level. Again, the early conveners, who set the norms \nand guidelines for a network, even one that has shared deliverables but a different \npathway of achievement for each city, steer the degree of influence. Both C40 and \nthe VLR process uphold a friendly, pragmatic but nonetheless competitive angle \nto their work, reflecting the basic nature of cities in the international environment.\nAs more comprehensive, comparative urban network analysis shows, diplo -\nmatic urban networks fray when a mission statement is less specifically defined, \nwhen data-drive metrics play less of a role in accountability and where, similar \nto traditional paradiplomatic action, the achievement of greater power or greater \nrecognition is a goal in itself. As with every organisation, leadership matters, joint-\ngoal setting and an inclusive playing-field matter.\nAs such, the Global Parliament of Mayors \u2013 introduced with much fanfare after \nthe publication of Benjamin Barber\u2019s book, \u2018If Mayors Ruled the World\u2019, falls \nshort of expectations: both membership and working areas are too broad; goal-\nsetting is not clearly defined and leadership is diffuse. It defines itself as a \u2018conduit \nfor mayors to build partnerships and collaborate toward meeting local challenges \narising from global problems\u2019. Given all we have seen cities can achieve on their \nown in city-to-city networks and through more nodal, hierarchically set networks, a \nconduit function seems nary enough to assert political power in contested environ -\nment.9 The Global Parliament of Mayors will not serve a supra-national ordering \nfunction in 21st-century international relations.\nThough it is too early to tell, many have high hopes for a \u2018network of networks\u2019 \nthat addresses the economic power of cities more directly. Analysts hope that the \nU-20 \u2013 the urban offshoot of the G-20 \u2013 could contribute to a novel ordering struc -\nture that takes rapid globalisation and urbanisation and a greater understanding of \npower within diffuse, issue-oriented networks to the most economically powerful \nnation-states. Created in 2018 by C40 and United Cities and Local Governments \n(UCLG), also party to the Compact of Mayors, this network is to subsume the \nissue-bound work on climate action with access to multilateral and national finan -\ncial organisations for cities (Klaus, 2018), indicating cities, in catalysing solutions \nto global issues with greater speed, efficacy and accountability than nation-states, \nwill want to be more deeply engaged in novel financing concepts for the imple -\nmentation of the ideas from the city outward, that will, in fact, address the most \npressing issues of our time.\nThe Role of the Nation-State\nHow should nation-states react to the rapid evolution of urban, digital networks \nthat eclipse the speed of their implementation of international solutions to trans -\nnational problems with greater accountability and civic engagement? By offering \nMetrodiplomacy  147\npower-sharing partnership. Cities are of nation-states and their success is national \nsuccess. Early warning on terrorism and security threats; mitigation of seawater \nrise with destructive impacts on communities; sensor data on the movement of \npeople from city to city to prevent human rights dilemmas \u2013 if cities are more \ncapable of tracking, aggregating and taking initial action on these issues in a way \nthat does not make them overly dependent on specifically owned technology that \ncan be manipulated and subverted, national governments win. But now is the \ntime to further enable cities \u2013 not to curtail the power and reach they have mani -\nfested, but to improve on its coordination. First, national diplomatic institutions \nmust make room for cities, who are aggregating knowledge/intelligence daily that \nshould be of paramount interest to those charged with forecasting the future of \nnations and the international system. Foreign Ministries must treat urban issues \nnot as part of their development work, as is the case in many European ministries, \nbut as the seismographs their own cities are for changes in the economic, demo -\ngraphic, political and digital global landscape. If national governments want to \nmake rapid progress on combatting terrorism, creating food security, preventing \nand curtailing pandemic spread, and mitigating climate change, they will need \naccess to scalable, tested, data-grounded solutions, which exist in their own cities \namong their partners abroad. Foreign Ministries should consider the creation of \n\u2018urban desks\u2019 as part of their analytical or policy planning staff teams. The United \nStates has heeded that logic in creating an Office of Subnational Diplomacy at \nFoggy Bottom.\nSecond, given the crisis of democracy across the West, national governments \nshould use cities actively to engage citizenry around global issues. If the Biden \nadministration is serious about a \u2018foreign policy for the middle class\u2019, then surely \nthat must begin with engaging American mayors around international issues that \ndominate their decision-making \u2013 foreign investment and economic flows post-\nCOVID; resilient urban health systems and a mitigation of climate change effects. \nInaction on the local level can stymie national progress, coordinated action on the \nlocal level can supersede national ambitions, the lesson of \u2018America\u2019s Pledge\u2019, \nteaches us. The fact that the administration met nine times with the leading may -\nors\u2019 organisation over the first 100 days shows that Washington is well aware of \nurban power and influence \u2013 and wants to harness it for administration objectives \nto pursue a progressive, publicly supported policy agenda. Four years of the Trump \nadministration tested urban leadership in the United States on migration, climate \nand health. Cities\u2019 power to stand up to the federal level has not gone unremarked \nby President Biden. In the first of four phone calls with urban leaders from across \nthe United States since the confirmation of the vote, the President has assured \nhundreds of mayors they \u2018now have a friend in the White House\u2019, as he depends \non their support and advocacy to implement his COVID-19 recovery plan for the \ncountry\u2019s health system and its economy. Who really holds the key to power?\nThird, national governments working through multilateral institutions can work \nas correctives to balance the inequities between city networks by encouraging their \n\n148 Cathryn Cl\u00fcver Ashbrook\nexpansion to cities currently left out, for lack of economic or technological rea -\nsons. National governments could use their more expansive convening power to \nhelp create larger, city data banks like the city data used after the Second World \nWar to rebuild much of the world. This should be a part of the Marshall Plan-like \nthoughts developed for the future rebuilding of Ukraine. Different forms of aggre -\ngated, \u2018clean\u2019 data might allow financial institutions to better assess municipal debt \nin the developing world (Klaus, 2016) or increase investment accuracy in global \nhealth systems, where cities will always be nodes of research, health delivery and \noutcomes monitoring.\nConclusion\nMetrodiplomacy is not attempting to actively challenge nation-state sovereignty in \nthe international system, but to move \u2013 rapidly \u2013 ahead where national governments \nare constrained politically and ideologically. The rise of nationalism, populism and \ngreat power rivalry is a distraction to cities, who are putting out proverbial fires \nevery day, for whom the \u2018international\u2019 and \u2018national\u2019 can no longer be neatly sepa -\nrated, but whose institutions remain administrative institutions that are ill-prepared \nto tackle the plethora of challenges at the speed and scale at which they arrive at \nthe city line. As a practical alternative \u2013 not with duplicative intent \u2013 cities have \nformed issue-based diplomatic networks that are increasingly underwritten by data \nand reinforced by the ability of actors to use this data in the process of \u2018winning \nover\u2019 other actors in the hierarchy of international relations, where the monopoly of \npower of the nation-state (see Kello in this volume) is being renegotiated. Cities are \nvaluable because they offer an additional, potentially alternative web of diplomacy, \nthe elements of which (data gathering, foresight projections, trust in public action) \nwhich could be put in the service of national objectives \u2013 data-based, fact-based, \npractical and pragmatic in addressing global and local challenges. Or \u2013 as was the \ncase with the \u2018Visegrad Four\u2019 significantly challenge the nation-state\u2019s agency, as \nthe latter attempted to enforce anti-democratic structures \u2013 placing city and nation-\nstate in direct conflict, where cities rallied to lobby (through their agency) the next \nhighest ordering layer (the EU) to achieve its own objectives, grounded in the \nvalues (democracy) the nation-state was seemingly violating. How nation-states \nevaluate and interact with the emerging, networked agency of cities will determine \nthe role cities play in the shifting hierarchy of agents in the international system. \nThey could be of extreme value to nation-states going forward, if the state develops \ncapacities to engage with the intelligence urban networks are generating.\nIn the 21st century, these types of networks \u2013 though not all might prove durable \u2013  \nare emerging as an important second line of diplomacy that may have the capacity \nto tangibly change the world, because they can call on the trust-based authority \nthat dense cities and direct contact between citizens affords, where technology-\nbased disinformation threatens to atrophy social fabric and trust. Cities provide \nvital intelligence for the organisation of power such that democracy, pluralism and \n\nMetrodiplomacy  149\nequality can be preserved and strengthened in the international system. Nation-\nstate governments must recognise and amplify this power to assure their own, con -\ntinued progress.\nNotes\n 1 Adjusted for COVID effects.\n 2 Examples of urban innovation practice and ICT abound, that is, Cosgrave et  al.

Scholars have called for \ndetailed empirical analysis to examine how international actors are \u2018utilizing new \ncommunications technologies to their advantage and/or have been changed them -\nselves in the process\u2019 (Price, 2003). We know, for instance, that most NGOs use \nthe Internet and view social media as effective for advancing their cause.1 How -\never, we do not know if and how digital technologies are facilitating new kinds of \ntransnational advocacy networks. International Relations (IR) scholars have not \nyet examined if and how the nature of transnational advocacy is changing due to \ndatafication, the speed and pervasiveness of digital technologies. This is a major \noversight for IR given the growth of digitally based advocacy and the Internet\u2019s \npurported impact on issues as diverse as anti-globalisation, and the Arab uprisings \n(Gerbaudo, 2012; Juris, 2005).2\nThis chapter takes up this challenge by examining a group of new digital advo -\ncacy organisations, such as MoveOn, Campact, GetUp and 38 Degrees (Chad -\nwick  & Dennis, 2016; Karpf, 2012; Vromen, 2017).3 These organisations launch \ncampaigns through email, online petitions, Twitter, Facebook and viral videos. \nThey complement online actions with offline marches, demonstrations and vigils \nto push for change (Chadwick  & Dennis, 2016; Hall, 2019a, 2019b). Importantly \nall these organisations take advantage of datafication, speed and the pervasiveness \nof the internet in their campaigns. First, they use digital analytics to identify which \nissues are most likely to garner member-support (Karpf, 2016). They conduct A/B \ntests on their emails to figure out the most effective messaging and framing for \ntheir campaigns. Second, they are rapid response campaigners. Thanks to digital 6\nSTICKING TO THE STATE? \nTRANSNATIONAL ADVOCACY \nNETWORKS IN THE DIGITAL ERA\nNina Hall\n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  155\ntechnologies they can quickly, and cheaply, set up new campaigns and mobilise \ntheir members. Third, they have large lists of followers, from whom they crowdfi -\nnance their budgets, due to the pervasiveness of the internet.\nDigital advocacy organisations have been active for over a decade. MoveOn \nin the United States, for instance, has been campaigning actively since 1998 and \nhas over 12  million members. Campact was founded in 2003 in Germany and has \nover one million members. Meanwhile, 38 Degrees in the UK has over two million \nmembers and GetUp! in Australia has over one million members. Digital advo -\ncacy organisations have rapidly accrued large membership bases because they have \nredefined what it means to become a member of an advocacy organisation. Mem -\nbers of these organisations do not need to pay dues or regularly attend meetings but \nrather simply sign up to receive an email and/or regularly support an online cam -\npaign. Digital technology has enabled the emergence of this new form of advocacy \norganisation (Hall, 2022; Karpf, 2012).\nImportantly, digital advocacy organisations have paid, professional staff. They \nare permanent and formal organisations, not \u2018leaderless\u2019 horizontal movements.4 \nHence, they are distinct from important but sporadic social movements such as \n#Indignados in Spain, #OccupyWallStreet in the United States, or the global \n#metoo movement (Gerbaudo, 2012; Tufekci, 2017). They operate at international, \nregional, national and even the local level. MoveOn in the United States pioneered \nthis new model of member-driven, rapid response, digital campaigning in 1998 \n(Karpf, 2012). Subsequently, activists around the world have emulated this model \nfrom Israel (Zazim) to South Africa (Amandla), New Zealand (ActionStation) to \nSweden (Skiftet) (Hall, 2019a; Karpf, 2013). There are now more than 20 organisa -\ntions worldwide which emulate MoveOn\u2019s model of advocacy.\nThese digital advocacy organisations are also recognised as influential actors by \nthe media, the public and politicians. The Australian Financial Review Magazine \nnamed GetUp as one of the top ten actors with \u2018covert power\u2019 in Australia in 2016.5 \nIn Germany, Campact successfully mobilised public opinion against the Transat -\nlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) (Bauer, 2016). MoveOn was one of \nthe \u2018leading advocacy organizations\u2019 mobilising people against the Iraq War in the \nUnited States (Busby, 2010, p.  19; Heaney  & Rojas, 2007) and also in the resist -\nance against Trump (Fisher, 2019).\nYet most IR advocacy scholars have missed the emergence of digital advocacy \norganisations (Jurkovich, 2020; Medie, 2020; Price, 2003). Political communica -\ntions scholars have studied these organisations in their national contexts but have \nnot examined the transnational connections between them (Dennis, 2019; Karpf, \n2012; Vromen, 2017). This chapter, written from an IR perspective, focuses on \nthe transnational dimensions of digital advocacy. It investigates when, how and \nwhy these digital advocacy organisations collaborate transnationally. In doing so, \nit contributes to our understanding of whether, and how, new digital actors are \ntransforming patterns of collective action. It finds that the digital era has enabled \nnew forms of advocacy organisation, and it has not changed the locus of power. \n\n156 Nina Hall\nThe nation-state remains the most important target for digital advocacy organisa -\ntions\u2019 actions.\nDigital advocacy organisations represent an easy case for transnational advo -\ncacy, precisely because they all share the same mode  of digital advocacy. They can \nquickly and at low cost share tactics, strategies and messaging (e.g. emails, online \npetitions, Twitter storms, Facebook videos).6 In addition, the staff working in these \norganisations share progressive values and common cosmopolitan concerns: they \nwant action on climate change and refugees rights; and greater international col -\nlaboration to address pandemics. Although all the organisations in this study are \nnationally based organisations, they have created a strong transnational network: \nthe On-line Progressive Engagement Network (OPEN). Through this network, \ndigital activists meet regularly in person and have built up an extremely high level \nof trust, which I  observed over five years of studying them. They share tactics, \ntechnology and funding (Hall, 2022). In sum, we might expect digital advocacy \norganisations to frequently run transnational campaigns, given they have: common \nvalues  and organisational form , a strong institutionalised network  of activists, and \nuse digital  technologies to campaign.\nSo, do these organisations frequently campaign transnationally? I  answer this \nquestion through a combination of deductive and inductive theorising. Surpris -\ningly, I  find that, despite operating in a globalised and digital era, digital advocacy \norganisations generally target the nation-state and do not work with international \npartners. Although they frequently campaign on international issues, they neither \ntarget international actors nor work frequently with international allies. Digital \nactivists see the nation-state as the most important political actor. Digital IR scholars \nshould not assume that advocacy in the digital era will all become transnational, or \nlead to the formation of a \u2018global civil society\u2019 (Warkentin, 2001). Rather scholars \nshould study how advocacy is \u2018trasncalar\u2019 and operates across multiple scales \u2013  \nincluding cities, nations, regions and at the international level (Pallas  & Blood -\ngood, 2022) (see also Ashbrook, Chapter  5, for a discussion of the role of cities \nin digital diplomacy and how they are not directly challenging the nation-state). \nThis chapter challenges the assumption that a new generation of digital advocacy \norganisations will rapidly and easily organise transnational campaigns. However, \nthis finding is not generalisable across all advocacy organisations or social move -\nment organisations (Smith, 2022). We may see different patterns of transnational \ncollaboration in traditional advocacy organisations established before the digital \nera. NGOs which frequently run transnational campaigns with international part -\nners and international targets may well continue to do so. For instance, Greenpeace \nmay continue to target the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (UNFCCC); or Oxfam may continue to target the World Bank and the \nWorld Economic Forum to reduce poverty and inequality worldwide. Many tradi -\ntional NGOs gain power from their expertise over an issue and use insider lobby -\ning tactics to exercise influence. In contrast, digital advocacy organisations have \nexpertise in digital campaigning and digital analytics and derive power from their \n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  157\nability to rapidly mobilise their members (Hall, 2022). They are the digital \u2018nerds\u2019 \nwithin the advocacy sector (see Giacomello and Eriksson\u2019s Chapter on Rise of \nthe Nerd).\nThis chapter is structured into five parts. In the first section, I  outline how the \ndigital era has led to the emergence of new digital actors who have the potential to \ndisrupt international relations. In the second section, I  examine whether we might \nexpect the digital era to transform transnational  advocacy. In the third section, \nI explain my research methods and analyse how four digital advocacy organisa -\ntions campaigned during the early phase of COVID. Fourthly, I  explain why we \nrarely see digital advocacy organisations targeting international actors, and instead, \nthey target the nation-state. I  conclude with reflections on the importance of study -\ning transnational advocacy networks in the digital era.\nNew Advocacy Actors in the Digital Era\nPolitical scientists have examined how the digital era is transforming political \nactivity and advocacy. The internet has empowered new non-state actors, such as \nAnonymous, who exercise power because of their ability to code, hack and harness \ndigital technologies. These new actors have \u2018disruptive power\u2019 which is \u2018formless, \nunstable and collaborative\u2019 (Owen, 2015). Scholars have also illustrated how indi -\nviduals can more efficiently, cheaply and quickly scale up collective action through \ndistributed networks connected by weak ties (Fung, Russon Gilman,  & Shkabatur, \n2013; Shirky, 2008).\nSome scholars have suggested that the internet has heralded transformative \nchanges as people can connect without formal organisations, rapidly, and at low cost \n(Shirky, 2008). They have identified new forms of \u2018connective action\u2019, whereby \nindividuals use digital platforms to build personalised, rather than collective, action \nframes (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2013). We have seen the growth of digitally ena -\nbled social movements, which come together at particular critical junctures but are \nnot necessarily institutionalised or permanent organisations. #OccupyWallStreet, \n#BlackLivesMatter, and #FridaysforFuture have all galvanised thousands, if not \nmillions, of people both online and offline.7\nSome scholars have noted that traditional political organisations still play an \nimportant role in collective action, even in the digital era (Bimber, Flanagin,  & \nStohl, 2012; Han, 2014; Karpf, 2012, 2016). Although digital platforms can facili -\ntate the formation of new social movements, formal political organisations are crit -\nical for sustaining advocacy efforts and developing more effective tactics. This is \nbecause political organisations have hierarchies and institutional structures which \nstore information and enable learning (Tufekci, 2017). In fact, large, hierarchical \norganisations are often more effective at using digital tools than loosely networked \ngroups (Schradie, 2019). Hierarchical organisations typically exhibit a division of \nlabour that permits staff specialisation in digital communications and the formula -\ntion of a unified strategy (Bond  & Exley, 2016). In contrast, individual volunteers \n\n158 Nina Hall\nin grassroots groups or horizontal networks may not have the time, skills, or tech \nsupport to develop advanced digital communication skills.\nThis chapter does not make claims about the impact of digital advocacy tac-\ntics. This is because it is not useful to separate online and offline actions. In the \npast, this debate has been oversimplified. Some have argued that digital activism is \nsimply \u2018slacktivism\u2019 which encourages low-level commitment, and unthreatening \nactions that are unlikely to result in any transformative political change (Gladwell, \n2010). Others have been more optimistic about its impact and suggested that small \nindividual actions such as tweets and Facebook likes can scale up rapidly and lead \nto political change (Margetts, John, Hale,  & Yasseri, 2015). Yet this debate over \n\u2018slacktivism\u2019 misses the point: after all, most advocacy is neither purely online nor \noffline (Han, 2014). Most political actors use social media and digital communica -\ntions, alongside traditional face-to-face methods, to mobilise people offline and \nonline.\nTable  6.1 provides examples of new political actors which have emerged in \nthe digital era on the right and left of the political spectrum.8 Their use of digital \ntechnologies distinguishes them from traditional (pre-Internet) social movement \norganisations and advocacy organisations.\nDigital advocacy organisations are part of a much broader trend of digitalisa -\ntion of advocacy and political engagement. In this chapter, I  focus on progressive \ndigital advocacy organisations groups which are by now well-established, perma -\nnent organisations, with large memberships. These organisations have often been \nat the forefront of digital advocacy in their respective countries (Dennis  & Hall, \n2020; Karpf, 2012; Vromen, 2017). However, they are not representative of the \ntotal population of actors engaging in online activism. It would be hard to identify \nsuch a representative sample, given most NGOs and advocacy organisations use \nTABLE 6.1  Examples of New Political Actors in the Digital Era9\nType of Political Actor Right/Conservative Political Left/Progressive\nOrientation Political Orientation\nDigitally Enabled Social #AmericaFirst #Metoo\nMovements #Alllivesmatter #Blacklivesmatter\n#FridaysforFuture\n#Kony2012\n#Occupy Wall Street\nArab Spring\nDigital Advocacy Organisa -Right March (US) MoveOn (US)\ntions & Interest Groups The Vanguard.org (US) Avaaz (international)\nFreedom Watch (US) SumOfUs (international)\nAdvance Australia (Australia) Campact (Germany)\nCitizenGo (international) GetUp!

I  do not include right-wing digital advocacy organisations in \nthis study, but encourage readers to consult the emergent scholarship on groups \nsuch as CitizenGo (Ayoub  & Stoeckl, Forthcoming).10\nDigital advocacy organisations are distinct from traditional NGOs, in the lat -\nter have professional staff select issues to campaign on based on their expertise \nand commitment to a particular issue (Hall, 2019a, 2019b).11 In contrast, digital \nadvocacy organisations work across many issues simultaneously, starting and stop -\nping campaigns according to their members\u2019 interests and preferences. Unlike \nmost NGOs, they neither have expertise on a particular issue (e.g. human rights, \nthe environment or development) nor do they campaign on a sustained, long-term \nbasis. They can rapidly start and switch campaigns thanks to the low costs involved \nin sending an email, launching a petition or posting on social media (Hall  & Ire -\nland, 2016). They regularly engage in \u2018analytic activism\u2019, listening to and survey -\ning their members to identify which issues to campaign on, and how (Karpf, 2016).\nHowever, digital advocacy organisations are influencing the practices of other \nNGOs. Greenpeace, a traditional NGO, for instance, has adopted digital campaign -\ning tactics and in some chapters giving power to members can start their own \ne-petitions (Silberman, 2017). In turn, scholars have started to examine why some \nNGOs are more effective in digital campaigning than others (Hall, Schmitz,  & \nDedmon, 2020). Furthermore, some scholars have argued that these new digital \nadvocacy organisations are replacing traditional NGOs and enabling new forms of \ntransnational solidarity (Bush  & Hadden, 2019). Bush and Hadden, for instance, \nclaim that\nthe growth in internet-enabled campaign groups like Change.org, MoveOn, or \nAvaaz may mark the emergence of a new organizational model in which activ -\nists move easily across the virtual and physical, national and international, and \nsectoral boundaries that often demarcated the identities of traditional INGOs.\n(Bush  & Hadden, 2019, p.  1145)\nThe Transnational Dimensions of Digital Advocacy\nA rich and sophisticated literature has explored the ways that national protest can \nbecome internationalised and the dynamic relationship between national and inter -\nnationally targeted collective action (Sikkink, 2005; Tarrow, 2005; Tarrow  & della \nPorta, 2005; Tarrow  & McAdam, 2005).12 In the 1990s, many scholars suggested \nwe would see the emergence of a global civil society united by common values, \nnorms and professional practices. Globalisation and new communication tech -\nnologies would facilitate the formation of transnational advocacy networks united \naround common causes and values. Keck and Sikkink, for example, writing in \n1998, highlighted the global spread of communications technology (namely fax, \nradio, telephone and email), which would enable activists to communicate, share \n\n160 Nina Hall\ninformation and campaign more easily (Keck  & Sikkink, 1998). Since then, major \ndevelopments in technology (including wireless internet, smartphones and social \nmedia) have meant many of us are constantly online. Given the low cost and rela -\ntive ease of communication across borders, we could expect to enable more trans -\nnational advocacy. Some IR scholars have even argued that the internet would lead \nto a new global civil society (Germain  & Kenny, 1998; Gordenker  & Weiss, 1995). \nIn his prize-winning book, Warkentin argues that \u2018the internet facilitates global \ncivil society\u2019 (Warkentin, 2001, p.  33).13\nIn Warkentin\u2019s view, the fact that people could communicate much more \nquickly and for less cost using the internet meant they would \u2018establish and main -\ntain [transnational] social relationships that are the basis of global civil society\u2019 \n(p. 33). Scholte (1999) suggested that much \u2018civic activism has become global \nthrough the internet\u2019 (Scholte, 1999, p.  16). This has led to new forms of global \nidentity as \u2018many transborder civic activists regard themselves as world citizens \nin addition to (or even more than) national-state citizens\u2019 (Scholte, 1999, p.  16). \nMore recently, the sociologist Manuel Castells has argued that \u2018Movements spread \nby contagion in a world networked by wireless internet and marked by fast, viral \ndiffusion of images and ideas\u2019 (Castells, 2012, p.  12). However, IR scholars have \nnot closely examined and tested these claims (Keck  & Sikkink, 1998, p. 33).14 Does \nthe internet really facilitate transnational advocacy, or a global civil society? And \nif so, how and in what ways?\nI tackle these questions by looking at three dimensions of transnational \n advocacy, which are often elided in IR scholarship. First, activists can target \ninternational institutions such as the World Bank, or the World Trade Organi -\nzation. Second, they may operate within a transnational advocacy network and \ncoordinate with NGOs and norm entrepreneurs in other countries. Third, they may \ncampaign on a transnational issue, such as climate change, trade policy, war, or \nrefugee rights. Often, these three dimensions go hand in hand. The campaigns to \nachieve an international ban on land mines were driven by a transnational network \nthat targeted international negotiations on an issue which touched many countries \n(Price, 1998).\nBut this is not always the case. Activists can work on an international issue \nbut target a domestic actor, and work within a national advocacy network. Activ -\nists generally have greater power and leverage over their own domestic institu -\ntions, particularly in democratic states (Sikkink, 2005). It is possible that they will \nconcentrate their attention first on changing their own states\u2019 domestic policies or \nlegislation on a transnational issue before turning to the international level. Indeed, \nliberal IR scholars have long emphasised the role of domestic (interest) groups \nin shaping states\u2019 foreign policy before international negotiations (Milner, 1991; \nMoravcsik, 1997; Putnam, 1988; Risse-Kappen, 1995).\nIR scholars need to tease out the implications of the digital era for each of these \nthree dimensions of transnational advocacy, following the lead of social move -\nment scholarship (Rucht, 1999).15 In particular, they should examine whether \n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  161\ndigital technologies: (a) enable the formation of more (and stronger) transnational \nadvocacy networks; (b) encourage advocacy organisations to target international \ninstitutions more frequently; and (c) lead advocacy organisations to campaign on \ntransnational issues. This is important because scholars often assume the inter -\nnet will transform political engagement, but have not examined the precise causal \nmechanisms involved (Farrell, 2012).16\nDigital Campaigning During COVID\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 dramatically changed \nmost peoples\u2019 lives around the globe. Between March and May  2020, many gov -\nernments declared nation-wide lockdowns, closed borders and restricted people to \nworking from home.17 Digital advocacy organisations were well-placed to adapt \nto this new environment, given the online nature of their work and the fact that \nstaff were used to working remotely and on Zoom. In addition, these organisations \nwere able to quickly switch the focus of their campaigns and initiate campaigns \nthat addressed the unfolding COVID-19 crisis. This is consistent with the internal \nstructure of these transnational advocacy organisations. Staff are constantly scan -\nning the news, and analysing what their members and the public deem the most \nsalient issue of the day (Hall, 2019a).\nResearch Methods\nI employ qualitative case study research methods and a quantitative study of \ncampaign actions. I  focus on four of the largest digital advocacy organisations: \nMoveOn (USA), Campact (Germany), 38 Degrees (UK) and GetUp! (Australia). \nI worked with a research assistant to collect data on all their campaigns over a \nthree-month period (1 March  2020 \u2013 1 June  2020).18 This period was of particu -\nlar interest since it marked the first stage of the COVID-19 pandemic when most \ncountries went into lockdown and protest activities could only be conducted online \nin most countries (although this of course changed in the US summer with the \nlarge Black Lives Matters protests around the world, as well as the anti-COVID-19 \nregulation rallies). This period allows us to focus in on the strengths \u2013 and weak -\nnesses \u2013 of digital advocacy networks, given the extremely restricted opportunities \nto network in person.\nWe used the Facebook pages of each organisation to collate and code all of the \ncampaign actions undertaken by these four organisations during this three-month \nperiod.19 We focused on Facebook as it is the most popular social media site for \nall these organisations, although they also use Twitter, and increasingly Instagram. \nAny campaign posted there would also be posted on Twitter, Instagram and the \norganisations\u2019 own websites. We did not include posts which were re-postings  \nof: news items (e.g. a Guardian article about climate change or refugees) or \nother NGOs campaigns (e.g. there were many reposts of #Friday for Futures in \n\n162 Nina Hall\n2018/2019). We included all the different types of campaign actions (e.g. reports, \nonline petitions, demonstrations). For each campaign, we listed: the estimated date \nof the post, the date it was last publicised, where it was posted, the name of the \ncampaign, the URL page, the issue, the target of the campaign and the issue being \npursued by the campaign.\nWe collected a total of 153 campaign actions which were posted on Facebook \nbetween 1 March  2020 and 30 June 2020. Each campaign action was coded accord -\ning to whether it was: (1) COVID-related (yes/no); (2) the target  was international  \n(e.g. an international organisation, an international business, or an international pol -\nitician); (3) the campaign was conducted in collaboration with other international \nNGOs; and (4) whether the issue  was transnational.20 Identifying whether a campaign \nhad a transnational target or partnered with an international NGO was straightfor -\nward, however, identifying whether campaigns focused on transitional issues was \nmore difficult. We coded any campaign as \u2018transnational\u2019 when it was targeting a \ntransnational issue if it addressed a global public good (e.g. climate change) or an \nissue which traverses international borders (e.g. international trade), even if the cam -\npaigners only targeted national decision-makers.21 Importantly, we coded all cam -\npaigns relating to COVID-19 as transnational, on the basis that some specific issues \nmight be framed as national in nature (such as economic recovery post-COVID or the \nsalaries of healthcare workers), but they are related to a transnational phenomenon \nCOVID-19. In addition to collecting data on campaign actions, I  also conducted inter -\nviews with OPEN staff in 2020 and 2021.22 The sample is relatively small and hence \ncannot be generalised for all digital advocacy organisations, let alone other advocacy \nactors. However, this analysis offers insights into if and how digitally native organisa -\ntions campaign transnationally, and replicates the findings of a larger study of digital \nadvocacy organisations (Hall, 2022).\nRapid-Response Digital Advocacy\nIn March  2020, digital advocacy organisations rapidly launched COVID-19 cam -\npaigns. On 5 March  2020, the UK-based 38 Degrees initiated an online petition \ndemanding that then Prime Minister Boris Johnson introduce \u2018new emergency \nmeasures\u2019 so that anyone who needed to could self-isolate without losing income or \nemployment.23 On Friday 13 March  2020, Campact launched a campaign encour -\naging Germans to sign up and commit to stay at home and \u2018flatten the curve\u2019, given \nthe alarming news of the pandemic in Italy.24 Campact subsequently ran an online \ncalling for healthcare workers to be paid more.25 In the United States, MoveOn \nlaunched an online petition demanding that President Trump and Mike Pence pro -\nvide healthcare workers with protective equipment, which gathered over 163,000 \nsignatures.26 In Australia, meanwhile, GetUp! launched a #viralkindness campaign \nand offered tips for how to connect with other people in their community, and \nprovided links to \u2018community care postcards\u2019 and how to set up a \u2018community \n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  163\ncare group\u2019.27 These early COVID-19 campaigns targeted national governments \nand members\u2019 behaviours: encouraging them to stay at home, to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019, \nor help out their neighbours.\nAll four organisations rapidly switched their focus on the COVID-19 crisis \nbetween mid-March and early-June as Figure  6.1 demonstrates. In the weeks pre -\nceding the COVID-19 crisis, these organisations had been campaigning on a wide \nrange of issues not related to health: in the United Kingdom, 38 Degrees had been \ncampaigning to improve the compensations scheme for Windrush survivors; Cam -\npact petitioned the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy to \n\u2018save windpower\u2019; and GetUp! in Australia called for the Government to expand \nand extend funding to the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA).28 Digi -\ntal advocacy organisations can quickly respond to sudden crises, precisely because \nthey use the internet to campaign. There are low costs of starting up a new on-line \npetition and contacting thousands of members. They can test out new causes and \nmessaging using digital analytics to predict which issues will be most successful \nwith their members (on the use of Big Data for prediction, see also Aradau, Chap -\nter Nine). Datafication, speed and pervasiveness have enabled this new model of \nadvocacy organisation to emerge.\nFigure  6.1 is an aggregate of 38 Degrees, MoveOn, GetUp! and Campact cam -\npaign actions between 1 March  2020 and 1 June 2020. It illust rates how all four \norganisations focused increasingly on COVID from late February onwards. Over \nthe course of March and April, their COVID campaigns outnumbered campaigns \non all other issue areas. Notably, this shifted again in early June  2020 during the \nBlack Lives Matter protests and other issues were more numerous than COVID \ncampaign actions.\nFIGURE 6.1   Proportion of digita l advocacy organisations\u2019 campaigns relating to \nCOVID (1 January \u2013 1 June  2020).\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\n164  Nina Hall\nTransnational Issue\nIf we categorise COVID-19 as a \u2018transnational\u2019 issue, we see that a majority of \ntheir campaigns had a transnational dimension. There are good reasons for coding \nCOVID-19 as transnational: it is a global pandemic, which spread rapidly during \n2020, and had massive health, economic and societal implications for the entire \nworld. International institutions including the World Health Organization, the \nWorld Bank and the World Trade Organization have all been involved in coordi -\nnating states\u2019 response and trying to find collective solutions to ensure all countries \nreceive sufficient health and financial support to cope with COVID\u2019s impacts.29 \nHowever, we should note that digital advocacy organisations focused almost exclu -\nsively on the domestic aspects of COVID-19 (e.g. support and solidarity for health -\ncare workers,) as we will see in the following section.30\nDuring this same period, GetUp, Campact and 38 Degrees ran campaigns on \ntransnational issues which were not COVID related. Campact, for example, asked \ntheir members to: \u2018Boycott Bolsanaro\u2019 the Brazilian President; to buy buttons to \ndemonstrate solidarity with the Black Lives Matter protests, and urge the Ger -\nman Interior Minister to accept 1,000 children from Greek island refugee camps.31 \nGetUp! urged its members to sign a #BlackLivesMatter global statement of soli -\ndarity.32 38 Degrees demanded the British Secretary of State, Liz Truss, and Prime \nFIGURE 6.2   Overall proportion of campaigns that were COVID-19 related  (1 March \u2013  \n1 June  2020).\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  165\nMinister Boris Johnson not to sign \u2018bad trade deals, that threaten our food  & animal \nwelfare standards and NHS\u2019 (National Health Service).33\nFigure  6.3 illustrates some variation across the network, with 38 Degrees report -\ning the most campaign actions on a transnational issue (42), and MoveOn the least \n(18). Campaign actions which related to a non-COVID-related transnational issue \namount to 38.5% of Campact\u2019s campaigns; 15.7% of GetUp!\u2019s; and 8.3% of 38 \nDegrees\u2019; and zero percent of MoveOn. In this chapter, I  do not seek to explain \nvariation in issue selection although I  do elsewhere (Hall, 2019a).\nInternational Targets\nCampaign actions, whether online petitions or offline demonstrations, target an \ninstitution or decision-maker. In Figure  6.4, we see that digital advocacy organisa -\ntions almost never targeted an international actor. Rather, these organisations mobi -\nlised national members to apply pressure on their respective national governments. \nWe identified only one case of an international target: GetUp!\u2019s #BLM solidarity \nstatement called on \u2018elected leaders around the globe to end the war against Black \npeople\u2019.34 In short, digital advocacy organisations\u2019 almost always targeted national \ndecision-makers, even if they focused on transnational issues.\nFIGURE 6.3   Digital advocacy organisations\u2019 campaigns that dealt with a transnational \nissue  (1 March \u2013 1 June  2020).\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\n166 Nina Hall\nInternational Allies\nDigital advocacy organisations may choose to work alone or team up with other \nNGOs and civil society organisations. The choice of ally will depend on the nature \nof the campaign and the issue at hand. Although all the organisations in this study \nare nationally based, we might expect them to frequently campaign with other digi -\ntal advocacy organisations, given the strength of the OPEN network. Yet this was \nnot the case: the organisations did not name any other OPEN organisations as part -\nners (see Figure  6.5). Beyond the digital sphere, digital advocacy organisations did \ncollaborate to crowdsource an advertisement in the New York Times in support of \nthe BLM protests on 16 June  2020. However , this action was outside of our data \ncollection timeframe, hence not included in the figures in this chapter .\nAt the same time, frequent exchanges did occur within the OPEN network dur -\ning the first phase of COVID. One OPEN staffer reported to me that Executive \nDirectors across the network were talking more regularly during the first months of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic than they ever had before. These conversations enabled \ngroups to share ideas and lessons about how to campaign during COVID across \ncountries. OPEN hired a \u2018network technology support advisor\u2019 specifically to help \nOPEN groups develop and coordinate COVID-related campaigns.35 OPEN groups \nwere active domestically and shared their tactics, strategies and actions transna -\ntionally, but did not work on a collective, transnational campaign to challenge the \nglobal response to COVID-19 during the first phase of the pandemic.\nFIGURE 6.4   Number of digital advocacy organisations\u2019 campaigns with an interna -\ntional target (1 March \u2013 1 June  2020).\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  167\nExplaining the Lack of Transnational Advocacy\nIR scholars have long predicted that the digital era would enable more frequent \ntransnational advocacy. After all, the costs of communication have declined, mak -\ning it easier for activists to forge bonds across borders, develop common cam -\npaigns and mobilise people online. Digital advocacy organisations should be an \neasy case for transnational advocacy, given these organisations predominantly use \nemail, and social media to campaign, and hence can quickly share campaign con -\ntent. Moreover, the world faced a common external crisis in 2020, COVID, which \ndramatically re-shaped the lives of people all around the world.\nWhy then did the OPEN network not enable transnational campaigns on COVID \nduring this time of global crisis? One reason is that digital advocacy organisations \nhave a particular theory of change, ingrained in their organisational model. They \nsee the state as the most important locus of power state in international politics \n(Hall, 2022). One activist from the OPEN network explained that: \u2018there is no \nstrong reliable actors that we can target [at the international level], international \ninstitutions they usually perceive as toothless\u2019.36 Another digital activist explained \nthat targeting international bodies is not a \u2018strong theory of change\u2019 because citi -\nzens have little leverage over decision-makers in these institutions.37 Another staff  \nmember explained that other, traditional NGOs are better placed to engage in \ninsider advocacy at the international level. As they stated: \u2018The people who trawl \nthe halls of international institutions are people who use different kind of tactics, \nthey\u2019re writing lobby papers, it can be very academic, it\u2019s very much influence \nFIGURE 6.5  Number of campaigns with an international partner.\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\n168 Nina Hall\nfrom the inside\u2019.38 Traditional NGOs, such as Oxfam or Human Rights Watch, \nhave a very different theory of change. They hire expert staff who then choose \nand run campaigns, and members fund these campaigns. In contrast, digital advo -\ncacy organisations almost exclusively use outsider tactics, or what they call \u2018people \npower\u2019. Rather than focusing on international institutions (such as the UN, WHO, \nWorld Bank, or G7), or working with international NGOs, they mobilised citizens \nto put pressure on their respective governments\u2019 positions.\nPrecisely because their power comes from mobilising citizens nationally  to put \npressure on domestic  decision-makers. They rarely engage in transnational col -\nlaborations or focus on international targets even though staff in these organisations \nactivists have cosmopolitan views: they believe in solidarity with BLM; assistance \nfor refugees, and in assisting those worst affected by climate change and COVID-\n19. Rather digital advocacy organisations look for targets that are much closer \u2018vis -\nible to our members\u2019. This is because when a \u2018target or an issue is very far-removed \nfrom a domestic, urgent issue, it\u2019s very hard to make a case\u2019 that their members \nshould get involved in the campaign.39\nIn sum, their organisational form  influenced their choice of national over \ninternational targets. Precisely because  they are member-driven, and because \ntheir members come from national constituencies, they framed their campaigns \nin national terms. Digital advocacy organisations need to choose campaigns, and \ntactics, which their members will get behind. This often means choosing cam -\npaigns which directly affect them. This explains why they rarely campaigned on \nimportant international issues during this period which had no direct link to their \nmembers (e.g. protests in Hong Kong which were ongoing, and discussions about \ndebt forgiveness for the Global South). Political opportunity structures and access \nto international institutions are only part of the explanation. Digital networks do \nenable advocacy organisations to share information, tactics and messages but do \nnot automatically lead to a coordinated transnational campaign, even in the pres -\nence of high-trust network. Overall, this study suggests that whether an advocacy \norganisation is member-driven or staff-driven tells us more about if and how they \nwill campaign, than whether they use digital platforms or not.\nConclusion\nWe live in an increasingly globalised world where issues spill over borders, beyond \nthe oversight of national governments. The digital advocacy organisations I  exam -\nined in this chapter have formed dense international networks and regularly to \nshare tactics, messaging and strategies. There is a high degree of trust within the \nOPEN network, and they all share progressive values. Most notably, they all follow \nthe same digitally enabled mode of advocacy. Given these similarities, we might \nexpect them to frequently campaign transnationally.\nInstead, digital advocacy organisations rarely partnered with each other, or with \nother international NGOs. While they campaign frequently on transnational issues \n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  169\nsuch as COVID-19, they did so through a national lens, mobilising their members \nto put pressure on their national decision-makers. In the face of a massive global \npandemic with international ramifications \u2013 closure of international borders and \ncontroversy over the role of the World Health Organization \u2013 these digital advo -\ncacy organisations stuck to the state. We did not see the emergence of a new digi -\ntally connected global civil society, or even more frequent instances of digitally \nenhanced, transnationally  coordinated campaigns (Scholte, 1999; Wapner, 1995).\nMore research is needed to unpack patterns of transnational advocacy in the \ndigital era. It would be useful to expand this study to other digital advocacy organi -\nsations such as Avaaz, WeMove and SumOfUs as well as traditional NGOs, such as \nOxfam, Amnesty International or Greenpeace. We might find that the latter adopted \ndigital tactics, but that there is no overall increase in the frequency of transna -\ntional advocacy. Further research should also examine the limits of this new digital \nadvocacy organisation \u2013 why are there so few organisations in the global south? \nAnd why are there no organisations operating in authoritarian regimes? In sum, IR \nscholars should not assume that digital technology \u2013 and in particular speed, perva -\nsiveness and datafication \u2013 will transform all dimensions of transnational advocacy \nas the nation-state remains a central target for advocacy.\nNotes\n 1 A survey of 4,908 NGOs from around the world found that 92% have a website; 71% \nregularly send email updates to donors and supporters; and 72% of NGOs use Twitter, \n55% YouTube, 39% Instagram and 16% WhatsApp. Eighty-eight percent of NGOs sur -\nveyed view social media as effective for creating social change. Although, the survey \ndoes not investigate if or how social media is effective (Nonprofit Tech for Good, 2017)\n 2 There is, however, a large literat ure of political communication scholarship on this topic; \nsee for example Dennis and Hall (2020); Karpf (2012); Tufekci (2017).\n 3 Political scientists have also studied the emergence of digital political parties (Gerbaudo, \n2018). These parties feed off member-engagement, like the big tech companies, and \nhave lowered the cost of entry by making membership free. Rather than organising their \nmembers in traditional party structures with physical headquarters and regular in-person \nmeetings, they engage their members online.\n 4 Scholars have demonstrated that organisations with bureaucracy and clearly divisions of \nlabour are more effective at digital outreach and engagement than horizontal, networks \nor movements (Schradie, 2019).\n 5 They defined covert power as \u2018indirect power that allows them to effect change and \ninfluence the overtly powerful. The overtly powerful was a list of people who derived \npower from their positions or standing \u2013 and was a list of the most senior politicians in \nAustralia with the Prime Minister at number one (Australian Associated Press, 2017).\n 6 IR scholars often treat transnational advocacy networks as the primary unit of analysis, \nrather than the organisations that comprise these networks (Busby, 2010; Keck  & Sik -\nkink, 1998). They also focus on how transnational advocacy networks form around a \ncommon issue  (women\u2019s rights, human rights, deforestation, debt relief, the International \nCriminal Court, HIV-AIDS, or climate change), not around a common mode  of advocacy.\n 7 Note that both Black Lives Matter and FridaysforFuture now have organisational struc -\ntures. However, they both opt for distributed campaigns, in which local chapters have a \nhigh degree of autonomy to determine their campaigns (Chotiner, 2020).\n\n170 Nina Hall\n 8 It is more accurate to refer to the digital eras in plural, rather than as a singular digital era \ngiven how different the internet of 2020 is from the internet of 1990 (Karpf, 2020).\n 9 This is not an exhaustive or representative list of new political actors and includes \nmostly Western-based organisations.\n 10 Although there have been attempts to replicate the MoveOn model by political actors on \nthe right, they have not been successful (Karpf, 2016 for possible explanations).\n 11 Some digital advocacy organisations do focus on specific issues: 350.org which focuses \non climate change, and All Out which focuses on gay rights.\n 12 Alongside the IR scholarship, social movement scholars have identified various ways in \nwhich national (or local) advocacy and social movements may: diffuse ideas and practices \ninternationally; shift scale and externalise their campaigns to an international organisa -\ntion; or engage in \u2018transnational collective action\u2019, defined as \u2018coordinated international \ncampaigns on the part of networks of activists against international actors, other states or \ninternational institutions\u2019 (della Porta  & Tarrow , 2005, p.  3). Tarrow and McAdam empha -\nsise that international protest doesn\u2019t just emerge from \u2018global consciousness or economic \nintegration\u2019 (Tarrow  & McAdam, 2005, p.  145) but must be built up through coalitions. \nFurthermore, a domestic movement that shifts in scale to the international level is not auto -\nmatically a transnational or a global movement (Tarrow  & McAdam, 2005, p.  146). Nota -\nbly, this work has focused more on social movements  rather than advocacy organisations .\n 13 The book was the first winner of the ISA Chadwick Alger prize, which recognises the \nbest scholarship in ISA\u2019s International Organization Section.\n 14 Keck and Sikkink argued in 1998 that \u2018we lack convincing studies of the sustained and \nspecific processes though which individuals and organizations create (or resist the crea -\ntion of  ) something resembling a global civil society\u2019. I  would argue this is still the case \nwith regards to transnational advocacy in the digital era.\n 15 Rucht (1999), a social movement scholar, suggests that the transnational aspect of a move -\nment may refer to four different dimensions: issues, targets, mobilisation and organisation.\n 16 Farrell (2012) argues that future research will not be \u2018internet\u2019 researchers as the internet  \nwill be so integrated into political processes that we cannot disentangle the online from the \noffline.\n 17 There was variation in how strict these lockdowns were, how long they lasted and how \neffective they were. Furthermore, restrictions and lockdowns were reimposed in many \ncountries later in 2020 and 2021. For more on government\u2019s responses to COVID, see \nOxford Blavatnik School of Government (2021).\n 18 Thanks to Charlie Lawrie who produced all the charts for this chapter and provided \ninsightful feedback.\n 19 Separately, collecting campaign data from organisational websites also posed methodo -\nlogical challenges, since websites change rapidly, past campaigns may no longer be \nlisted and organisations rarely if ever archive their campaign activities.\n 20 One important caveat: data recorded for MoveOn only extends to 19 June and any cam -\npaigns posted between 19 June and 30 June are missing from the dataset. This is because \nthe final data recording resumed in October  2020, at which point accessing data on the \nMoveOn Facebook page became technically challenging.\n 21 Some issues are clearly local (e.g., increasing state support for a local library; or fund -\ning for victims of sexual violence) and some were clearly international (e.g., campaigns \nagainst international trade agreements). There were a large number of campaigns which \ntargeted a transnational issue (e.g., climate change) but were framed in national terms \n(e.g., stopping the Adani coal mine in Australia). Many of the campaigns coded as tar -\ngeting a \u2018transnational\u2019 issue also included a reference to the transnational dimensions in \nthe campaign material (i.e., report, petition or demonstration announcement). However, \nit was not imperative for the campaign material to mention a transnational dimension to \nbe mentioned to be included in this category.\n\nTransnational Advocacy Networks in the Digital Era  171\n 22 This is part of a broader book project \u2018Transnational Advocacy in the Digital Era: Think -\ning Global, Acting Local\u2019 (Hall, 2022) which draws on over 100 interviews with digital-\nactivists in the OPEN network between August  2015 and March  2021.\n 23 38 Degrees, https://speakout.38degrees.org.uk/campaigns/7199  (accessed 15 October \n2020)\n 24 Campact, \u2018Coronal Kollaps\u2019  https://blog.campact.de/2020/03/corona-kollaps-verhin -\ndern/  (accessed 15 October  2020).\n 25 Campact, \u2018Klinik Personal\u2019, https://aktion.campact.de/klinikpersonal/appell/teilnehmen  \n(accessed 15 October  2020)\n 26 MoveOn, \u2018Health care workers need protective equipment now\u2019 https://sign.moveon.\norg/petitions/healthcare-workers-need-protective-equipment-now?source=mo.social  \n(accessed 15 October  2020)\n 27 GetUp!, \u2018Viral Kindness\u2019, https://viralkindness.org.au/  (accessed 15 October  2020)\n 28 GetUp! \u2018Stand up for Renewable Ener gy\u2019, https://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/climate-  \njustice/stand-up-for-renewable-energy-16092bd0-9468-4ca2-b5aa-710207afdf7a/\nstand-up-for-renewable-energy  (accessed 15 October  2020).\n 29 During the first phase of the pandemic, there were massive shortages of personal protec -\ntive equipment for healthcare workers, as well as ventilators and other medical supplies \nneeded to help those most severely hit by COVID. There were also calls for a global \n\u2018debt\u2019 jubilee for all developing countries who could not finance the costs of COVID \nalongside servicing their regular debt. Avaaz, for example, ran a campaign on with the \nJubilee Debt Campaign. Avaaz, \u2018Coronavirus debt relief\u2019, https://secure.avaaz.org/cam  \npaign/en/coronavirus_debt_relief_loc/  (accessed 15 October  2020).\n 30 Interestingly, even when they did campaign on international institutions and dimensions \nof COVID-19 they did so by targeting national governments.

The letter starts by stating: \n\u2018We believe that Google should not be in the business of war\u2019 (Menegus, 2018). \nThrough the letter and its public circulation, the Google employees staged a protest \nagainst Google\u2019s involvement in the US Department of Defense Project Maven, \nwhich promised to use AI to identify objects in video streams from aerial drones \nand thus support drone targeting. While there are many definitions of AI, the con -\ntemporary resurgence of interest and research on AI can be understood as com -\nprising \u2018a constellation of technologies, including machine learning, perception, \nreasoning, and natural language processing\u2019 (Crawford  & Whittaker, 2016, p.  2). \nThe letter argued against the \u2018weaponization of AI\u2019 and asked Google to with -\ndraw from Project Maven. Its initial version received wide coverage and was fol -\nlowed by a supporting letter endorsed by over 700 researchers and published in The \nGuardian . Led by three Science and Technology Studies academics, Lucy Such -\nman, Lilly Irani and Peter Asaro, the letter highlights the dangers of AI technolo -\ngies, which \u2018are poised to automate the process of identifying targets, including \npeople and directing weapons to attack them\u2019 (Suchman et  al., 2018). Much of this \ndebate focused on the question of using AI for security and warfare, of militarising \nor weaponising AI.\nIn international relations (IR), novel digital technologies have raised questions \nabout norms and ethics, human and non-human agency, global governance and \nlegal regulation (e.g. Bode  & Huelss, 2018; Hoijtink  & Leese, 2019). As Corneliu \nBjola and Markus Kornprobst outline in the Introduction to this volume, digital 7\nALGORITHMIC SECURITY AND \nCONFLICT IN A DATAFIED WORLD\nClaudia Aradau\n\n178 Claudia Aradau\ninternational relations refer to the \u2018 interplay of digital technologies and power \nstructures in global politi cs\u2019, which transform human and non-human agency, and \nordering processes. Concepts of technology, power, agency and order are highly \ncontested, and they gain different meanings depending on the theoretical prism \nthrough which they are approached.\nThis chapter proposes a micropolitical  and sociotechnical  lens for the analysis \nof how digital technologies transform practices of conflict and security. A  micropo -\nlitical perspective entails attention to the mundane aspects of already existing digi -\ntal technologies, the technologies that are embedded in the everyday lives of people \nand institutions, in order to trace the effects of digital disruption for international \ninteractions, practices and institutions. It is thus distanced from work that casts \ntechnology as spectacular, exceptional, macropolitical and deterministic. A  socio -\npolitical perspective understands technology as emergent through power relations \nrather than pre-given and either subordinated to powerful humans and institutions \nor enabling power over humans and institutions. The lenses proposed here are not \njust theoretical, inspired by ongoing conversations between IR and Science and \nTechnology Studies (STS) (see Bellanova et  al., 2021; Bousquet, 2018; Hoijtink  & \nLeese, 2019), but are also reflected in security practices. As the Head of the US \nJoint Artificial Intelligence Center has commented, \u2018[i]t is not a vision for killer \nrobots deciding who lives and doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s more like Waze, but for war\u2019 (Groll, \n2019). Waze is a navigation application, which can provide drivers with real-time \ntraffic update, fastest route and other navigation information. It is similar to many \nof the apps that can be accessed through smartphone interfaces. Waze was acquired \nby Google in 2013.\nThe metaphor of \u2018Waze for war\u2019 captures the various elements of micropolitical \nand sociotechnical transformations: banal technologies, entanglements of public-\nprivate actors and the imbrication of security with everyday life. What happens \nwhen the same technologies we use to monitor traffic, consume news or access \nour phones are deployed for the purposes of war? In the introduction to their \u2018AI \nNext\u2019 program the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) also \nhighlights this more mundane character of digital security technologies: \u2018Rather, \nthe machines DARPA envisions will function more as colleagues than as tools. \nTowards this end, DARPA research and development in human-machine sym -\nbiosis sets a goal to partner with machines\u2019 (DARPA, 2020). Similarly, The US \nDepartment of Defense has highlighted the role of AI as augmenting rather than \nreplacing humans:\nAI will be used with the objective of reducing the time spent on highly man -\nual, repetitive, and frequent tasks. By enabling humans to supervise automated \ntasks, AI has the potential to reduce the number and costs of mistakes, increase \nthroughput and agility, and promote the allocation of DoD resources to higher-\nvalue activities and emerging mission priorities.\n(Department of Defense, 2019, p.  11)\n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  179\nRather than killer robots and automated lethal weapons, which wrest agency \nand power from humans, Groll, DARPA and the Department of Defense (DoD) \nspeak about augmented technologies and mundane Waze-like apps. Yet, it is the \ndiscourse of technology as taking control and of non-human agency as effacing \nhumans that have attracted most public attention. The reason for the discrepancy \nbetween these discourses might be, partly, the obscure and abstract language of \ndigital technologies; and, partly, it might be the public and cultural imaginaries of \nintelligent machines taking over.\nThe terminologies associated with the internet and digital technologies are multi -\nple and varied: Big Data, algorithms, machine learning, automated decision-making, \ndeep learning, AI and many more. These varied terms indicate novel and often opaque \ntechnologies. We use apps on our phones to read newspapers, check social media \naccounts, track our route on a map or find a restaurant nearby. The interfaces through \nwhich we access them tell us little about the algorithms, data flows and infrastructures \nthat underpin the selection and targeting of information. Moreover, these mundane \ndevices at first sight seem to have little to do with international relations, security and \nconflict. Yet, they share techniques of data extraction, algorithmic processing and pre -\ndiction with many security practices. In a datafied world, security actors rely on infra -\nstructures developed by the big tech companies, while computer scientists become \nsecurity experts and data flows transform relations between public and private actors.\nWhat kinds of security practices emerge through the algorithmic processing of \nlarge swathes of data or what has come to be known as \u2018big data\u2019? What are the \nimplications of developing a \u2018Waze for war\u2019? I  explore three transformations that \nthese technologies entail for security and conflict, which can be analysed along \nthree analytical dimensions: knowledge (prediction), othering (anomaly) and \npower (targeting). First, algorithms intensify the \u2018predictive technoscience\u2019 of \nsecurity (Suchman, Follis,  & Weber, 2017). Big Data and algorithms promise new \npowers of prediction to not just \u2018connect the dots\u2019, but also find the \u2018needle in a \nhaystack\u2019. This knowledge of prediction now supplements logics of prevention and \npre-emption analysed by IR scholars. Second, algorithmic security is increasingly \nnot directly about enemies, but about anomalies (Aradau  & Blanke, 2018, 2022). \nI explain how machine learning algorithms \u2018hunt\u2019 for anomalies in masses of data. \nThird, I  argue that imaginaries of conflict and security need to be understood within \na broader transformation towards \u2018targeted societies\u2019 (Chamayou, 2015). While \ntargeting has been a key aspect of military practice, \u2018targeted societies\u2019 draw their \npractical and imaginary resources from both computer science and marketing. In \nconclusion, I  outline several implications that these transformations have for the \nstudy of digital international relations as data relations.\nDigital/Data/Algorithms\nGiven the novelty of the various terms used to describe digital technologies, a \nfew terminological clarifications are in order. The term \u2018digital\u2019 has led to many \n\n180 Claudia Aradau\ndisciplinary reframings such as \u2018digital humanities\u2019, \u2018digital sociology\u2019, \u2018digital \ngeography\u2019, \u2018digital STS [science and technology studies]\u2019, \u2018digital anthropology\u2019 \nand so on. The digital has become an overarching concept, which encompasses and \nrenders a wide range of technological transformations. For many disciplines that \nhave adopted the moniker of the digital, it has largely superseded that of \u2018virtual\u2019 \nand \u2018cyber\u2019, even as cyber continues to be used in widely circulated terms such as \ncybersecurity or cybercrime. As sociologist Richard Rogers has pointed out, the \ndigital has superseded the problematic distinction \u2018virtual/real\u2019 in Internet research \n(Rogers, 2013). IR scholars have cautioned against the use of \u2018the digital\u2019 as indica -\ntive of epochal change and propose to approach it as \u2018a  vantage  point to speak \nabout its various affordances and the situated relationship it entertains with politics\u2019 \n(Kaufmann  & Jeandesboz, 2017, p.  310).\nViktor Mayer-Sch\u00f6nberger and Kenneth Cukier have formulated the concept \nof datafication as \u2018taking all aspects of life and turning them into data\u2019 (Mayer-  \nSch\u00f6nberger  & Cukier, 2013). Datafication means that digital objects and traces can \nbe processed computationally. For instance, scanning a book does not mean that the \nbook can be read by a computer. It can be digitised, but it is not necessarily search -\nable. Additional processing is required for the book to become datafied. Or in an \nexample closer to security issues, the use of CCTV cameras is an example of digiti -\nsation, while facial recognition entails the supplementary datafication of images so \nthat they can be processed computationally instead of having a human watch long \nhours of CCTV recordings. Datafication is often used in conjunction with Big Data, \nwhich stands for the massive volumes of data produced about all aspects of our \nlives, which comes in a variety of forms, from books and images to social media \ndata and location data on our mobile phones, and with increased velocity, given the \nubiquity of sensors and mobile devices that generate data at speed.\nAn algorithm is \u2018a procedure or set of steps or rules to accomplish a task\u2019 \n(Schutt  & O\u2019Neil, 2013). In this formulation, algorithms \u2013 like data \u2013 have a long \nhistory. However, what distinguishes algorithms today is their combination with \nBig Data and machine learning. According to data scientists Rachel Schutt and \nCathy O\u2019Neill (2013), machine learning algorithms are the basis of AI and are used \nfor the purposes of prediction rather than modelling. Given that algorithms process \ndata, they have become a shorthand for the concentration of power and fears about \ntechnology, particularly given the performance and imagined efficiency of machine \nlearning algorithms such as neural networks. Algorithms are more generally opera -\ntions that transform an input into an output, while also being specific operations \non data. Sociologist Tarleton Gillespie has argued that we can think of \u2018computers, \nthen, fundamentally as  algorithm  machines \u2013 designed to store and read data, apply \nmathematical procedures to it in a controlled fashion, and offer new information as \nthe output\u2019 (Gillespie, 2014, p.  167).\nIn this chapter, I  use algorithms to refer not to \u2018autonomous technical objects\u2019, \nbut to \u2018complex sociotechnical systems\u2019 (Seaver, 2018, p.  378). As complex socio -\ntechnical systems, algorithms are entangled with data, knowledge, people, devices \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  181\nand infrastructures. This relational understanding of algorithms allows us to trace \nthe dispersed and everyday transformations of security and conflict. Algorithms do \nnot work without data, which needs to be extracted, cleaned, and stored in order \nto be rendered computationally processable. These processes require infrastruc -\ntures of extraction and circulation, as well as particular forms of knowledge and \nnetworks of experts. They are also dependent on subjects whose data is extracted, \neither knowingly or unknowingly, either consensually or by stealth. A  relational \nunderstanding of algorithms avoids the language of \u2018autonomy\u2019 used now in \ninternational law and IR in relation to \u2018lethal autonomous weapon systems\u2019 and \nAI. Technologies are rarely autonomous, even when algorithmic decisions might \nappear to elude human understanding. Rather, as Matthias Leese and Marijn Hoi -\njtink (2019, p.  2) remind us, \u2018most technologies are, in fact, rather working with \nhumans than in the place of humans. They assist, pre-structure, point out and make \nsuggestions\u2019.\nAs these vocabularies become stabilised as they circulate in public debates, it \nis important to attend to the assumptions that undergird the vocabularies that we \ndeploy in our analyses. While at times data is privileged over algorithms and vice \nversa, digital over cyber, AI over machine learning, autonomy appears to be the \nleast adequate term to describe these new technologies, as it assumes a separation \nof humans and machines. As this chapter argues, digital international relations are \nabout heterogenous and asymmetric human-data-algorithmic relations.\nAnticipatory Security: Prevention, Pre-emption, Prediction\nBig data and machine learning algorithms have amplified the promise of anticipa -\ntory security to detect unknown dangers and intervene before these dangers could \nmaterialise. Scholarship in IR has shown that security governance has become \nincreasingly anticipatory and has traced the transformations of probabilistic and \npossibilistic knowledge in the governance of risks and uncertainties. Whether it \nis through urgency and the immediacy of threat or anticipation of catastrophes \nto come, security professionals and their practices have been turned towards the \nfuture. This anticipatory orientation has been translated through the languages of \nrisk or uncertainty, and the associated practices of prevention, pre-emption, prepar -\nedness or resilience (e.g. Amoore, 2014; Anderson, 2010; Aradau  & van Munster, \n2011; Kessler  & Werner, 2008; Leander, 2011; O\u2019Malley, 2010). While there are \nmany distinctions between how these practices entwine risk and uncertainty, prob -\nability and conjecture, their temporal aspect has been paramount.\nThe concept of risk has shifted the analytical focus from securitising utter -\nances about imminent threats and exceptional measures to the technologies and \nstrategies by means of which the future is produced as calculable. An unknown \nfuture is \u2018tamed\u2019 through statistical knowledge and preventive interventions. Did -\nier Bigo has analysed how risk emerges in the practices of \u2018managers of unease\u2019 \u2013 \nthe police, intelligence services, military or private security agencies \u2013 who used \n\n182 Claudia Aradau\nthe \u2018authority of statistics\u2019 to classify and prioritise risks (Bigo, 2004). When the \npolice make use of insurance knowledge, statistics and profiling for the purposes \nof prevention, security takes on the language and rationale of risk. For instance, \nFrontex, the EU border agency publishes quarterly Risk Analysis Reports based \non numbers of migrant nationalities, so that different risk profiles and trends \nemerge. More recently, scholars have highlighted how Frontex\u2019s risk analysis \nreports are \u2018gendering and racializing migrants, their motivations, behavior, and \nchoices and assign differential value, rights, and agency on the basis of perceived \ndichotomies between masculinity/femininity, (non)/European, (non-)white, \nrational/irrational, civilized/chaotic, active/passive\u2019 (Stachowitsch  & Sachseder, \n2019, p.  119).\nMoving beyond risk, other literatures have shown that radical uncertainty has \nfractured the statistical and probabilistic approach to risk, giving rise to different \ntechniques and modes of knowledge (Samimian-Darash  & Rabinow, 2015). Faced \nwith the possibility of the \u2018next terrorist attack\u2019, the model of preventive calcula -\ntion reaches its limit. Although security professionals, intelligence agencies and \nthe insurance industry continue to develop models to calculate or estimate the risk \nof a terrorist attack, they also recognise that today\u2019s challenge comes from what \nformer United States Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, infamously referred \nto as \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 \u2013 things we do not know we do not know. In the face of \ncatastrophes to come, the technologies and rationalities of governance have been \nchanging as they \u2018favour instead the rendering of pre-emptive decisions that do \nnot calculate probability based on past evidence, but rather on the horizon of what \nmay happen in the future\u2019 (Amoore, 2008, p.  850). Scenario planning, foresight \nand emergency exercises, psychological profiling or resilience training purport \nto render the contingency of the future governable. Louise Amoore has noted a \nshift from probability to possibility in security practices (2014), while others have \ntraced similarities between financial speculation and speculative security (Cooper, \n2008; de Goede, 2012), or new modes of reasoning that are \u2018conjectural\u2019 in their \nreliance on clues and insignificant details that might reveal something about the \nfuture (Aradau  & van Munster, 2011).\nFrom \u2018connecting the dots\u2019 and finding \u2018the needle in the haystack\u2019 to predic -\ntive policing and data mining for counterinsurgency, security professionals have \nincreasingly adopted the language and methods of computing for the purposes of \nprediction. In so doing, they have taken inspiration from other Big Data applica -\ntions in the corporate world and have deployed practices of working with Big Data. \nBig Data seems to invite practices of hyper-speculation by making infinite corre -\nlations and associations possible. danah boyd and Kate Crawford caution against \nthe possibilities of \u2018apophenia\u2019 in vast masses of data: \u2018seeing patterns where none \nactually exist, simply because massive quantities of data can offer connections that \nradiate in all directions\u2019 (boyd  & Crawford, 2012, p. 668). Computer scientists \nand practitioners concur in emphasising the predictive logics of Big Data more \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  183\ngenerally, not just for the purposes of security: \u2018Prediction  is the hallmark of Big \nData\u2019 (Ekbia et  al., 2015, p.  7).\nAs in everyday language prediction captures an orientation towards the future \nand its control, there has been less attention to how machine learning and predictive \nanalytics in particular work differently from other future-oriented security technolo -\ngies. Predictive analytics as the \u2018process of discovering interesting and meaningful \npatterns in data\u2019 (Abbott, 2014, p.  3) has been key to security professionals\u2019 dream \nof acceding to the future and interrupting the emergence of potential dangers before \nthey can become full-fledged and potentially catastrophic events. While predictive \nanalytics resonates with the practices of pre-emption as \u2018the attempt to project the \npast into a simulated future that can be acted upon in the present\u2019 (Andrejevic, \nDencik,  & Trer\u00e9, 2020, p.  1530), there are also subtle differences.\nPrediction has been perhaps most closely associated with new technologies of \npredictive policing, even as similar algorithmic methods for predictive analysis \nare used across many security-related fields. In the United States, where predic -\ntive analytics has been extensively deployed for the purposes of policing, there \nhave been many public and academic controversies over its discriminatory effects. \nWhile demographic categories have long been used for the purposes of policing, \npredictive policing now uses Big Data and algorithms to make decisions about who \nand where to police (Brayne, 2018). As sociologist Sarah Brayne explains, the use \nof historical crime data risks creating a \u2018self-fulfilling statistical prophecy in which \ncrime rates increasingly reflect enforcement practices\u2019 (Brayne, 2018, p.  297). At \nthe same time, algorithmic prediction is different from statistical methods used on\nlarge datasets of criminal offending rates in order to determine the different \nlevels of offending associated with a group or with one or more group traits and, \non the basis of those correlations, to predict the past, present, or future criminal \nbehaviour of a particular person and to administer a criminal justice outcome \nfor that individual.\n(Harcourt, 2008, p.  16)\nDemographic or other groups traits are key to statistical profiling and the preven -\ntive logic of risk management. Unlike statistics, machine learning algorithms for \nprediction work with large numbers of data points from a variety of digital devices \nand data sources.\nThe first challenge for predictive policing is to gather more and more data in \norder to find new patterns in this data. Moreover, predictive algorithms need not \nuse (only) demographic data. PredPol is one of the major predictive policing tech -\nnologies, which has been at the heart of intense public controversies over discrimi -\nnatory effects again black populations (Lum  & Isaac, 2016). In response to intense \npublic and academic controversy, PredPol purports to clarify that it \u2018does not col -\nlect, upload, analyse or in any way involve any information about individuals or \n\n184  Claudia Aradau\npopulations and their characteristics\u2019 (Rey, 2020). This does not mean that PredPol \ndoes not have discriminatory effects, given the way that algorithms for prediction \nwork, as we will see further down. Yet, PredPol, renamed as Geolitica in 2021, \ncontinues to emphasise its use of \u2018where\u2019 and \u2018when\u2019 rather than \u2018who\u2019 of crime \ndata to elude accusations of racial discrimination.\nOne of the founders of HunchLab, another major digital system using Big Data \nto forecast crime, rejects public representations of predictive policing as akin to \n\u2018Minority Report\u2019:\nThis was not Minority Report; we could not predict what people would do. But \nwe could use a combination of historical crime data and other data (time of year, \nday of the week, proximity to bars, lighting, weather, etc.) to generate a forecast \nof the locations where a crime is somewhat more likely to occur on a given day \nof the week or time of the day.\n(Cheetham, 2019)\nHunchLab uses a variety of data, not just historic crime data, which had been key \nfor risk profiling. Time, weather, lighting and so on become features that of a data \nobject \u2013 \u2018crime\u2019. By representing these different data points, HunchLab could use \nalgorithmically derived patterns out of the data, as presentation material for the \ncompany outlines: \u2018The system automatically learns what is important for each \ncrime type and provides recommendations of where to focus the resources that \nyou have available\u2019 (Azavea, 2015). While there are many differences between the \ntypes of software used, the amount and variety of data, and the types of algorithms, \nwhat is key here is the production of predictions. Unlike other companies produc -\ning predictive policing software, HunchLab has provided information about their \nprocesses through blogs, online papers and videos. The company explains why \nthey don\u2019t rely just on past crime data, but combine it with other types of data to \nproduce predictive models:\nOur belief is that the use of non-crime data sets as variables within a crime \nprediction system is important, because variables based solely upon crime data \nbecome skewed as predictions are used operationally. For instance, as crimes \nare prevented in mission areas due to police response, the only variables iden -\ntifying areas as high risk are skewed in other systems. By including other data \nsets, our system is more robust against this issue.\n(Azavea, 2015, p.  12)\nAs we have seen, recent technologies process Big Data with machine learning \nalgorithms. These algorithms plot data as points/dots in multi-dimensional spaces \ncalled \u2018feature spaces\u2019, where a feature is a measurable attribute that can be repre -\nsented as a dimension in this space. Each dot is defined by how much abstract space \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  185\nthere is in-between it and the other dots in the same space or how distant they are \nfrom each other (Blanke, 2018). Different geometrical measures and distances can \nbe used, so that any object can be represented as a data point through a combination \nof features (Provost  & Fawcett, 2013).\nTo predict, machine learning algorithms measure all the distances between all \nthe data \u2018dots\u2019 in this artificial space. Geometric distance is read in inverse rela -\ntion to how similar these dots are. Prediction is enacted through calculations of \nwhat Tobias Blanke and I  have previously called \u2018between-ness\u2019 or the calcula -\ntion of distances between anything mapped onto the geometry of the feature space \n(Aradau  & Blanke, 2017, 2022). These calculations of between-ness divide feature \nspaces between similar and dissimilar sub-spaces. These calculations of distance \nin a geometric space differentiate algorithmic prediction from pre-emptive logics \nin subtle ways. Anything that can be represented as data points in a feature space \nbecomes predictable.\nThe sub-spaces of dense or proximate points will then be translated onto a geo -\ngraphical map and become the target of police attention and intervention. However, \nthe translations between the feature space to the geographical space are not always \nintelligible and can be difficult to question. While the geographical map is the result \nof the feature space, how the feature space was partitioned and how the data points \nwere translated geographically remains obscure. Given the proprietary nature of \nthe software, these would also be unknown to the police officers themselves. Based \non field research with police forces in Germany and Switzerland, Simon Egbert and \nMatthias Leese (2021, p.  207) conclude that the use of predictive policing software \nis \u2018aggravating already problematic police practices with regard to the production \nof deviance and suspicion \u2013 while at the same time cloaking discrimination and \nprofiling in alleged rationalization and algorithmic opacity\u2019. Alongside the inser -\ntion of \u2018prediction\u2019 as a form of knowledge that can supplement prevention and \npre-emption, research on predictive policing indicates two further transformations \nof security practices, actors and institutions.\nFirst, security actors become Big Data actors, as their work needs to increas -\ningly incorporate the extraction and processing of Big Data, and it is shaped by \nthe demands of collecting and working with this data. While security actors have \nhistorically collected data as part of making populations legible and governable, \ndata storage and processing still raised many difficulties given physical limits to \nphysical or computational capabilities. With machine learning algorithms and Big \nData, there is in principle no limit to the number of features that can be used in \nan artificial space. Feature spaces can have hundreds, thousands or hundreds of \nthousands of features and dimensions, depending on how much computers can \nprocess. It is this feature space, which drives the (big) data needs in machine learn -\ning. Data scientist Dean Abbott (2014, p.  153) explains that, \u2018[a]s the number of \ninputs increases, the number of data points needed to fill the space comparably \nincreases exponentially\u2019, because the number of inputs corresponds to the number \n\n186 Claudia Aradau\nof features. The more features there are in an abstract information space, the more \nspace there is to fill in with data. Security institutions can thus be seen as Big \nData organisations, in the sense that their activities are increasingly shaped by the \nneed to collect, store and process data. Security practices have become Big Data \npractices. As NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden noted in his memoir Perma -\nnent Record,  digital technologies redefined what intelligence was: \u2018it was not about \nclandestine meetings or dead drops, but about data\u2019 (Snowden, 2019, Loc 62).\nSecond, the same machine learning algorithms that power apps, social media \npersonalisation and recommendation engines are used across social fields. The \ntypes of algorithms used by Netflix, Google, Waze or Facebook are also used by \nsecurity actors. On the one hand, this is due to the fact that, unlike data, algorithms \nare limited. On the other, machine learning requires expert skills, which security \nactors often acquire by sub-contracting work to tech companies. Given that the big \ntech companies have the infrastructures and computational power needed to run \nmachine learning algorithms on different types of data, security actors are increas -\ningly reliant on these companies and their infrastructures. In a datafied world, all \nsecurity practices tend to become commercial security practices. Even as these \neffects are unequally felt across the world, as security actors in the Global North \nhave access to data and resources to access infrastructures and expertise for its \nprocessing, Big Data and algorithmic security are increasingly used globally. As \nDaniel Edler Duarte (2021, p.  212) has shown in his analysis of the making of \nthe CrimeRadar app in Rio de Janeiro, \u2018however much favelas may be seen as the \nepitome of dangerous places in security imaginaries, they do not produce enough \ninputs to be identified by CrimeRadar\u2019s algorithms as high-risk areas\u2019. There -\nfore, decisions on which data counts, how to collect it, which features to select, \nand which algorithms to deploy are deeply entangled with political contexts of  \n(in)security and violence.\nThe predictive knowledge that machine-learning algorithms promise enables \nthe production of new self/other relations. Through prediction, distance becomes \nan indicator of risk and danger. It makes possible the drawing of lines between geo -\ngraphical zones and populations who inhabit these spaces. Prediction also enables \nthe selection and targeting of enemies, to which the next section turns.\nDatafying Dangerous Others: Distance and Density\nIn the introduction to a special issue on \u2018The faces of enmity in international rela -\ntions\u2019, Mathias Delori and Vron Ware distinguish the representation of the enemy \nin the military field from other social fields. They argue that \u2018military practices \ncan also produce original representations of the enemy, which then leak out of the \nmilitary sphere\u2019 (Delori  & Ware, 2019, p.  300). Delori and Ware contrast enemy \nfigures produced in the military sphere from other social and political representa -\ntions of enmity. In so doing, they echo the philosopher of science Peter Galison\u2019s \narticle on \u2018The ontology of the enemy\u2019, which placed the novelty of enemy figures \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  187\nnot within transformations in military practices, but scientific advances and their \nintersections with military thought and practice. Galison outlines the production of \ndifferent figures of enmity in different social fields:\nEnemies were not all alike. In the killing frenzy of World War II, one version \nof the Enemy Other (not Wiener\u2019s) was barely human; to the Americans, Brit -\nish, and Australians, the Japanese soldiers were often thought of as lice, ants, or \nvermin to be eradicated. These monstrous, racialized images of hate certainly \npresented one version of the World War II enemy, but it was by no means the \nonly one. Another and distinct Allied vision held the enemy to be not the racial -\nized version of a dreaded opponent but rather the more anonymous target of \nair raids. This enemy\u2019s humanity was compromised not by being subhuman, \nvicious, abnormal, or primitive but by occupying physical and moral distance. \nViewed from afar, from the icy heights of thirty thousand feet, a city in Germany \nlooked small, and individual people appeared to be invisible, partially shorn of \ntheir likeness to the bomber.\n(Galison, 1994, p.  230)\nIf a dehumanised enemy emerged in public representation and discourse, the mil -\nitary practice of air targeting produced another figure of the enemy, one which \nwas deprived of human characteristics through the massification that distance pro -\nduced. To these versions of the enemy, Galison opposes one version emerging at \nthe intersection of cybernetics, operations research and game theory. The cyber -\nnetic enemy (Wiener\u2019s this time) was similar to machines, its status blurred with \nthat of the machine. Neither subhuman nor objectified by physical distance, the \ncybernetic enemy seemed to efface the racialised hierarchies of humanity. It was \na \u2018cold-blooded, machinelike opponent\u2019 (Galison, 1994, p.  231). While these ver-\nsions of the enemy appear to exist in separate fields of practice, they inevitably \ncirculate and contaminate each other, as Delori and Ware highlight.\nHow do machine learning algorithms translate the feature space into versions \nof the enemy when deployed by military and security actors? Are algorithms \nreplicating the figure of the anonymous, monstrous or machinic enemy? The \nprevious section has outlined how the increasing use of data and machine learn -\ning algorithms recasts our lives as data points, which are more or less distant \nor more or less proximate, in an abstract geometric space. Predictive policing \nfocuses on partitioning the feature space depending on proximity and density of \ndata points, which are then translated according to criminological assumptions \nabout the spatio-temporal density and co-occurrence of crime. Police interven -\ntions can then be focused on certain areas of crime density. Yet, transformations \nof security have increasingly raised questions about \u2018unknown unknowns\u2019 or \nwhat has come to be formulated as the \u2018needle in the haystack\u2019 in the language of \nmany security practitioners (Aradau  & Blanke, 2018; Logan, 2017; Reichborn-\nKjennerud, 2022).\n\n188 Claudia Aradau\nIn 2010, DARPA issued a funding call for Anomaly Detection at Multiple \nScale, which was formulated as responding to the predictive questions raised by \nthe shooting at the Soldier Readiness Center at Fort Hood, Texas (DARPA, 2010). \nA year earlier, Army Major Nidal Hasan had opened fire at the Centre and killed \n13 soldiers and injured other 32. The question that funding applications needed to \naddress was one of prediction and its limits. How is it possible to know when an \ninsider \u2018turns\u2019 and becomes an outside/an enemy? The insider is thus not the out -\nsider inside, as representations of the \u2018internal enemy\u2019 have long suggested. Rather, \nan outlier is meant to capture the threshold between insider/outsider, the \u2018unknown \nunknowns\u2019 or the unknown \u2018needles\u2019. Outliers render the problem of becoming \ndangerous rather than being dangerous:\nEach time we see an incident like a soldier in good mental health becoming \nhomicidal or suicidal or an innocent insider becoming malicious we wonder \nwhy we didn\u2019t see it coming. When we look through the evidence after the fact, \nwe often find a trail \u2013 some-times even an \u2018obvious\u2019 one. The question is can \nwe pick up the trail before the fact giving us time to intervene and prevent an \nincident? Why is that so hard? Because we generally need to look through an \nenormous amount of data and don\u2019t know where to look or what to look for. \nIn particular, we generally don\u2019t have a good understanding of normal versus \nanomalous behaviors and how these manifest themselves in the data.\n(DARP A, 2010)\nRaytheon was one of the companies awarded funding under the DARPA call. \nTheir program SureView was meant to trail through masses of data in order to find \nsigns of anomalous behavior, from \u2018Web browsing, removable media, MS  Office \napplications, file activity, email, MS  Windows registry , peer-to-peer applications, \nlog on/log off activity, keystroke logging and clipboard functions, use of printers, \nuse of Windows terminal services, instant messaging, command line operations \nand use of encryption\u2019 (Raytheon, 2011). The focus on data came in response \nto problems highlighted by the investigations into the practices of the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI). The lack of connectivity, limited search capabili -\nties, lack of training and an explosion of data were some of the diagnoses of the \nFBI\u2019s failure.\nThe Webster Commission\u2019s report on Fort Hood recommended that\nthe FBI evaluate and, if appropriate, acquire and implement advanced and auto -\nmated search, filtering, retrieval, and management technologies to assist Agents, \nAnalysts, TFOs, and other personnel in reviewing and managing data .  . .. These \ntools are an important means by which the FBI can hope to master the ever-\nexpanding amount of electronic data in its possession.\n(William H. Webster Commission, 2012)\n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  189\nA Senate Report for the Committee on Homeland Security arrived at similar con -\nclusions concerning the processing and analysis of electronic communications. \nOne of their key diagnoses was that Major Hasan\u2019s various communications were \nnever linked and particularly they were not connected with his \u2018public displays of \nradicalization\u2019 (Lieberman, 2011, p.  51). This was due to inter-institutional strife, \nbut also to errors and glitches that exchanging and interpreting data entail: for \ninstance, DoD staff had misread the abbreviation \u2018comm. Officer\u2019 as communica -\ntions officer rather than commissioned officer and therefore misr ead the content of \nHasan\u2019s communications (Lieberman, 2011, p.  35).\nA decade ago, these recommendations were still far away from Raytheon\u2019s Big \nData dream. As Raytheon indicated, the mass of data is seen as hiding anomalies. \nWith machine learning algorithms, becoming dangerous can be deciphered in the \nmass of data by calculating anomalies through the analysis of distance and density. \nData points that are close or clustered together in the feature space are assumed to \nbe similar. Data points that are sparse or at a distance from most other data points \nare considered dissimilar \u2013 these can become outliers or anomalies. In a patent \nfor outlier detection in high-dimensional data spaces, computer scientists Charu \nAggarwal and Philip Shi-lung Yu note that outliers are \u2018an aside-product of clus -\ntering algorithms\u2019 (Aggarwal  & Yu, 2011). Outliers emerge at a distance from the \ndenser and sub-spaces of a feature space. A  data point becomes  an outlier if it is \n\u2018present in a local region of abnormally low density\u2019, where this low density cannot \nbe explained by randomness (Aggarwal  & Yu, 2011). Former Director of DARPA\u2019s \nInformation Innovation Office (I2O), John Launchbury (2017) used the concept \nof \u2018data manifolds\u2019 as a way of differentiating data clusters in a topological space. \nOutliers or anomalies have become particularly important for all security practices, \nfrom tracing fraud and abnormal financial transactions to anticipating criminality \nor terrorist activity (for a discussion, see Aradau  & Blanke, 2018).\nOutliers are neither individuals nor populations. The dangerous other as an out -\nlier or anomaly helps nuance arguments about the \u2018individualization of war\u2019, the \nshift from sovereign states and collective responsibility towards \u2018individual pro -\ntection, liability and accountability\u2019 (Welsh, 2019). As this section has shown, it \nis difficult to speak about an increased focus on the individual as such in security \npractices. Conflicts are not becoming individualised manhunts, even as manhunt -\ning can be a spectacular aspect of contemporary conflicts (Chamayou, 2012). The \ndangerous other emerges through clusters of data points that are at a distance from \nmore proximate data points in a defined space. In the topological space of data \nmanifolds, anything can become an outlier through often banal, but potentially \ninfinite combinations of data points.\nThe production of dangerous others as an anomalous data manifold is indicative \nof another transformation of security practices. The anomaly does not immediately \nappear as a racialised figure of the enemy. This does not mean that racialised con -\nstructions of a dehumanised or subhuman other disappear, but they emerge in more \n\n190 Claudia Aradau\nopaque and illegible ways. An outlier can be distinguished by a combination of \nmany features, none of which necessarily relies on group traits or even on proxies \nfor race. Yet, it is this combination that renders some into \u2018targetable, killable bod -\nies in drone assemblages\u2019 (Wilcox, 2017, p.  15) and it does so potentially indefinite. \nTargeting is the form that the power to kill takes in a datafied world. The next sec -\ntion explores the circulation of targeting between marketing and security practices.\nFrom Risk Societies to Targeted Societies\nBest known for his Theory of the Drone , philosopher Gr\u00e9goire Chamayou (2015) \nsuggested in a brief article that we now entering \u2018targeted societies\u2019. Building on \nChamayou\u2019s suggestion, this section argues that targeting as a form of power in \na datafied world has emerged through entanglements between the worlds of mar -\nketing, data science and security. In international relations, targeting is a military \npractice par excellence, but one which has been transformed sociotechnically and \ndigitally. As Antoine Bousquet has aptly put it, targeting is \u2018an emergent modal -\nity of military violence that is characterized not only by the planetary scale of its \noperations but also by a granularity that scales all the way down to the bodies of \nsingle individuals\u2019 (Bousquet, 2018, p.  3). Tar geting seems to have given rise to \nglobal manhunting, made possible through the fusion of intelligence and military \noperations (Reichborn-Kjennerud, 2022). Erik Reichborn-Kjennerud has analysed \ntargeting as a \u2018martial epistemology\u2019 through which \u2018everything and everyone, \neverywhere and all the time are not only potential targets  for action, but have \nalready been targeted  and are constantly retargeted  as new data and reconfigura -\ntions engender new relations that makes the world measurable, indexed, intelligible \nand actionable\u2019 (2022). Oliver Kessler and Wouter Werner (2008) have approached \ntargeting in the context of the \u2018war on terror\u2019 as techniques of risk management \naiming at an unpredictable and unknown enemy. As a result, \u2018[s]uspected terror -\nists are targeted, not because of their formal status as such, but rather because they \nare believed to be guilty of terrorist attacks in the past and believed to constitute a \nmortal threat in the future\u2019 (Kessler  & Werner, 2008, p.  305).\nTargeting is present in many different forms in our societies: from warfare to \nmarketing and elections. Chamayou speaks of \u2018targeted societies\u2019 exactly given the \ncommonalities of targeting among the military, policing and marketing (Chamayou, \n2015). He sees a shift away from individuals to be policed and statistical calcula -\ntions of risk profiles. In that sense, the algorithmic processing of data is indicative \nof a transformation from risk-governed societies to targeting-governed ones. \u2018Risk \nsociety\u2019 was formulated by sociologist Ulrich Beck to name the limits to insur -\nable risk, which could be calculated statistically in industrial societies, to risks that \nhave become unbounded and uncontrollable. According to Beck, such large-scale \nthreats can \u2018neither be adequately confirmed nor attributed, nor compensated, nor \n(preventively) managed in accordance with prevailing legal, scientific and political \nprinciples\u2019 (Beck, 2009, p.  30). As IR scholars have shown, such catastrophic risks \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  191\nare nonetheless the object of governing strategies and taming uncertainty, as we \nhave seen in the first section. Prevention and pre-emption have been supplemented \nby algorithmic prediction techniques that do not foretell the future; they project \neverything onto a data space so that everything can become related. The spatiali -\nsation of data points through calculations of distance and density makes possible \npredictions of similarity and dissimilarity, of regularity and irregularity.\nAs Big Data and associated algorithmic techniques circulate between differ -\nent social worlds, targeting as a form of power becomes reconfigured at the inter -\nsection of marketing and security. A  report by the National Security Commission \non Artificial Intelligence, which considered the role of artificial intelligence and \nmachine learning for US national security and defense, takes marketing knowledge \nas a blueprint of security knowledge and practice: \u2018Potential adversaries will rec -\nognize that every advertiser and social media company knows: AI is a powerful tar -\ngeting tool. Just as AI-powered analytics has transformed the relationship between \ncompanies and consumers, now they are transforming the relation between govern -\nments and individuals\u2019 (National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, \n2020, p.  11). Indeed, \u2018target the right people\u2019 has long been a motto of the mar -\nketing industry, which had adopted the metaphor of \u2018marketing as warfare\u2019 and \nworked through corporate bureaucracies \u2018structurally organized in a manner analo -\ngous to military units\u2019 (Rindfleisch, 1996, p.  6).\nMarketing has started to mobilise Big Data and machine learning algorithms \nfor the purposes of producing surplus value. A  textbook on predictive marketing, \naimed at explaining the advantages of predictive analytics techniques to manag -\ners, is eerily similar to policing and war techniques discussed in the previous sec -\ntions. The authors distinguish algorithmic methods of customer clustering from \nearlier techniques of segmentation. Like risk profiling, segmentation was the pro -\ncess of \u2018manually putting customers into groups based on similarities\u2019, while \nclustering is \u2018a method to automatically discover segments in your customer base \nby using already known factors about your customers\u2019 (Artun  & Levin, 2015, \np. 26). While segmentation used one or two factors, clustering can use many \ndata features, leading to a key distinction between segmentation and clustering: \n\u2018When you segment you know whom to target ahead of time; when you cluster \nyou discover whom to target\u2019 (Artun  & Levin, 2015, p.  26). We are not all tar -\ngeted equally and not everyone is targeted all the time, even as all the data makes \nsegmentation possible.\nCompanies would focus on different clusters of customers who share some sim -\nilarities: for instance, those who buy sportswear and sunglasses, as in one example \noffered by the authors of Predictive Marketing . New groups to be targeted do not \ndepend on shared epistemic assumptions about marketing such as targeting high-\nvalue customers or trying to extend one\u2019s customer basis by targeting new demo -\ngraphic categories. Targeting is about representing data in ways that reveal new \nand unexpected groups, which then require different forms of intervention. Target -\ning is enabled through personalisation or, more precisely, \u2018mass personalization\u2019 \n\n192 Claudia Aradau\nunderstood as \u2018algorithmic processes in which the precise adjustment of prediction \nto unique individuals involves the computation of massive datasets, compiling the \nbehaviors of very large populations\u2019 (Kotras, 2020, p.  2).\nBy attending to how marketing makes use of Big Data and predictive analysis \nto target consumers, we can understand how targeting as a form of power shapes \nsocieties and circulates across borders. Critical military and security studies have \nargued that military thinking and technology are diffused into other spheres of \nsocial, economic and political life. At the same time, machine learning and market -\ning techniques are infusing practices of security and conflict in ways that are both \nmundane and often invisible, shaped by computational knowledge and marketing \npractices. As machine learning expertise circulates across social worlds, through \nthe mediation of tech companies and start-ups, these entanglements need to be \ntraced in practice. Thus, it is thus not surprising that the Chair of the National Secu -\nrity Commission on Artificial Intelligence was Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO \nand subsequently technical adviser at Alphabet Inc. until 2020.\nFollowing the controversy surrounding Project Maven, with which this chapter \nhas started, more recent disclosures have shown that Google used gig economy \nworkers in countries of the Global South to label images gathered from drone sur -\nveillance (Fang, 2019). The so-called data labellers needed to distinguish between \ndifferent elements in an image to create training data upon which algorithms could \nthen be tested and models developed. In order for algorithms to find new patterns, \nthey need to be first \u2018trained\u2019 on a set of data. For instance, a video stream would \ncontain a range of elements \u2013 human and non-human \u2013 that would need to be \nlabelled by a human in order to produce a dataset for training algorithms. Rather \nthan autonomous or automated, machine learning algorithms rely on extensive \ninvisible labour both in the Global South and in de-industrialised regions of the \nGlobal North (Casilli, 2019).\nIf targeting has become a planetary practice, as IR scholars have shown, it has \nbeen animated by the demands for more and more data to continually produce \nnew relations of personalisation that cut across individuals and populations. Per -\nsonalisation is not about individuals, but about the granularity of clusters made \npossible by the mass of data and machine learning algorithms. Clusters, Engin Isin \nand Evelyn Ruppert (2020) have suggested, are \u2018intermediary objects of govern -\nment between bodies and populations that a new form of power enacts and governs \nthrough sensory assemblage\u2019. This also means that all security practices, like mar -\nketing practices, are first and foremost data practices that enable personalisation \nfor targeting.\nConclusion\nThis chapter has outlined some of the transformations of security and conflict in \na datafied world. Not only are more and more aspects of our lives transformed \ninto digital data, but this data can be increasingly processed in quasi real-time to \n\nAlgorithmic Security and Conflict in a Datafied World  193\ndisclose patterns, associations and anomalies. By taking \u2018algorithms\u2019 as a short -\nhand for complex sociotechnical systems that encompass data, knowledge, people, \ndevices and infrastructures, I  have attended to how algorithmic security does not \nemerge through the separation of humans and computers, but through mundane \npractices that have entangled datafication, machine learning algorithms and secu -\nrity. While military and computer technologies have been long interconnected, here \nI have focused on transformations of knowledge (prediction), othering (anomaly) \nand power (targeting).\nStarting from an analysis of predictive policing, the chapter has shown that \nanticipatory security now relies on machine learning algorithms which establish \nsimilarities through a calculation of distances between data points. Unlike pre -\nvention and pre-emption, which have been articulated in relation to future events, \nprediction is spatial, working through representations of data points in an abstract \n\u2018feature space\u2019. The second transformation concerns the figure of the enemy which \nis now the result of a similar set of predictive calculations. Rather than produced \nthrough dichotomies of self/other, identity/difference, the dangerous other is an \nanomaly or an outlier, anything that is set at a distance from other data points in an \nabstract geometrical space. Third, if targeting has been seen as specific to military \npractices, Big Data and predictive analytics have transformed it through market -\ning techniques of personalisation. Unlike risk societies, where insurable and cata -\nstrophic risks required the classification of populations into risk groups through \nprofiling, targeting through personalisation produced a massified individual, a clus -\nter that is neither individual nor population. These transformations challenge the \nbinaries through which agency and order are approached in international relations: \nprivate versus public, state versus markets, mass versus individual, self versus \nother, inside versus outside. These are not oppositional concepts and processes but \nare entanglements that can only be analysed in practice, through materialisations, \nfailures, controversies and glitches.\nMany of the terms introduced in this chapter have not been commonly employed \nin IR. While Big Data and AI have started to be used in analyses of security and \nconflict, IR scholars need to engage with the concepts and methods developed in \ncomputer and data science, as these intersect with other vocabularies and practices, \nfor instance in marketing. Digital IR, like other social science disciplines, can only \naddress the specificities of the digital through interdisciplinary inquiry. In a data -\nfied world, international relations are also data relations. Starting with these rela -\ntions rather than the pregiven categories of the discipline \u2013 state/non-state, private/\npublic, domestic/international \u2013 alerts us to the changing contours of a digital and \ndatafied world (cf. Kello in this volume).\nFinally, digital international relations need to revisit the unevenness of the \ninternational and racialising hierarchies that digital technologies intensify, repro -\nduce or amplify. On the one hand, data incorporates racisms that are both repro -\nduced and rendered invisible in the masses of data and the separation of data \nmanifolds. On the other, international relations as data relations depend upon \n\n194 Claudia Aradau\nmany invisible forms of labour and workers who are dispersed around the world. \nDigital IR entails the study of both complex sociotechnical systems and the data \nwork that sustains them.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by funding from the European Research Council (ERC) \nunder the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program \n(SECURITY FLOWS, Grant Agreement No. 819213).

To do so, it will \napply Susan Strange\u2019s (1994 ) quintessential IPE \u2018structural power\u2019 framework \ndeveloped in States and Markets . The main strength of this approach is its versa -\ntility and capacity to capture both economic and political, and material and idea -\ntional, phenomena in a way that produces a comprehensive understanding of power \nin interstate, and non-state actor, relations in the global economy. The focus will \nbe on the distribution of power between the United States, China and the European \nUnion, as the three main locus of influence in world affairs.\nFor Strange the most important question in IPE was (and is) \u2018cui bono\u2019, who \nbenefits and who pays? And who gets new opportunities? She would take the \nanalysis beyond the narrow exercise of coercion product of state agency (which \nwould fall under the rubric of relational power), and rather concern herself with the \narrangements and bargains between different actors regarding the allocation of dif -\nferent benefits, costs, rights, risks and opportunities, understood in a broad sense. \nHer attention to how these arrangements came to be leads to a broader under -\nstanding of power, as the ability to shape frameworks of interaction and ranges of \nchoices for the actors in the world economy. Thus, in her own words, \u2018structural \npower\u2019 can be defined as \u2018the power to shape and determine the structures of the \nglobal political economy within which other states, their political institutions, their \neconomic enterprises and (not least) their scientists and other professional people \nhave to operate\u2019 ( Strange, 1994 , pp. 24\u201325).\nThus, Strange\u2019s broad conceptual framework covers both the hard and soft power \ndistinction established by Joseph Nye (2009 ), but also the more comprehensive 8\nTHE INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL \nECONOMY OF THE DIGITAL \n(REVOLUTION)\nMiguel Otero-Iglesias\n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  199\nthree faces of power (decision-making, agenda-setting and preference-shaping) \nframework developed by Steven Lukes (2004 ). As it is well known, her analysis is \nbuilt on four main structures: security, production, finance and knowledge, and this \ngives the researcher the opportunity to focus on both the material and the ideational \nsources of power. She would also emphasise that while IR scholars are mostly \nconcerned with relational power, and political scientists focus predominantly on \nthe institutional settings at the national level, international political economists \nspecialise on the power structures of the world economy, not least because (inter -\nnational) economists tend to avoid these questions. Her focus on structures does \nnot mean, however, that she neglected agency in her analysis. To the contrary, she \nwas one of the first IPE scholars who insisted on incorporating non-state actors, \nespecially corporate ones, in power analyses, as well as dominant discourses and \nideas. Hence, her conceptual framework fits well with the technological, agential \nand ordering processes outlined by the editors of this volume.\nHer four structures are, therefore, \u2018liquid\u2019. They overlap and influence each \nother in feedback loops, and they cover both the direct interactions between \nactors but also the social (including the institutional) relations through which \nthey are constituted. In this regard, Strange\u00b4s framework is capable to achieve \nboth. Analyse the power transformations in the key fields of basic human needs \nsuch as security, production, finance and knowledge (which could be categorised \nas the vertical dimension of power) but also capture the four types of power: \ncompulsory, institutional, structural and productive \u2013 as developed by Barnet and \nDuvall (2005 )\u2013 and which go from direct coercion to more diffuse aspects of \ninfluence (and hence can be labelled as the horizontal dimension of power). This \nbreadth and depth in the approach allows to grasp the material and ideational \naspects of power, but also how at certain points in history, one of the vertical \nstructures might become more salient, and influential, over the other three. Argu -\nably, in today\u2019s digital era this is precisely the case of the knowledge structure, \nwhich is transforming the \u2018background\u2019 of the world order, as conceptualised in \nthis volume.\nStrange, due to her journalistic background, was both eclectic and visionary, \nand this is why her conceptual framework \u2013 developed even before the collapse of \nthe Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War \u2013 remains prescient today. As Hag-\ngart (2017 , p. 165) has noted, \u2018it is no exaggeration to state that, if anything, the \nextent of the potentially transformative nature of the information revolution is sig -\nnificantly understudied within the mainstream of International Political Economy \n(IPE) scholarship\u2019. A  survey of what has been published over the past few years \nin the Review of International Political Economy  (RIPE), the flagship journal in \nthe discipline, proves this. With very few exceptions (Rafi Atal, 2020 ), the IPE \nliterature has not covered sufficiently the impact of digital disruptions upon the \npower structures of the world economy. Most of the analysis is done by specialists \nin the specific fields of communication and technology studies and has only a niche \nappearance in IPE journals.\n\n200  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nThis neglect \u2018leads to an underestimation of the extent to which the control over \nknowledge itself, rather than finance and production, is becoming (or more cau -\ntiously, has the potential to become) the foundation of economic power\u2019 ( Haggart, \n2017 , p. 165). Incidentally, to fill this gap, and examine the impact of the knowl -\nedge economy on the other structures, Haggart and his co-authors, in a special issue \nin the Journal of Information Policy , built precisely on a \u2018strangean\u2019 framework \ndue to its comprehensiveness and liquidity. The digital transformations we are wit -\nnessing today, shaped by the datafication, speed and pervasiveness conceptualised \nin the introduction of this volume, emanate from the knowledge structure, but they \nspill over to the other structures and by doing so have the potential to change the \nbalance of power and influence in all of them (see also Chapters  3 and 10 in this \nvolume). To analyse these digital disruptions, which are transforming both agential \nand ordering processes, an IPE approach needs to be necessarily interdisciplinary.\nHence, a \u2018strangean\u2019 approach to power comes with a few features. First, the \nconcept of security needs to be analysed beyond its traditional and narrower focus \non state actors, highlighting how the authority of the state can be undermined by \nthe rise of not only other states but also mighty corporations with their own private \nauthority. It is also important to stress that, from a historical perspective, not only \nrising but also declining powers can bring instability to the international order. This \nis especially relevant today when analysing US-China geopolitical rivalry. Another \naspect to consider is that geography, culture and different historical circumstances \ncan change intersubjective perceptions on security. Every society aspires to the val -\nues of security, wealth, justice, and freedom, but their prioritisation and hierarchical \nordering differs depending on specific values and conditions. Again, from a contem -\nporary perspective, we can see that domestically while China has traditionally put \nsecurity and stability first, the United States and the European Union have chosen \nto prioritise freedom, albeit through the pursuit of wealth in the former, and through \nthe quest for justice in the latter. The socioeconomic models and attitudes, which \narise from the specific configuration and prioritisation of these values, determine \nthe attitude towards new technologies. The response to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nwhere the use of high tech was ubiquitous in China, and other parts of East Asia, has \nshown this very clearly. Whether it will change the hierarchical order in the West \nand put security first is one of the big questions of our time. Here it is also important \nto consider issues around social security, and how its provision by the state could be \nundermined by corporate tax evasion and elusion. In the aftermath of the pandemic, \nand its impact on inequality, this topic is more relevant today than ever.\nWhen looking at the productive and financial structures, today power is increas -\ningly intangible and resides in the hands (or better in the minds) of those that have \naccess to information rather than to capital. Digital capital dominates. Strange \nalready foresaw the accumulation of power in the financial sector, precisely \nbecause of this access to information, and she indicated already how geopolitical \nrivalries would pivot not so much on the fight for land and resources but rather \non the technological race. This is precisely what we are seeing today between the \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  201\nUnited States, China and the European Union in the new digital battles around Big \nData, semiconductors, 5G and artificial intelligence, with the threat of a decoupling \nbetween China and the West quite present. Here it is important to highlight that \npowerful actors are not only those who have access to information, but also those \nthat can deny this access to others. China stands out here as being able to deny \naccess to its market to many Western high tech and media companies.\nThis leads us to the debates on transformational disruptions. Usually, the mon -\netary (and therefore credit) system, due to its importance for the economy, tends \nto suffer even less revolutions than the political system. However, new innova -\ntions usually distribute new cards to compete at the international level, and hence \nproduce new winners and losers (the rise of Silicon Valley in the past 30  years is \na good example). As mentioned, the knowledge structure sometimes is so strong \nthat affects the finance structure pervasively: digitalisation has indeed fostered \nfinancialisation. But, from a \u2018strangean\u2019 perspective, ultimately it is not new tech -\nnologies that bring great transformations in the distribution of power, but rather \nchanges in the beliefs system. The ideational changes the material. Whether the rise \nof China will bring this normative change, be it because its socioeconomic model \nbecomes more attractive, or because the United States and the European Union \nmanage to improve theirs in response, is another of the big questions of our time. \nThis will determine whether we are in an era of changes or a change of era, and \ntherefore closer to a revolution.\nThe rest of the chapter is organised as follows: the next four sections will ana -\nlyse how digital technology is changing power relations in the four structures of \npower: security, production, finance and knowledge. These are evidently divided \nfor analytical purposes, but there are many overlaps and spill-overs, and digital \ntechnologies cut across them. The last section presents the conclusions. The over -\nall argument of the chapter, within the framework provided by the editors of this \nvolume, is that new digital technologies (new knowledge) have changed the struc -\ntural order and that this has modified agential processes to the point that a new \nre-ordering of the structures is taking place. The digital era brought globalisation \nand financialisation, but with it also the Global Financial Crisis, the Great Reces -\nsion, geopolitical rivalry and global populism. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 \npandemic (which can be linked to climate change, but is outside the scope of this \nchapter given that other contributors cover this topic) and in the midst of the War \nin Ukraine it is likely that we will have more states  and less markets  (going back \nto Susan Strange\u2019s book title) in the international political economy. Whether this \nwill bring a more embedded liberalism ( Ruggie, 1982 ) or an authoritarian order \n(Diamond, Plattner,  & Walker, 2016 ) is to be seen.\nSecurity Structure\nIn the realm of security, understood here in a broad sense, perhaps the main impact \nof the digital revolution has been the explosion of cyber warfare and surveillance \n\n202  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nactivity. It is not within the scope of this analysis to cover this area (other chapters \nin this volume, see Chapter  7), but from an IPE perspective (in terms of under -\nstanding better who has access to information and who not) it is relevant to study \nthe field of cyber corporate or industrial espionage (Hou  & W ang, 2020). Gather -\ning economic intelligence to gain a competitive advantage is a practice as old as \ninternational trade, but remote access via the internet to the communication and \nstorage devices of any company has increased the possibility of accessing sensitive \ninformation, and therefore the vulnerability of most of them. The digital element, \nand the easiness to remain anonymous in cyberspace, makes it also more difficult to \nidentify those guilty of stealing intellectual property and trade secrets. But in gen -\neral, there is a strong consensus that Russia and China are particularly active in this \nfield. In 2011, for example, the software security firm McAfee revealed Operation \nShady Rat ( Alperovitch, 2011 ) which up to then was considered the largest com -\nputer hacking operation ever initiated. Over the span of five years, what appeared \nto be Chinese state-sponsored operatives had targeted 70 institutions in the United \nStates and other 13 countries, and by doing so achieved \u2018the biggest transfer of \nwealth in terms of intellectual property in history\u2019, according to Dmitri Alperovitch \n(2011 , p. 2), vice president of threat research at McAfee. He then coined the phrase \nthat one could divide the \u2018Fortune Global 2000 firms into two categories: those that \nknow they\u2019ve been compromised and those that don\u2019t yet know\u2019.\nFacts and figures about cyber espionage have traditionally been hard to access, \nbecause states and companies have been afraid to compromise their reputation by \nrevealing they had been hacked. However, ever since Jamie Metlz (2011 ), former \nofficial in the US National Security Council, rang the alarm bell on this subject a \ndecade ago the topic has become mainstream. The Center for Strategic  & Interna -\ntional Studies (2021), for instance has a timeline record since 2006 of all major \ncyberattacks on \u2018Government agencies, defence and high-tech companies, or eco -\nnomic crimes with losses of more than a million dollars\u2019 and other US think tanks \nhave covered this topic in depth ( Laskai  & Segal, 2018 ; Levite  & Jinghua, 2019 ; \nLieberthal  & Singer, 2012 ). Experts in the field believe that 80% of all industrial \nespionage is done by Chinese hackers and that they include stealing trade secrets, \nmanufacturing capabilities, material development techniques and data, consumer \nmarket data, source code, software, among others ( Eftimiades, 2018 ). The annual \ncosts of these attacks are estimated at around $320  billion for the US economy and \n\u20ac60 billion for the European Union, although these figures might be conservative \ngiven that most companies do not reveal (or do not know) that they have been com -\npromised. A  recent study by PwC (2018) for the European Commission estimates \nthat 20% of all European companies have suffered a breach.\nNonetheless, Russia and China are not the only countries where state intelli -\ngence or military units collude with national corporate champions to enhance the \ncompetitiveness of their economies. The United States ( Kirschbaum, 2014 ) and \nFrance ( France 24, 2011 ), in particular, have been accused of gathering this type of \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  203\nillegal economic intelligence too. What is clear is that \u2018while traditional national \nsecurity intelligence gathering was focused on hard security matters, over the past \n20 years national and economic security have become indivisible\u2019 ( Pellegrino, \n2015 , p. 1).\nThis is related to the debate around surveillance systems. The power of corpo -\nrate tech giants like Google and Facebook, based precisely on datafication, speed \nand pervasiveness as explained by the editors of this volume in the introduction, \nhas been denounced by Shoshana Zuboff in The Age of Surveillance Capitalism  \n(2019 ). Although in principle this topic could be the object of the next section of \nthis chapter dedicated to the production field, this is a good example of overlaps \nand spill-overs. The reality is that access to our personal data has gone beyond \ncommercial activity to know our preferences and desires for advertisement pur -\nposes to encroach on our personal freedoms. We have moved from economies \nof scale to economies of action able to change human behaviour through digital \ninstrumentation. Zuboff argues, this\ninstrumentarian power will not threaten you with terror or murder. No soldiers \nwill appear to drag you to the gulag or the camp. This new species of power \nworks remotely, engineering subliminal cues, social comparison dynamics, \nrewards and punishments, and varieties of enforcers to shape behaviour that \naligns with its commercial interests.\n(Zuboff, 2020 )\nIn this sense we might be confronting a socioeconomic revolution. The same way \nthat industrial capitalism intensified the means of production, surveillance capital -\nism is doing the same with the means of behavioural modification. The Cambridge \nAnalytica alliance with Facebook to influence the 2016 Brexit referendum vote \nin the United Kingdom is a good example ( Scott, 2019 ). This new phenomenon \nthreatens personal freedoms and therefore needs to be classified as a (human) secu -\nrity threat because it is undermining the social stability of liberal democracies from \nboth the top and the bottom. It creates important societal inequalities in wealth \nand access to knowledge, and therefore in power; and polarises and makes toxic \ncontemporary political debates, which in the United States in early 2021 have led \nto the assault to the Capitol.\nSurveillance systems are even more ubiquitous in non-democratic regimes like \nthe Chinese one, and here the changes have been profound. Chinese tech giants \nsuch as Alibaba, Tencent or Baidu have a similar, or even greater, instrumentar -\nian power than their Western equivalents, and their increasingly tight cooperation \nwith the government makes them even more effective in shaping the behaviour of \nChinese citizens. The Internet and social media were welcomed by many techno-  \nutopians for their emancipatory potential, and to some extent, it is true that they \nhave helped many Chinese netizens voice their grievances, and even organise to \n\n204  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nfight for common causes such as less pollution and corruption; simultaneously \nhowever, the intense surveillance of these communication channels by the Govern -\nment has intensified its authoritarian grip on society ( Khalil, 2020 ). The army of \nInternet watchers deployed by the Chinese state to monitor the public debate and \ncensor any criticisms that could put the legitimacy of the Communist party in dan -\nger now has the capacity to capture the sentiment of the population, allow griev -\nances to be voiced as a pressure valve, but also suffocate any attempt of dissent \nand insurrection. Here the sticks of \u2018forcing\u2019 are certainly in use. These surveil -\nlance methods, which range from communication censorship to face-recognition, \nhave been used both against human rights activists throughout Mainland China \nand for the massive repression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang. None -\ntheless, they have also been very effective in tackling crime and impeding social \nunrest, which is why Chinese firms, through \u2018enticing\u2019 and \u2018winning over\u2019, export \nthese surveillance technologies to the rest of Asia, and to Latin America and Africa \n(Mozur, Kessel,  & Chan, 2019 ). Here it is important to highlight that all big high-\ntech firms in China, no matter whether public or private, collaborate with and are \nsupported by the Chinese state ( Blanchette, 2021 ).\nBy doing so, they also export China\u2019s illiberal model of capitalism, which brings \nus back to the four main values described by Strange. Specifically, in the Chinese \ncase, it represents how security is prioritised over other values, something shared \nby other authoritarian regimes that are eager to follow in its tracks. In turn, this is \naccelerating the formation of an international market for surveillance tech, which \nmay well end up being dominated by China ( Feldstein, 2019 ). It is also likely that \nthe value of security will increase in many other parts of the world in the after -\nmath of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the War in Ukraine, especially in (Eastern) \nEurope. East Asian countries, including not only China but also South Korea and \nTaiwan, have been highly effective in fighting the virus thanks to the use of new \ntechnologies such as location apps. In the West, these technologies have not been \nused for fear that they would be too intrusive in the private sphere of citizens, but \nthe debate has not been closed and many in the West have advocated for granting \nthis type of information gathering powers to the state in order to protect public \nhealth ( Whitelaw, Mamas, Topol,  & Van Spall, 2020 ).\nChina\u2019s much-criticised social credit (better translated as social reputation) \nsystem (although systems in plural is a better description of the phenomenon) is \nbased precisely on the premise that it makes a more harmonious society ( Mac-\nSithigh  & Siems, 2019 ). By classifying consumption and social life habits, in prin -\nciple a neutral algorithm punishes illegal and unethical behaviour and rewards law \nand moral abiding citizens. This techno-authoritarianism not only fosters social \npeace, but it also makes China\u2019s socioeconomic model extremely competitive \n(Meissner, 2017 ). The gathering, storage and processing of Big Data and then \ntransforming them into artificial intelligence (datafication) makes the exercise of \ncentral planning much more effective. One factor that made the Soviet Union \neconomically inefficient was the lack of information from the different parts of the \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  205\nsystem which made the allocation of resources faulty (see the \u2018economic calcula -\ntion problem\u2019 prominent in Austrian economics, particularly von Mises (1990 ) \nand Hayek (1945 )). China\u2019s state capitalism could overcome this problem by gath -\nering information from its citizens, pervasively and at high speed, through their \nmobile devices, and even more so if it can force millions of companies to share \ntheir data. If this is done in an effective way the Chinese economy has the potential \nto become extremely competitive, with its model becoming a prominent rival to \nthose of the West, not least because when it comes to experimenting and testing \nin artificial intelligence China has different ethical attitudes than many Westerns \nsocieties ( Blanchette, 2021 ).\nIn this regard, we can safely say that surveillance capitalism both in the West \nand in China is transforming agential and ordering processes and they feed each \nother. The likely outcome is a more pervasive state. This is obvious in China with \nthe reinforcement of its state capitalism under Xi Jinping, but also in the United \nStates and the European Union where calls for more regulation and state interven -\ntion have become louder.\nProduction Structure\nDigitalisation has transformed the production structure of the world economy. As \nRichard Baldwin (2016) has explained, over the past 30  years, in what could be \nlabelled as the fourth industrial revolution, global value chains have become the \ncentral networks of our economies and have created a \u2018great convergence\u2019 between \ndeveloped and developing countries. Multinational corporations have not only out -\nsourced labour-intensive work. In order to keep manufacturing processes in sync \nacross the world, and thanks to the development and massive deployment of infor -\nmation and communications technology, they have also outsourced higher value-\nadded activities related to areas of design, marketing and managerial and technical \nknow-how. This has been beneficial for developing countries because, without hav -\ning to set up the whole production structure from scratch, they can specialise in cer -\ntain processes, and create and retain more wealth. As Branko Milanovic (2016 ) has \npointed out, this has generated new middle classes in emerging markets, especially \nin Asia. It has also been very profitable for the shareholders of the multinational \ncompanies involved in these chains, because they have become more cost-effective \n(Deloitte, 2008 ), and for the top professionals in the best-paid jobs, which usually \nare linked to the knowledge economy. The losers, however, for both Baldwin and \nMilanovic, have been the middle classes in the West which have seen how digital \ntechnology has undermined their job prospects, either through the automation of \nprocess at home or through outsourcing of ever more managerial activity abroad.\nThis has generated more inequality and concentration of power. In the Great \nReversal  Thomas Philippon (2019 ) explains, for instance, how competition has \nbeen curtailed in many sectors of the US economy and how this has generated a \ndownward spiral of lower investment, productivity and growth, and consequently \n\n206  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nlower wages and higher income inequality. As a matter of fact, over the past \n30 years, productivity growth has been lowering in the developed OECD econo -\nmies and, on top of that, there has been a substantial decoupling between produc -\ntivity and wages ( OECD, 2018 ).\nEver bigger companies not only are able to take over their smaller competitors \ndue to their wealth and power but can also have a legal and regulatory framework \nthat fits their interests due to their lobbying efforts. In this regard, the European \nUnion, with the European Commission\u2019s insistence on competition law, has per -\nformed better than the United States despite a common perception to the contrary. \nThe digital revolution has brought higher productivity, but these increases have \nbeen concentrated in big tech firms, without trickling down the production pyra -\nmid to SMEs, which conform the greatest bulk of any economy. Qureshi (2020 ), \nfor example, points to the differences in productivity growth from 2001 and 2013 \nin OECD countries, with leading tech firms experiencing a 35% increase in labour \nproductivity, in contrast to the 5% increase experienced in smaller firms. This lack \nof dissemination, highlighted also by Andy Haldane (2018 ), explains why despite \nthe advancements in digital technology the overall productivity levels in OECD \ncountries remain relatively low.\nBefore the global financial crisis, and for several decades, corporate power laid \nwithin big (investment) banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan, today the \ntop spots, and the influence and power associated with them, belong to the big \ntech companies such as Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon and Tesla, \nwhich combined represent now close to 25% of the S&P 500 stock exchange; this \nis a ratio never seen before, not even during the dot com bubble of the turn of the \ncentury. It is no surprise therefore that both European and recently US authorities \nare starting to apply anti-trust legislation against these companies. Even in China \nFIGURE 8.1  Labour productivity and real average and real median compensation.\n(Author\u2019s creation)\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  207\nFIGURE 8.2  Evolution of US concentration, profits, labour shares and investment.\nSource:  Covarrubias, Guti\u00e9rrez, and Philippon (2019 )\n\n208  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nJack Ma\u2019s Alibaba, which wanted to combine its tech innovation with financial \nactivities, has become so powerful that the Communist Party has seen it as a threat \nand curtailed its ambitions ( Bloomberg News, 2021 ).\nThe power of these companies is reflected in their capacity to elude taxes. The \nOECD (2015 , 2021 ) calculates that around $240  billion are lost to tax avoidance by \nmultinational companies every year and that this trend can be partly attributed to \nthe development of the digital economy, which exacerbates the risk of base erosion \nand profit shifting. This is a major concern, already denounced by Susan Strange \nalmost 30  years ago, which has only become more prominent after the Great \nRecession and the even more virulent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is \nmost evidently seen in the revenues of these companies shooting through the roof \nwhile public debt, corporate bankruptcies and unemployment rates follow a wor -\nrying upward trend ( Oxfam, 2020 ). The work of Gabriel Zucman (2021 ) has been \nparticularly informative in showing how through profit shifting via tax havens, \nmultinational corporations avoid paying their due taxes. In this global battle the \nEU, while losing in total around 170\u20ac billion in tax evasion, is split into two camps: \non the one hand, there are countries like Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, which \nact as prominent tax havens within the Union and who benefit from companies \nseeking loopholes to pay less taxes; on the other, the biggest economies bear the \nbrunt of the losses, with Germany and France, respectively, losing 26% and 22% \nof their potential tax revenues. China, by contrast, only loses 3% ( Zucman, 2021 ).\nThe reality is that the American GAFA (Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon), \nas well as smaller firms like Netflix, Uber or Airbnb, benefit from operating in large \nFIGURE 8.3  Tax revenue lost due to profit shifting.\n(Author\u2019s creation)\n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  209\nand mature markets, but pay a smaller fraction of their revenues than what they \nshould according to the corresponding tax laws.\nThis is highly problematic because, if we bring back Baldwin\u2019s analysis, and that \nof others such as Lonergan and Blyth (2020 ) and Martin Sandbu (2020 ), the only \nway to preserve globalisation and avoid social unrest and protectionist instincts is \nvia a redistributive, and even an entrepreneurial ( Mazzucato, 2018 ), state. A  state \nthat can provide the skills and education needed so that the children of today\u2019s \nanxious middle classes can remain competitive and have meaningful jobs; steer the \ngreen transformation that is necessary to have more sustainable growth; the means, \nstrategy and direction to improve the rural and former industrial areas which have \nseen a decline over the past 30  years; the public funding required to invest in inno -\nvation and research to remain at the cutting edge of technological progress, and on \ntop of that perhaps the funding for universal basic income schemes for those who \nare not able to find new jobs or those who work in the gig economy of the digital \nage but do not earn enough to have a dignified life. Both the OECD and the World \nBank have done some valuable analysis on these fronts (Ramos, 2017; Gentilini, \nGrosh, Rigolini,  & Yemtsov, 2020 ).\nIn order to engage in all of these tasks the state will need to increase its reve -\nnues, and this necessarily implies higher taxes for the well-off, who will not accept \nthis lightly, therefore making political compromises in an already polarised society \neven more difficult. Research shows that higher earners in developed economies \nare increasingly more disenfranchised with democracy, in part because of their fear \nof higher taxes down the road, and this means that the appeal of having an authori -\ntarian regime, similar to that of China, might be greater than previously thought \nin Western liberal democracies ( Foa, Klassen, Slade, Rand,  & Collins, 2020 ) In \na way we could be in front of what some have labelled the \u2018latinamericanisation\u2019 \nof the West: societies characterised by higher inequality, crime and social unrest, \nmore populist politicians, and weaker institutions. This would make Dani Rodrik\u00b4s \n(2012 ) prediction right that hyper-globalisation is incompatible with both national \nsovereignty and pluralist democracy. Others, however, like Martin Sandbu (2020 ), \ninsist that a social-democratic capitalism is still compatible with globalisation, of \nwhich the highly competitive European Nordic countries remain a good example.\nGermany, on the other hand, in spite of being the European Union\u2019s industrial \npowerhouse, is lagging behind in digitalisation as acknowledged by its former \nMinister of Economy, Peter Altmaier (2019 ). In his view, in every industrial revo -\nlution, there were key technologies that were fundamental to compete with other \ncountries and increase the living standards of the population. In the first industrial \nrevolution it was the steam engine and the railway, in the second, electricity and the \ncombustion engine (Germany did particularly well in this one with its car indus -\ntry); the third featured computers and the internet; and the current one is based on \ndigital platforms and artificial intelligence, with both Germany and the European \nUnion as a whole are trailing behind the United States and China. This, in his \nview, is extremely problematic because the lack of access to data might undermine \n\n210 Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nEuropean sovereignty, and the lack of competitiveness in AI is likely to accelerate \nthe decline in living standards in the old continent. He goes so far as to even say \nthat if Europe does not catch up quickly, the stability of the up-to-now quite suc -\ncessful Rhenish social market economy model might be undermined, and with it \nthe democratic institutions that underpin it. Overall, then this relates to the power \nasymmetry that exists between the United States \u2013 which has a state apparatus able \nto enforce, entice and winning-over \u2013 and the European Union, which traditionally \nhas refrained from integrating its economic policy ambitions with its geopolitical \ngoals ( Farrell  & Newman, 2019 ; Leonard et  al., 2019 ).\nGermany and other parts of central and northern Europe still have a strong \ncompetitive advantage in specialised, high-precision manufacturing. The Mittel -\nstand  is the backbone of this economic muscle, and with the concept of Indus -\ntry 4.0 (which incorporates new technologies like 3D printing) there is a strong \nwillingness to digitalise it ( Santos, Mehrsai, Barros, Ara\u00fajo,  & Ares, 2017 ). It is \nhere where the debate around 5G and the internet of things comes into the discus -\nsion. Europe can \u2018servitise\u2019 its manufacturing capacity and also start collecting \ndata, hence, improving its computing and artificial intelligence development. As \na matter of fact, there are two European companies (Nokia and Ericsson) which \nare at the cutting-edge of 5G technology. In this field Europe does not perform \nbadly, while China with Huawei is at the forefront of the race, and with the United \nStates lacking a company that can compete in their terms. But there are certain \naspects that put China, other parts of East Asia (like South Korea), and the United \nStates in an advantage. First, the deployment of 5G networks is more advanced \nin China and the United States than in Europe. Second, European networks rely \nto a great extent on Chinese technology from Huawei, therefore being exposed to \nthe security risks that this may entail. Finally, while European companies are still \ncompetitive in hardware (as mentioned in the cases of Nokia and Ericsson), the \nreal monetisation of the 5G networks will be done via software, and in this area, \nSilicon Valley and China\u2019s big tech companies are investing much more than their \nEuropean peers ( Ortega, 2020 ).\nTherefore, with 5G or even 6G, what may happen is what occurred with internet \naccess in the 1990s and 2000s. The European communication operators were the \nleaders in the field, but the monetisation was achieved by American digital plat -\nforms such as Google, Facebook or Amazon. This is worrying for the European \nUnion and explains why there is a big push now to increase strategic autonomy \nbeyond the security field and reach greater economic sovereignty, including, and \nabove all, in the digital sphere. With the aim to reduce the dependency on third coun -\ntries, especially the United States, there are first attempts to create pan-European  \nindustrial projects like the cloud services Gaia X or advanced semiconductors; \nand there are also talks on how to make personal data (the \u2018new oil\u2019) more eas -\nily accessible and transferable, to foster competition and reduce the power of the \nUnited States and Chinese tech giants ( EP, 2020 ). Ultimately, this is likely to lead \nto more protectionism and deeper geopolitical rivalries, with a greater role for the \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  211\nstate, and to a distancing from the free trade and free competition era that was so \ndominant before the global financial crisis. The aftermath of the pandemic, the War \nin Ukraine, and increased US-China rivalry will only accelerate this trend, and in \nthis regard, given the change of norms and values, we might be in front of a new \nrevolution.\nFinance Structure\nDigitalisation has helped in the \u2018financialisation\u2019 of many developed economies. \nThis was a trend that worried Susan Strange (1997[1986 ]) already in the mid-1980s \nand has since become an even bigger concern. As the former chair of the UK finan -\ncial services authority, Adair Turner (2015 ), has denounced, the swollen finances \nthat the world has experienced have had serious negative effects. As Strange \nwarned in the early 1990s, a sophisticated financial system is absolutely necessary \nfor a developed economy, but when it grows too big, complex and deregulated \nit becomes highly destabilising and prone to crises (the most recent example is \nthe 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis) and generates income and wealth inequali -\nties that lead to social and political instability. Finance is fundamental to connect \nborrowers (entrepreneurs) and creditors (investors), and thus bring about potential \nfuture wealth to be enjoyed and made productive in the present.\nAdditionally, it also provides a series of hedging and insurance mechanisms \n(derivatives) to buffer present and future risks. But when \u2018financialisation\u2019 is done \nin excess \u2013 and digitalisation has reinforced this process \u2013 it can generate seri -\nous negative political, economic and social disruptions (Currie  & Lagoarde-Segot, \n2017; Lagoarde-Segot  & Currie, 2018 ). The ratio of global (public and private) \ndebt to GDP was already quite high in the run-up to the global financial crisis, \ncontinued to grow during the Great Recession, and has the potential to become \ndramatic as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, because, yet again, a lot of \nthe private debt will become public debt. At the end of 2020, the overall debt (this \nis both public and private debt) reached an all-time high of 277  trillion, which is \nthe equivalent of 365% of world GDP ( Wheatley, 2020 ). This figure is even more \ndramatic for advanced economies, which have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 432%. These \nlevels \u2013 never seen in modern history \u2013 are so high that the possibility to limit \nthe creation of money through the fractional banking system is now openly dis -\ncussed by mainstream economists such as the former chair of the Bank of England, \nMervyn King (2016 ).\nThe truth is that in all areas one can look finance has swollen. The value of the \nUS stock exchange, as mentioned before due in great part to the digital high-tech \ncompanies, is at a record high and represents the equivalent of 150% of the US \nGDP. According to data from the Bank of International Settlements (BIS), the for -\neign exchange daily market turnover (even with trade not growing at the same rate \nthan in the high days of hyper-globalisation) has reached in 2019 the record figure \nof $6.6  trillion ( BIS, 2019a ). This means that the value of currencies exchanged \n\n212 Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nevery day is now ten times bigger than in 1989 and is the equivalent of the annual \nGDP of Germany and the United Kingdom combined. The derivates market, for \nits part, has come down from the peak of over $700  trillion in 2013, but by 2020 it \nwas still at over $600  trillion worth of transactions ( BIS, 2021 ), which is four times \nthe world\u2019s annual GDP. All these activities, which continue to have New York \nand London as the global financial centres, have of course been accelerated by \nfinancial innovations such as structured debt instruments, high-frequency trading, \nand increased computational power. Algorithms are now in charge of increasing \namounts of trades in fractions of a second, which has created a whole industry, tra -\nditionally dominated by the Bloomberg terminal, focused on sharing market infor -\nmation as fast as possible ( Popper, 2015 ). Datafication, speed and pervasiveness \nappear here again.\nHaving access to these data and to this level of computational and operative \nspeed is expensive and therefore creates barriers for retail investors. Furthermore, \nthe speed of the transactions has increased even more the speculative dimension \nof modern finance, leading to criticisms about how this trading activity does not \nreflect market fundamentals and is increasingly negative for society ( Bernards  & \nCampbell-Verduyn, 2019 ; Currie  & Lagoarde-Segot, 2017 ). While sometimes it is \npresented as the most advanced stage of efficient markets and rational expectations, \nhigh-frequency trading (HFT) continues to be driven by information asymmetries \nand herding effects, as evidenced by the numerous flash crashes experienced over \nthe past years ( Bellia, Christensen, Kolokolov, Pelizzon,  & Ren\u00f2, 2020 ).\nNonetheless, the arrival of new technologies has also facilitated new market \nplayers. According to the Financial Stability Board (2020 ), over the past decade, \nthe non-bank financial intermediation sector (or also called shadow banking) has \ngrown more than the traditional, and more regulated, banking sector, and repre -\nsents now almost half of the global financial system. The main drivers have been \ncollective investment vehicles such as hedge funds, money market funds, and other \ninvestment funds. All of these new players do not collect savings deposits protected \nby law in most jurisdictions in the case of a default, and therefore they are consid -\nered systemically less risky and are under less stringent regulation. However, their \nsudden growth has started to worry many regulators and has drawn complaints \nfrom traditional banks, including European giants like Banco Santander, who feel \nthat the level playing field is now tilted against them. The new players, emboldened \nby advances in fintech, are now providing almost all financial services traditionally \noffered by banks but with less regulatory constraints. In principle, the disadvantage \nof non-banking intermediaries is that they do not have access to the emergency \nlending window of central banks. However after a decade of quantitative easing, \nextremely low interest rates and as a result, a generalised desperate search for yield \nby investors, there was no shortage of liquidity (except in the cases where the repu -\ntation of the intermediary is seriously questioned, or where there is major instabil -\nity in markets as in March  2020, when COVID-19 made its global appearance) \nuntil the FED started to raise interests in 2022\n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  213\nShadow banking has particularly increased in the euro area. Its global share \nis now larger than that of the United States, with jurisdictions such as Luxem -\nburg, Ireland and the Netherlands functioning as intermediation channels for global \ninvestment funds ( Doyle, Hermans, Molitor,  & W eistroffer, 2016 ). However, the \nfintech revolution has impacted European banks less than American ones because \nof the latter\u2019s market dominance and scale (they are more capable of buying fintech \nstart-ups), and a near monopoly on customer data and key services such as foreign \nexchange and payments. But this is likely to change in the future, with the arrival \nof open banking directives and new data-sharing plans between banks and fintech \nfirms at the request of customers ( Seru, 2019 ). The global fintech hubs coincide \nwith traditional financial centres: New York, London and Singapore feature high \non the rankings, but there are new cities making inroads such as San Francisco, \nBerlin or Mumbai. As a fintech ecosystems index highlights, \u2018eight of the world\u2019s \n20 most important financial centres do not feature in the world\u2019s 20 biggest fintech \nhubs. And of the world\u2019s top 100 leading fintech cities, almost half are in emerg -\ning markets\u2019 ( Findexable, 2020 ). This is a good example of how new technologies \nchange the distribution of power. China\u2019s big tech giants, like Alibaba and Tencent, \nstand out here as they have slowly moved from being e-commerce and social media \nproviders, to mobile payments facilitators and suppliers of non-banking financial \nservices. They are part of a bigger trend over the past decade of increased shadow \nbanking in China, which has triggered alarm bells in Beijing and forced a regula -\ntory crackdown due to latent systemic risks associated with exposures to cumu -\nlative non-performing loans ( CGTN, 2020 ). Whether similar concerns will bring \ntighter regulation in the European Union and the United States is to be seen. Events \nsuch as the GameStop battle between short-selling hedge funds and coordinated \nretail investors via the platform Reddit might indicate that we are close to the peak \nof the bubble, or mania territory in the Kindlebergian sense, which usually pre -\ncedes the panic and the crash ( Cassidy, 2021 ). The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank \nand Credit Suisse in 2023 might just be the first victims.\nThe arrival of new technologies like blockchain has also transformed the cur -\nrency world. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have received considerable atten -\ntion and have generated new discussions on whether they can be considered money \nor simply an investment commodity like gold. In many ways, Bitcoin has reminis -\ncences of the gold standard. Its promoters claim that one of its stabilising features is \nthat it is difficult to produce (miners need to have enormous computational power \nto generate new coins), and its supply is limited to 21  million ( Aratani, 2021 ). This \nis in stark contrast to the current fiat money regime of sovereign currencies which, \nfor many, is prone to be mismanaged and misused by political interference and is \nprone to monetary instability. One can dismiss Bitcoin as the new fetish of gold \nbugs, ultra-libertarians and cunning speculators (its value has quadrupled in the \nfirst year of the COVID-19 pandemic reaching over $40,000), but its attractiveness \npoints to socioeconomic tensions in our societies. Historically, the emergence of \nprivate \u2018near\u2019 monies has always coincided with periods where the legitimacy of \n\n214 Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nthe public authorities was questioned. There is a stark correlation between politi -\ncal and monetary instability ( Martin, 2014 ). The last decade possesses all of the \nsymptoms of a tumultuous time: the global financial crisis, the great recession, the \neuro crisis, the rise of populism, Brexit, the arrival of Trump to the White House, \nthe intensification of the geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China, \nthe asymmetric impact of COVID-19 and the War in Ukraine have shaken the \nstructures of the international political economy, and presage a time of great trans -\nformations which again can make this a revolutionary era.\nIf Bitcoin has raised eyebrows in the most powerful central banks, Facebook\u2019s \nattempt to launch its own currency Libra has generated fierce resistance. With \n2.8 billion active monthly users worldwide, Facebook has the potential to rival, or \nat least seriously undermine, the authority of the most powerful sovereigns in mon -\netary affairs. This is the reason why the G7 has quickly convened a working group \nof top financial policymakers and regulators to study the project, and have come \nup with a report critical with the initiative that points to its destabilising potential \n(BIS, 2019b ). Faced with this wave of criticism, Facebook has now scaled down \nthe project and reduced it to a mere payments system like PayPal (if it comes to fru -\nition at all), but the debate around Libra, or Diem, has accelerated the race to start \nissuing sovereign cryptocurrencies. The first central bank to study the introduction \nof a digital currency, which happens to be the world\u2019s oldest, was the Swedish one, \nbut the one more advanced in its implementation is the People\u2019s Bank of China, \nwhich has already launched a few pilot tests ( Bray  & Tudor-Ackroyd, 2020 ). This \nhas propelled Niall Ferguson (2019 ) to suggest that China\u2019s progress in global pay -\nments systems \u2013 for customers and companies through platforms such as Alibaba, \nWeChat or UnionPay, but also for interbank transactions via the newly created \nCross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), rival to SWIFT \u2013 has the poten -\ntial to rival the dominance of the dollar in the international monetary system. This \ntrend might accelerate with the War in Ukraine and the sanctions regime against \nRussia. Perhaps for the same reason, the European Central Bank has also acceler -\nated the modernisation of its own payments systems and is seriously thinking of \nlaunching a digital euro too. These trends suggest that we will soon have different, \nand competing, digital currency areas between the US dollar, the euro and the yuan \n(Brunnermeier, James,  & Landau, 2019 ).\nAgain, in this structure, digital disruptions are at play. Digitalisation has spurred \nfinancialisation, and this in turn has increased the levels of credit to a destabilising \nlevel. Debt is the other side of credit and where there is a liability, there is an asset. \nBut when credit is increasingly in the hands of a few \u2018haves\u2019 and the increased \ndebt burdens the majority of the \u2018have-nots\u2019, then it becomes a source of instabil -\nity. The financial structure is the most rigid one and does not undergo big revolu -\ntions, but in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the War in Ukraine, this \nmight change. Overcoming the crisis and its unequal impact, dealing with climate \nchange, and increased geopolitical rivalry are likely to augment public debt in the \ndeveloped world over the next years. This might imply the definitive end of the \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  215\nneoliberal era, and the arrival of a more state-centred regime. How the debt will \neventually be re-paid is another matter.\nKnowledge Structure\nThis is the power structure where there is the fiercest competition because, as an \nanalysis of the European Commission (2019 , p. 1) succinctly put it, \u2018those who \ncontrol digital technologies are increasingly able to influence economic, soci -\netal and political outcomes\u2019. Here is also where the different power structures \ncome together. The advances in digital technology, in both hardware and soft -\nware, have clear effects on security, production and finance, as previously elu -\ncidated. There is also a pyramid effect: the collection of data (which is labelled \nthe new oil, but it is something else entirely because it can be used multiple \ntimes for many different purposes) is the first layer, and for this physical 5G \nnetworks (covered in the production structure), but especially digital platforms, \noffering all sort of web services, are a fundamental technology. Both the United \nStates and China are strong in this field of \u2018datafication\u2019 and \u2018pervasiveness\u2019, \nwith parallel (and increasingly diverting) ecosystems, while the European Union \nis falling behind, although it could use its competitive advantage in industrial \nmachines (including robotics) to shape the Internet of Things (IoT). Then there \nis the capacity to process Big Data, and for this one needs strong computational \npower. China is investing more than any other actor on quantum computing, and \nthis is worrying both for the United States and for the European Union because \nit has implications for the security structure. As the same Commission document \n(2019 , p. 5) warns,\nadvances in quantum computing are already posing fundamental challenges to \ninformation security, as this next generation of computers will be able to break \ntraditional encryption methods near instantaneously compared with the billions \nof years of processing that would be needed using conventional computers.\nThis computational capacity is key for the next stage: artificial intelligence, where \nChina has arguably already overtaken the European Union and is catching up with \nthe United States ( Castro, McLaughlin,  & Chivot, 2019 ).\nHowever, there is one area where China is still far behind the United States: \nthe production of semiconductors. The import bill of semiconductors is greater \nthan that of oil for the former, and its vulnerabilities have been shown in the trade \nand tech war with the United States, with its tech giants Huawei and ZTE worry -\ning about being cut off from vital supplies. The Chinese government has realised \nthis fragility and is now pouring substantial amounts of funds to establish its \nown indigenous semiconductors technology around Shenzhen ( Hodiak  & Harold, \n2020 ). This strategy has also included the purchase of foreign semiconductor pro -\nducers, but for now progress is slow, and the vulnerabilities persist ( Lim, 2020 ). \n\n216 Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nNonetheless, given the nationalist spirit that is driving China\u2019s ambitions to be at \nthe same level than the United States in multiple key sectors (the Made in China \n2025 strategy is a good reflection of this, see Zenglein  & Holzmann, 2019 ) the \nmost likely outcome is that it will achieve dominance in semiconductors one day \ntoo. The level of both public and private investment (China is in the top three for \nventure capital investment in key digital technologies, see Woetzel et  al. (2017), \nand the amount of patents and STEM research and graduates (approximately \n4.7 million in 2016, therefore becoming the country with most STEM gradu -\nates, see McCarthy, 2017 ) that China produces every day foresee a formidable \npotential into the future. Interestingly, and this is also valid for China\u2019s state \ncapitalist model, the realisation is that while, in the past new inventions in the \nsecurity arena would be key to have a competitive edge in the production field, in \nthis digital revolution it might be the opposite. Increasingly, knowledge and new \ntechnologies produced in the civilian realm are transposed into the security field \n(European Commission, 2019 ), and if this trend is confirmed, it would signify a \nhistoric watershed.\nWhen it comes to the generation and dissemination of knowledge the United \nStates is still in the lead, and this is why it is increasingly curtailing the export \nof key technology to China. Its Ivy League universities top the global best uni -\nversities rankings, and the influence that American-based scholars have in most \nsciences (natural and social) is second to none. Wealthy Chinese, if they can, still \nprefer to send their kids to study in the United States, but it is also true that Chi -\nnese universities have gained greater reputation. The traditional rote learning in \nChinese education has given way to more problem-solving-based teaching, at least \nin the best universities, and this is making a difference. The dominant idea in the \nWest, supported by Acemoglu and Robinson (2013) among others, that innovation \nis incompatible with authoritarian political structures is increasingly questioned. \nChina is innovating despite having an authoritarian regime, and some might even \ngo as far as saying that in certain fields, like AI, it is innovating more than some \nWestern countries precisely  because of its techno-authoritarianism and the state\u2019s \ncapacity to gather data from 1.4  billion citizens. This level of scale makes China \nthe most powerful competitor to US dominance in world affairs since its rise as the \neconomic powerhouse in the 19th century (Woetzel et  al., 2017). The European \nUnion, on the other hand, has a relatively fragmented single market, especially in \nservices, and it struggles to commercialise and monetise its knowledge. This does \nnot mean that the European Union does not generate knowledge, as it still does in \nmany areas. It has less universities in the top 20, but the average level is arguably \nhigher than in China and the United States, and great efforts are made to guide \nthe Union towards more technical and incremental, rather than disruptive, innova -\ntion. Indeed, the leading EU countries (the Nordics and German-speaking ones, for \ninstance) provide better skills to the average student and worker than the United \nStates and China ( WEF, 2019 ).\n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  217\nWhere the United States specifically, and the anglosphere in general, is still \nvery dominant is in media networks. Outlets such as The Economist , The Financial \nTimes  and The New York Times , and agencies such as Reuters , shape the global \nconversation. This level of influence in \u2018agenda-setting\u2019 and \u2018preference-shaping\u2019 \nis a key asset in the digital age and has been met with fierce resistance by Russia \nand China. In the Russian case its activity in counter-information and fake news \nto destabilise the West has been well documented ( Giles, 2017 ), while China has \nfocused more on censoring or even banning Western media outlets. Except for the \nFT, which has an exceedingly high, almost prohibitive, subscription fee and there -\nfore is less of a threat, all major Western media with critical coverage of China\u2019s \nCommunist Party are inaccessible for the average Chinese citizen, unless she or \nhe uses an illegal VPN. The same is true for Western, mostly US, social networks \nsuch as Facebook and Twitter. Google and its services (including the search engine \nand Google maps) are also banned. This digital Chinese \u2018Great Firewall\u2019 is a good \nexample of how power is the capacity not only to generate knowledge but also \nto limit access to it. By keeping Western digital players outside its market, China \nhas been able to generate its own, more autonomous, digital ecosystem, which is \nsupervised by the Party and which is a powerful source to grasp the social mood, \nworking as a pressure valve to express discontent, but also as an effective tool to \nidentify dissent and supress it. Again, here the European Union is in a weak posi -\ntion. It does not have its own social media platforms, and its fragmented nature (27 \ncountries with distinct cultures and languages), forces its elites to read non-EU-\nbased newspapers such as the Financial Times  to follow the current affairs of their \nown union. China, on the other hand, is increasing its media presence around the \nworld ( Cook, 2021 ).\nWhere the European Union still has considerable power in regulating eco -\nnomic activity. The size and purchasing power of its internal market make it an \nindispensable target for any international company, and this attractiveness gives \nthe European Union enormous leverage, to the point of being able to confront \nthe digital tech giants of the United States and China. Microsoft was one of the \nfirst American companies which had to phase EU competition law in the 1990s, \nand since then the tension between US market power and EU market regula -\ntion has only increased, with Apple and Google, Amazon and Facebook being \ntoday the new targets of the European Commission. This \u2018Brussels Effect\u2019, as \ncoined by Anu Bradford (2020 ), has in the General Data Protection Regulation \n(GDPR) its most vivid incarnation. The GDPR has not only changed the digital \nspace in the European Union: given that it is obligatory for every company that \noperates in the European market to subject itself to it, (and as mentioned, all \nmultinationals do), its tentacles have spread to other jurisdictions, especially \nin emerging markets, which do not want to burden their companies with differ -\nent norms and standards in their market ( Bradford, 2020 ). Even the California \nPrivacy Rights Act (CPRA) borrows to a great extent the spirit and letter of the \n\n218 Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nGDPR, showing that in this terrain the European Union still has considerable \nnormative power.\nThe same can be said for environmental, social and industrial standards. The \ninfluence of Europeans in regulatory and standard-setting international bodies is \nto a certain extent even higher than that of the United States. Germany\u2019s industrial \nprowess has played an important role in setting global technical standards, a field \nwhich until recently was considered as non-politicised, at least from a Western \nperspective. This has changed in recent years, with the intensification of the geopo -\nlitical rivalry between the United States and China. The latter\u2019s economic and tech -\nnological might has also changed the landscape. By being able to produce a higher \nquantity of high-end products, it has also aimed to influence the new standards.\nWhile still considerably behind Germany, the US, France, the United Kingdom \nand Japan, China is gaining more and more of the influential secretariat posi -\ntions on Technical Committees, Subcommittees and Working Groups in the \nInternational Standardization Organization (ISO) the International Electrotech -\nnical Committee (IEC) and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU).\n(R\u00fchling, 2021 , p. 7)\nThe ambitious project of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is also enhancing \nChina\u2019s standard-setting capacity, not only in hard infrastructure and machinery, \nwhere China has developed a competitive edge, but also in the digital sphere, \nwith the 5G and 6G networks being the new frontier of knowledge and standards \n(Pop, Hua,  & Michaels, 2021 ). Whatever is agreed for these \u2018central nervous \nsystems\u2019 will have effects on the standards and ethics established for the research \nand use of artificial intelligence. Importantly, in this area geopolitical rivalry will \nlikely increase, and the likelihood of fragmented and competing digital spheres \n(which implies more decoupling) is quite high, and will probably lead to a more \nde-globalised world. Interestingly, to avoid this Germany has increased its col -\nlaboration with China in setting the new high-tech standards for Industry 4.0 so \nthat it can continue to ride the \u2018Chinese dragon\u2019, both in its domestic market and \nin its BRI ambitions.\nIn this final, and dominant structure, it is perhaps where the technological, agen -\ntial and ordering processes are most visible. Although US tech giants like Google \nhave presented themselves as decentralised systems which democratise access to \nknowledge the reality is that through \u2018winning-over\u2019 and \u2018habitualising\u2019 they are \ncentralising enormous amounts of knowledge, and therefore, power ( Atal, 2020 ). \nThe response by China to this has been to develop its own techno-authoritarianism, \nled by the state, which, in turn, has triggered a rethink both in the United States and \nin the European Union, with more state intervention, either by limiting the access \nto Western technology by China or by increasing public investment to compete \nwith the emerging superpower in the East.\n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  219\nConclusion\nAfter analysing how digital technologies have impacted the four power structures \n(security, production, finance and knowledge) of the international political econ -\nomy, the picture that emerges is the following. The digital age has distributed a new \nset of cards, as Susan Strange would put it, and this has generated new winners \nand losers. From the perspective of non-state actors, power has shifted from the \nfinancial sector concentrated in New York to the tech giants in Silicon Valley in the \nWest and in China, from industrial workers in the West to the new middle classes \nin (East) Asia and from the unskilled to high-skilled all over the world. From a \ngeopolitical and state-centric perspective China has become the biggest winner, the \nUnited States is in relative decline but still dominant, while the European Union is \nfalling behind, although it retains some relative strengths in the industrial realm. \nDatafication, speed and pervasiveness have transformed both agential and ordering \nprocess in the global economy.\nIn the security sphere, the digital age has given Chinese competitors more \nopportunities for corporate espionage and has helped accelerate China\u2019s techno -\nlogical catch-up with the West. These technological advances have had transforma -\ntive effects on the other structures: China is now capable of generating indigenous \nknowledge, and can increasingly compete with the United States and the European \nUnion, especially in the production sphere, but also progressively in the financial \none, which is historically more resilient to changes, and which is still dominated \nby the United States and the dollar. This shows how all foreground and back -\nground structures are interconnected and how digital technology, emanating from \nthe knowledge structure, cuts across them. Improvements and innovations in the \ncivilian sphere are increasingly being incorporated in the security one, not only to \ngenerate new weapons, but also to improve internal security. While traditionally \nthis has been the biggest obsession of the Chinese Communist Party, it is climbing \nthe values hierarchy in the West, which had to overcome a global pandemic that \nhas triggered the deepest economic recession since the Second World War, with \npredictably dire political and social consequences, and now is facing a protracted \nWar in Ukraine, which will also bring winners and losers, with the European Union \never more dependent on the United States for its own security and energy supply \nand Russia being more dependent on China for its economic survival.\nDo all these disruptions signify a \u2018revolution\u2019? From an international political \neconomy perspective, the structural changes in the distribution of power remain \nlimited. The United States remains the predominant power in the military sphere, \nthe security guarantor for many countries, and the most important shipping lanes \nof the world economy. The United States also has the most innovative companies \non earth, with Google in the lead. New York is the most important financial centre, \nand the US dollar is by far the most used international currency. But the tectonic \nplates of power are shifting. A  series of major geopolitical events (the Iraq War, the \n\n220  Miguel Otero-Iglesias\nGlobal Financial Crisis, the Great Recession and its socioeconomic effects, the four \nyears of Trump in the White House, including his mishandling of the pandemic \nand the rejection of the Global South to follow the US lead in sanctioning Russia) \nhas dented US hegemony and has pushed the Western-led liberal order to precari -\nous state. The power shifts in the digital sphere covered in this chapter have just \nreflected, and to some extent accelerated, this deeper structural evolution. Indeed, \nas mentioned before, instabilities can be triggered not only by the rising power but \nalso by the declining one ( Kirshner, 2021 ).\nWhether these structural changes are enough to transform the world\u2019s dominant \nbeliefs system, or in other words, the rules and norms of the international order, \nso that we can talk of a true revolution, is perhaps too soon to tell. The jury is still \nout on it. Nonetheless, there are certain signals that point in this direction. The bal -\nance between how much influence the market and how much the state should have \nseems to be tilting back in favour of the latter. If the third industrial revolution, \nthat of the computer and internet, triggered the neoliberal era of individualism, \nthe fourth, based on digital innovation and artificial intelligence, might bring a \nmore collectivist age. In certain regions this will strengthen authoritarian regimes \n(especially in Asia and Africa), in others it will empower illiberal democracies \nlike Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary, and in others, including the United States and the European \nUnion, it will bring a more active state in the workings of the economy. This \ncomes with its dangers. Already there are more non-democracies than democra -\ncies in the world, and the support for democracy is dropping even in some estab -\nlished democracies ( Freedom House, 2021 ). In the West this has triggered alarms \nand has led to the realisation that if domestic tensions are not addressed, it will be \ndifficult to compete with the Chinese model, which, according to Angus Deaton \n(2021 ), has managed the COVID-19 pandemic well despite the social costs of the \nlockdowns.\nThese changes have favoured increased geopolitical tensions between the \nUnited States and China, and the digital sphere will perhaps be the most important \nbattle ground. It is likely that in the next years, the United States and China will \nbuild two different digital ecosystems, which will affect all four power structures, \nand will become very zealous of how much their rival is able to penetrate their \nown domestic ecosystem. Xi Jinping has already talked about a dual circulation, \nwhich differentiates clearly between the Chinese market and the rest of the world. \nJoe Biden has also embraced the \u2018Buy American\u2019 spirit and signalled that it will \ncontinue to have a tough stand towards China with export controls and even the \nbanning of Chinese tech and media outlets in the American market. For the Euro -\npean Union and the rest of the regions and countries in the world, this emerg -\ning \u2018Tech Cold War\u2019 will be difficult to manage. US pressure to not use Chinese \ntech in the 5G networks is just the first of many trade-offs. The European Union \naspires to develop a third power pole and increase its strategic autonomy in all \nfour structures of power. By doing so it would update the European model, more \nfocused on justice than security or freedom, and therefore a more regulated and \nethical, in other words, a more embedded liberalism, for the digital age. Whether \n\nInternational Political Economy of the Digital (Revolution)  221\nEuropean artificial intelligence capabilities can compete with the American and \nChinese ones is still to be seen; either way, it appears that we are at the dawn of a \ndigital revolution in the international political economy with more states and less \nmarkets.\nReferences\nAcemoglu, D.,  & Robinson, J.

Social media \u2018provide a voice to the voice -\nless\u2019 (Gerbaudo, 2018, p.  746), so that hitherto unprecedented numbers of people \ncan express themselves publicly and reach large crowds. This fundamental change \nhas had an impact on politics. Social media helped revolutionaries organise them -\nselves in authoritarian regimes (Jurgenson, 2012; Ratto  & Boler, 2014; Tufekci, \n2013), authoritarian regimes themselves have changed their messaging strategies \nand no longer fully rely on controlling public opinion (Deibert, Rohozinski,  & \nCrete-Nishihata, 2012; Gunitsky, 2015), and social media have contributed to the \nrise of populist movements (Adler  & Drieschova, 2021).\nThis chapter addresses the question whether the increasing usage of social \nmedia has also led to a change in the climate change discourse in the North Atlantic \nregion. Two new kinds of actors in particular could gain leverage with the erosion \nof traditional gatekeepers: populist climate sceptics on the one hand, and broad-\nbased mass social movements seeking radical change to address global warming on \nthe other hand. The chapter analyses the strategies these two groups of actors have \ndeployed on social media to raise awareness for their cause.\nWhile in theory anybody can reach large crowds on social media, only a small \npercentage of people actually do (Anger  & Kittl, 2011). Messages spread widely \nif they get shared, liked, retweeted frequently. They need to provoke a reaction \nin their audience that leads the audience to actively respond to the messages, be \nit only with a mouse click. Social media provide specific affordances, concrete 9\nTHE SOCIAL MEDIA REVOLUTION  \nAND SHIFTS IN THE CLIMATE  \nCHANGE DISCOURSE\nAlena Drieschova\n\n228  Alena Drieschova\npossibilities for action, that users need to seize upon in order to disseminate mes -\nsages widely. Some users automatically have a large followership as a result of \ntheir offline position in the real world, others gain attention capital through their \nsocial media presence and become networked microcelebrities. They can use this \ncapital to advocate for specific causes.\nUsers who succeed in generating emotionally arousing content provoke faster \nresponses and thus larger followership. Creating content that others can relate to \nand potentially adapt to have it shape their own online identity matters as well. \nThis can be achieved through memes, imagery and videos that can be modified \nto provide an outlet for personal expression and creative and witty play. The indi -\nvidualisation goes hand in glove with a community forming dimension. Social \nmedia permit the lonely crowds to gather in the virtual space, express shared alle -\ngiance, and form a collective. Coordinated activities become cheaper, faster and \neasier. Successful social media usage generates a logic of connective action that \nreplaces the traditional logic of collective action (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012). In a \nlogic of connective action individualised and personal expressions matter over the \nexpression of the collective; messages spread among peers in a horizontal network \nstructure.\nClimate sceptics have so far been unable to harness the affordances social media \nprovide effectively and generate a logic of connective action. The most popular \nclimate sceptic accounts have not obtained more than 50,000 followers; their best \nposts receive a few hundred likes. By contrast, Greta Thunberg has 10.5  million \nfollowers on Instagram, 4.4  million followers on Twitter, and her posts obtain thou -\nsands of likes. These observations are in line with earlier quantitative studies on \nTwitter, which found that climate sceptic hashtags like agw and climaterealists \nwere included in 1.4% of climate change Tweets, whereas 97.7% of the collected \ntweets contained the hashtags climate, climate change and global warming (Wil -\nliams, McMurray, Kurz,  & Lambert, 2015).\nIt is quite surprising that climate sceptics generate very little user engagement \non the main social media sites, notably Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, given that \npopulists, with whom climate sceptics are closely affiliated, have been extraordi -\nnarily effective in social media mobilisation.1 Yet climate sceptics have relied in \ntheir social media strategy primarily on imitating the scientific discourse, which \nhas not resulted in large levels of social media popularity, although this strategy has \nbeen previously successful for climate sceptics to obtain a hearing in legacy media \noutlets, notably in Anglophone countries. We could potentially see an increase of \nclimate sceptic voices on social media in the future, as part of larger populist dis -\ncourses, but so far climate scepticism has not plaid a prominent role in populist \nsocial media presence.\nBy contrast, the climate strike movement has been highly successful on social \nmedia, and one person, namely Greta Thunberg, particularly so. She has been able \nto use her youth, her vulnerability, and her emotionality coupled with a peculiar \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  229\naesthetics that highlights the ordinariness, the everyday, and the unimportance of \nher persona to convey the message that even the least powerful person can make a \nsignificant contribution to combatting global warming. We see here a paradoxical \nphenomenon that digitisation cannot just lead to the empowerment of tech savvy \nindividuals (see Giacomello and Eriksson, this volume), but also to the empower -\nment of relatively vulnerable people with minimal technological knowledge and \nskills. Greta Thunberg is the most prominent, but by far not the only young woman \nwho has been able to utilise her vulnerability, combined with a specific aesthetics \nand emotionality to generate social media user engagement, become a networked \nmicro-celebrity (Tufekci, 2013), and use this position to advocate for major politi -\ncal change. Thunberg\u2019s specific personal style is quite unique though and has so \nfar not been imitated by any of the other microcelebrities in the climate strike \nmovement.\nThe mainstream climate change discourse has followed the geophysical sciences \nand portrayed climate change as a universal, predictable, apolitical and precisely \nmeasurable phenomenon that can be reduced to temperature increases to quantify \nit, and CO2 emissions to combat it. This mainstream discourse remains intact in \nmany regards, and the climate strike movement has not sought to fundamentally \nundermine it. Yet, the movement has succeeded in shifting the discourse slightly \nalong three major lines. First, the movement has highlighted the urgency of the \nproblem and framed it in terms of a climate crisis that requires radical and uncom -\npromising action. Second, it has introduced a significant normative dimension to \nthe debate and emphasises the importance of intergenerational responsibility that \nparents hold towards their children. Third, the climate strike movement has shown \nthat the problem is not so big that only the entire globe can solve it in a concerted \neffort or not at all, but that every individual carries responsibility and can provoke \nchange in his/her everyday acts, not just as a consumer, but as an active and politi -\ncal citizen. Political elites in the European Union are seizing upon the momentum \nthat has been established and are using it, discursively, as well as politically, to \nadvocate for changes in climate policies. Their discursive support further feeds into \nthe movement\u2019s legitimacy.\nWe can see herein that social media has changed agential processes (see Bjola  & \nKornprobst in the introduction of this book). Social media are digital technologies \nthat are changing \u2018the ontological foundations of agency\u2019 (Ibid.), which, in turn, \nhave shifted the background ordering layers on which the climate change regime \nrests. First, because of their speed and pervasiveness, social media have empow -\nered new kinds of actors, who had previously been more marginal. Second, social \nmedia have led to a change in successful messaging strategies from what used to \nbe common previously. Technology has impacted mechanisms of \u2018winning over\u2019, \nthat is the discursive strategies that have the potential to convince other actors \nof what the right thing to do is, and thus shape societal discourse more gener -\nally. Through these changes the distribution of power in the climate change order \n\n230  Alena Drieschova\nhas shifted. Social movements advocating for urgent climate change action have \nbecome more powerful, and they have supported a discursive shift that promotes \nmore radical and immediate climate action. There is a real potential for the order \nitself to change, and hence for the policies that get adopted in that order to change \nas well. Social media are a source of digital disruption that, for now, appears to be \npositively impacting climate change mitigation efforts. Yet, as with any source of \ndisruption the ultimate outcome is unpredictable, and positive trends might well be \nreversed in the future.\nThe chapter first highlights the specific action potentials social media provide \nthat allow for a wide dissemination of messages online. The next section describes \nthe mainstream climate change discourse, which the climate strike movement \nas well as climate sceptics seek to challenge. Third I  provide an overview of the \nfindings from previous studies, mainly quantitative studies on Twitter, of how cli -\nmate change has been tackled in social media. From these studies, it appears that \nthe overwhelming majority of social media posts imitate the mainstream climate \nchange discourse. The fourth section explains the methodology I  used for this \nstudy, which is a qualitative study of individual accounts of climate sceptics and \nthe climate strike movement on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. The last section \nhighlights the differences in the approaches to social media communication the two \nmovements have adopted.\nSocial Media Affordances, Microcelebrities and the Logic \nof\u00a0Connective Action\nSocial media disruption can change which agents become meaningful in shaping \nsocietal discourses, and how those agents can change the discourses. Social media \nare digital technologies that can influence actors\u2019 strategies of winning over, or \nselect out specific strategies of winning over, which will then impact the background \nordering layers. Social media hold specific affordances, that is they \u2018enable[s] and \nconstrain[s] the tasks users can possibly perform with\u2019 them (Adler-Nissen  & Dri -\neschova, 2019, p.  531). Affordances highlight the action potentials that are inherent \nin technologies. Technologies can be used in multiple ways, and users can come up \nwith new ways of using technologies, of which the technologies\u2019 designers have \nnot previously thought. Yet, these possibilities have to be inherent in the technolo -\ngies (Evans, Pearce, Vitak,  & Treem, 2017). To determine the particular societal \neffects a technology will have, it is therefore key to study the technology in the \nsocial environment into which it is located. What matters is the interaction between \npeople and the technologies they use, a phenomenon Orilikowski, Yates, Okamura, \nand Fujimoto (1995) have termed \u2018technology-in-use\u2019.\nFrom an affordances perspective, social media have several characteristics that \nhitherto marginalised actors can seize upon to enhance their visibility. Most impor -\ntantly, of course, social media significantly decrease the costs for circulating mes -\nsages, as they allow individuals and groups to sidestep legacy media when seeking \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  231\nto communicate with a larger audience (Gurevitch, Coleman,  & Blumler, 2009, \np. 168; Pearce, Niederer, Oezkula,  & Sanchez Querubin, 2018, p.  1) The barriers \nfor participating in debates in the public sphere have been significantly lowered. \nA large portion of the population obtains their news from social media (in the \nUnited States between 47% and 62% according to opinion polls) (Shearer, 2017; \nSilverman, 2016), so messages circulated through this means of communication \nhave the potential to spread widely, they are pervasive, and they can easily and at \nhigh speed travel across national boundaries as well.\nSocial media are platforms designed for the free flow of messages, where algo -\nrithms favour those messages that obtain speedy reactions in the form of shar -\ning, liking and commenting. The gatekeeping role traditional media performed \nin terms of checking in on the accuracy of messages in line with the ideals of \njournalism risks eroding. With hindsight, social media platforms are increasingly \nmonitoring the content on their sites and at times blocking specific accounts. \nHowever, these appear ad hoc, and not yet fully systematised activities that are \nnot fundamentally undermining the primary logic of requiring quick and frequent \nreactions on messages to ensure their wide spread, even as these activities raise \nthorny questions about free speech and the regulation of social media sites. It \nremains true that \u2018timeline algorithms tend to favour instantly popular content \u2013 \nthose posts that attract a high number of reactions in the few seconds and minutes \nsince their publication\u2019 (Gerbuado, 2018, p.  751). Users who have more follow -\ners, that is users who are more famous for one reason or another, will have their \nposts seen by a larger number of people, and therefore a larger number of people \nis likely to react to them (Duncombe, 2019, p.  413). Yet, this basic rule can be \ncounteracted as well.\nSome people have become famous because of their social media presence, not \nvice versa. In an attention economy, they have succeeded to garner sufficiently \nmany followers to acquire the respective capital and become influential. Net -\nworked microcelebrities can use the popularity they obtain on social media to pro -\nmote specific causes.\nNetworked microcelebrity activism refers to politically motivated non-  \ninstitutional actors who use affordances of social media to engage in presenta -\ntion of their political and personal selves to garner public attention to their cause, \nusually through a combination of testimony, advocacy, and citizen journalism.\n(Tufekci, 2013, p.  850)\nThese microcelebrities gain a high status on social media by managing its affor -\ndances effectively, measurable in the number of followers they have. In a positive \nloophole effect, mass media appearances, granted to micro-celebrities because of \ntheir high followers, further increase their followership. Tufekci studies activists \nwho contributed to the toppling of authoritarian regimes. Yet, her definition of \nmicrocelebrities can be adapted to apply to populist and far-right actors as well. \n\n232  Alena Drieschova\nThus, next to tech-savvy individuals (Giacomello and Eriksson, this volume), states \nand big tech corporations (Baines, this volume), digital technologies can unexpect -\nedly empower individuals, who had been comparatively marginalised previously. \nThese individuals and movements are becoming important actors in cyberspace.\nWhat makes these actors powerful is their ability to generate content that is \nemotionally arousing and provokes fast responses. Especially negative affect plays \na key role in speedy dissemination (Veltri  & Atanasova, 2017, p.  724). The impor -\ntance of propagating emotionally arousing content to ensure its wide spread has \nbeen underlined by a 2018 study, which evaluated all news stories on Twitter since \nthe site\u2019s launch, and concluded that false news stories disseminate significantly \nmore quickly and widely than accurate news stories. The same study also found \nthat these news stories provoked emotional responses of \u2018fear disgust and surprise\u2019 \n(V osoughi, Roy,  & Aral, 2018, p.  1146). Fake news can be more sensationalist and \nmight even get fabricated with the purpose to elicit emotional reactions and there -\nfore disseminate more widely on social media.\nAnother affordance of social media is that they provide an online space for \nthe \u2018lonely crowds\u2019 to gather and create a virtual community (Gerbaudo, 2018, \np. 750). Dispersed individuals can meet and organise in cyberspace (Van den \nBulck  & Hyzen, 2020). In this virtual space they can orchestrate collective actions \nand become politically active (Farrell, 2012). The Alt-right for example regularly \nengages in trolling tactics online and selects specific targets, like celebrities, or a \ncomputer game to collectively attack them using the #hashtag and reposting func -\ntions (Duncombe, 2019). Social movements can deploy these functions to raise \ngeneral awareness about specific issues. The opportunity costs in this virtual space \nare not as high. People can post, comment, and like from the comfort of their living \nroom with the press of a button. They are not required to spend days outside poten -\ntially in adverse weather conditions (Bakardjieva, 2015, p.  985), risking arrest or \nphysical harm, although it is worth noting that combining online and offline pres -\nence can be highly effective. Thus many social media microcelebrities in the Arab \nspring gained their status by reporting about and in the midst of highly personally \ncharged situations (Tufekci, 2013).\nAt the same time, social media are based on user personalisation. This means \nthat they afford individual users fast and cheap ways to develop and curate their \nonline identity, express themselves, and get involved. Users can change their pro -\nfile pictures and convey their allegiance to a particular community or cause within \nseconds, although they can just as quickly reverse the act (Gerbaudo, 2015). This \npersonal identity-forming dimension, and its reinforcement through positive feed -\nback, keeps users engaged.\nSocial media\u2019s affordances to diffuse, manipulate and individualise imagery \nand video further enhance the curation of personal online identities. While pho -\ntographs have always been important for expressing broader universal conditions \nthrough specifically tangible individual circumstances, social media afford to \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  233\ncirculate infinite variations of the same image and thus individualise it and adapt \nit to specific circumstances. In this sense, they also serve as an outlet for creativ -\nity. It is possible to make cartoons of the image, use reaction photoshop and add \nthings to the original image, place elements from the original image into a new \ncontext, or re-enact the image with different people posing like the composition \nof the original photograph (Olesen, 2018). Individuals can publicly display their \nown personal engagement and forms of self-expression and thus develop owner -\nship over the messages they emit. The performance of the individual\u2019s self is key. \nSocial media afford this personalisation, so that individuals can filter their partici -\npation in specific movements through their lifestyles and forms of self-expression. \nWhen organisations and movements afford more room for the personalisation of \nthe key messages, they experience higher levels of user engagement (Bennett  & \nSegerberg, 2011).\nSocial media are the ideal environment for the spread of memes. A  meme is\na symbolic packet that travels easily across large and diverse populations because \nit is easy to imitate, adapt personally, and share broadly with others. Memes are \nnetwork building and bridging units of social information transmission similar \nto genes in the biological sphere (Dawkins, 1989). They travel through personal \nappropriation, and then by imitation and personalized expression via social shar -\ning in ways that help others appropriate, imitate, and share in turn.\n(Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012, p.  745)\nMemes are the perfect tools in the social media environment to express group \ncohesion, while simultaneously allowing for individual expression through the \nuse of imagery that provokes fast reactions, and therefore ensures widespread \ndissemination.\nIf collective activities on social media become successful and use these affor -\ndances effectively, they generate a logic of connective action that is distinct from \nthe typical logic of collective action (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012). In a logic of \nconnective action information spreads in peer-to-peer networks through personal \nsharing among friends. \u2018Group ties are being replaced by large-scale, fluid social \nnetworks\u2019 (Bennett  & Segerberg, 2012, p.  748). Hierarchical organisational struc -\ntures matter significantly less. People maintain their own personal identities and \nexpress allegiance to different causes, but without establishing a collective iden -\ntity with others (Papacharissi, 2016). The politics of identity gets replaced with a \n\u2018politics of visibility\u2019 that generates \u2018individuals-in-the-group\u2019, rather than societal \ncollectives (Milan, 2015). Through these dynamics established societal discourses \ncan get disrupted, but it is significantly less clear whether these disruptions will \nlead to long-lasting change. They first of all introduce alternative viewpoints. The \npower these networks generate is of a transient nature, and they can dismantle as \nquickly as they emerged.\n\n234  Alena Drieschova\nThe logic of connective action differs from the other logics of action IR scholars \nhave introduced into the discipline. The logic of consequences suggests that peo -\nple\u2019s actions are based on means-ends calculations; the logic of appropriateness \n(March  & Olsen, 1998) indicates that people act in line with socially recognised \nmoral standards and norms; the logic of arguing (Risse, 2000) is based on reason-\nbased argumentation and collective discussions, in which the better argument leads \nthe way; the logic of practicality focuses on subconscious and embodied ways of \nacting (Pouliot, 2008). Different from all of these logics, the logic of connective \naction depends on a specific technology, and it functions only through the medium \nof that technology. It is a performative logic based on self-presentation and external \nrecognition of that self-presentation, that then spreads non-hierarchically through \ndifferent nodal points in a network and gets adapted and modified in the process \nto allow for self-presentation and external recognition of that self-presentation \nin every step along the way. The collective discourse emerges in a decentralised \nmechanism through the sum and spread of these instances of self-presentation and \ntheir external recognition. While each of the four logics of action identified in IR \ncan be part of the logic of connective action, the logic of connective action is irre -\nducible to these other logics.\nSocial media have already left a mark on the structure of societal discourses. To \nsome extent digital technology has disrupted social orders by shaping mechanisms \nof \u2018winning over\u2019, that is mechanisms of how societal discourses develop. Social \nmedia have notably led to more emotionally charged messaging and less rational -\nised argumentation. This feature, combines with individualised news feeds, that \nare resulting in an erosion of societally shared knowledge and social consensus \n(Adler  & Drieschova, 2021). The consequence is polarised discursive communities \namong which there is little interaction, and less interaction is becoming possible.\nThe analysis below demonstrates that this mechanism also partly occurs in the \nrealm of climate change. There is very little interaction between climate activists \nand climate sceptics online; people within these communities tend to converse with \nlike-minded peers. At the same time, however, there is a very strong consensus \nabout the reality of climate change on social media and an expressed urgency to \naddress it. Climate activists have been markedly more able to seize the affordances \nof social media to their advantage than climate sceptics. Climate activists have also \nbeen able to steer the discourse in a direction of more emotionality, more engage -\nment and a higher degree of urgency. They have thus impacted the background \nlayer of the climate change order.\nWhile social media share a set number of common characteristics, it is also \nworth noting that each platform provides slightly different affordances, and a some -\nwhat different user culture animates each platform, which impacts the ways the \nplatform works and on the kind of content that gets shared on it (Pearce, Niederer, \nOezkula,  & Sanchez Querubin, 2018, p.  2). Dissimilar platforms can for example \ngive preference to distinct kinds of imagery. Thus, Instagram is known for aestheti -\ncally appealing photographs, whereas Tumblr users preferentially post screenshots, \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  235\nmemes and GIFs. Observations from one platform can therefore not simply be \nextrapolated to other platforms, and it is also worth studying how these platforms \ninteract with each other (Poell, 2014, p.  728). Social science scholars have focused \ntheir analyses on Twitter, because of Twitter\u2019s easy and transparent access policies, \nand the simplicity with which Twitter\u2019s textual content can be analysed quantita -\ntively. Yet, Twitter is far from being the most popular social media site (317  mil-\nlion users), compared to Facebook (1,871  million users), YouTube (1,000  million \nusers), Qzone (632  million users) or Instagram (600  million users) (Kemp, 2017 in \nPearce et  al., 2018, p.  3).\nThe Mainstream Climate Change Discourse\nPrior to the widespread use of social media, policy actors, natural scientists, econo -\nmists, international organisations and NGOs had primarily influenced the climate \nchange discourse (Allan, 2018; Bernstein, 2002; Litfin, 2000; Mitchell, 2013). Leg -\nacy media in most developed countries followed the discourse these actors insti -\ntuted and reported on climate change primarily when natural disasters occurred, \nmajor international conferences took place, or important reports were published. \nThis mainstream climate change discourse was established along universalising \nscientific and apolitical lines (Jasanoff, 2010; Methmann, 2013).\nClimate change as a phenomenon has been examined primarily as a geophysical \noccurrence, rather than as a biological, ecological and/or complex phenomenon. \nThe US military provided financial support mostly to the geophysical sciences in \nthe 1950s to study the climate in order to manipulate it (Allan, 2017a). This ensured \nthat the geophysical sciences progressed more rapidly in climate change studies \nthan other natural sciences, like biology or ecology. The geophysical sciences \nhence provided the discursive framework that shaped the understanding of climate \nchange, and they portrayed a \u2018gradualist, determinist, and predictable image of the \nclimate\u2019 (Allan, 2017a, p.  132). By contrast, other scientific approaches character -\nise the climate as \u2018nonlinear, indefinite, and volatile\u2019 (Allan, 2017a, p.  132). In a \ngeophysical framework, the highly complex phenomenon of climate change has \nbeen reduced to the measurable figure of CO2 with the understanding that if CO2 \nlevels are controlled, it is possible to precisely influence the climate (L\u00f6vbrand, \nStripple,  & Wiman, 2009; Weingart, Engels,  & Pansegrau, 2000).\nThe geophysical conception of the climate links up well with neoclassical eco -\nnomic models that equally promise controlling supply and demand on a market via \nthe pricing mechanism (Allan, 2017b, p.  153). From 1972 onwards there has been \na gradual convergence of norms of environmental protection and economic liber -\nalism; Bernstein termed this nexus \u2018liberal environmentalism\u2019 (Bernstein, 2002). \nFrom the UN conference in Rio in 1992 onwards solutions to addressing climate \nchange have been framed in terms of sustainable development. The principle of \nsustainable development, which formed a cornerstone of the climate change mitiga -\ntion discourse emerged as a compromise solution between the North and the South, \n\n236  Alena Drieschova\npartly because the South did not want to forgo its opportunity for development \n(Bernstein, 2002; Mitchell, 2013). The primary focus was on ensuring economic \ngrowth, and economic growth and environmental protection have been conceived \nin zero-sum terms (Meckling  & Allan, 2020). To address climate change policies \nsought to identify mechanisms to reduce CO2 on the basis of market principles, not \nthrough restrictive regulatory measures, as market mechanisms were thought to be \ncheaper (Flottum  & Gjerstad, 2017).\nFollowing the 2008 financial crisis, the discourse changed and moved from sus -\ntainable development as its cornerstone to the notion of \u2018green growth\u2019. Scientific \nresearch has made it increasingly obvious that climate change is a reality and will \nnecessitate widespread measures to mitigate it. At the same time the financial crisis \nrequired policies that enhance economic growth. Green growth suggests that envi -\nronmental protection and economic growth are compatible, if economic growth is \nsteered in the right direction with the help of state intervention and specific regula -\ntions (Meckling  & Allan, 2020, p.  434).\nThere has been one significant exception to this general discourse, primarily \nstemming from conservative think tanks and fossil fuel lobbies in the United States \nwho sponsored contrarian scientists to sow uncertainty by challenging the findings \nof scientific researchers and questioning the occurrence of climate change, or its \nanthropogenic nature (Austin, 2002; Boussalis  & Coan, 2015; Jacques, Dunlap,  & \nFreeman, 2009; McCright  & Dunlap, 2003; Oreskes, 2004; Pollack, 2003). This \ncounter-discourse has been remarkably successful in the United States in particu -\nlar, although to some extent also in the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada, \nbut less so in other liberal democracies (Carvalho, 2005; Dispensa  & Brulle, 2003; \nKaiser  & Puschmann, 2017; McManus, 2000). It has been promoted by legacy \nmedia and even wire and news service providers (Antilla, 2005), who in an effort to \nprovide balanced reporting allocated more space to climate sceptics than scientific \nfindings would warrant (Boykoff  & Boykoff, 2004; Harvey et  al., 2018; Lewan -\ndowsky, Gignac,  & Vaughan, 2013; Oreskes  & Conway, 2010). They thus created \nan image of scientific controversy that has confused the public about the reality of \nclimate change (Antilla, 2005; Carvalho, 2007; Zehr, 2000).\nProbably for that reason there is a \u2018consensus gap\u2019 between the overwhelming \nagreement of the scientific community that climate change is happening, that it is \nman-made, and that it will cause serious difficulties for our societies in the fore -\nseeable future if nothing is done to mitigate it, and the general public opinion in \nthe United States, which remains mostly unconvinced of climate change (Dunlap, \n2013; Harvey et  al., 2018). For example, only 36% of Americans believe that cli -\nmate change is a serious concern, and only 48% that it is anthropogenic (Roxburgh \net al., 2019). It is difficult for citizens to comprehend long-term trends that effect \nvery large stretches of territory, but only have a small impact on people\u2019s day-\nto-day lives in the present (Wilson, 2000). All the more populations rely on the \nmedia to portray climate change to them. The artificial sanctioning of fringe views \nabout climate change in US media has fuelled the climate change scepticism in the \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  237\nAmerican population and legitimised inaction in the face of climate change. The \nUnited States\u2019 reluctance to adopt mitigation policies and adhere to international \ntreaties has been directly linked to the prevalence of the climate sceptic discourse \n(Antilla, 2005; Boykoff  & Boykoff, 2004; Jacques et  al., 2009).\nPast research demonstrates that prior to the onset of social media NGOs as \nwell as climate sceptics have already been quite successful in shaping the climate \nchange discourse (Allan, 2020; Haas, 1992; Raustiala, 1997). NGOs were very \nsuccessful at the international institutional level, which has been to some extent \nremoved from domestic political pressures (Litfin, 2000; Mitchell, 2013). By con -\ntrast, climate sceptics operated through domestic politics, notably in the United \nStates to sow confusion. The question now is whether through social media, broad-\nbased social movements can influence the climate change discourse, and secondly \nclimate sceptics can have even more power than they have had hitherto.\nAn Overview of Climate Change Discussions on Social Media\nClimate change is a popular topic on social media. A  Pew Research Centre study \ndemonstrates that sometimes climate change and global warming are among the \ntop five keywords on all English-language blogs and in all tweets (Schaefer, 2012, \np. 532). By contrast, ordinary citizens seem to be less engaged in climate change \ntopics than they are on average on social media. Following opinion polls, 7% of \nAmerican respondents share content related to climate change on social media, \nand 6% have commented on another post (Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, \nFeinberg,  & Howe, 2013). Although citizens are in general not very involved in \nclimate change-related matters (Anderson  & Huntington, 2017), ordinary citizens\u2019 \nonline conversations about climate change occur less frequently than their offline \nengagement; 35% of US respondents said they occasionally discuss global warm -\ning with relatives and friends (Leiserowitz, Maibach, Roser-Renouf, Feinburg,  & \nRosenthal, 2015; Anderson, 2017, p.  5). Thus, while climate change is a popular \ntopic on social media, it is less captivating for ordinary citizens, perhaps due to the \nscientific nature of the conversation that takes place online.\nThe overwhelming majority of studies that analyse how climate change has \nbeen represented in social media thus far are quantitative analyses focusing on \nTwitter. Overall legacy media strongly dominate the climate change discussions \non Twitter, and those discussions follow the mainstream scientific climate change \ndiscourse. For example, in conjunction with the 2013 IPCC report, the most fre -\nquently occurring domain names on Twitter were from mainstream media (35%), \nnew media (23%), science news (20%), governments or academia (12%) and \nadvocacy groups (9%) (Newman, 2017). Furthermore, around 50% of climate \nchange-related retweets are retweeting 0.4% of users, primarily mainstream media \noutlets (Kirilenko  & Stepchenkova, 2014). Most web links in climate change \ntweets (67%) also refer to mainstream media, while 9% reference NGOs, and 8% \nnon- professional blogs (V eltri & Atanasova, 2017, p. 733; see also Poell, 2014). \n\n238  Alena Drieschova\nClimate sceptic blogs such as Watts Up With That and Climate Depot were each \nlinked to 0.2% of climate change Tweets (Kirilenko  & Stepchenkova, 2014). Yet, \namong the 100 most retweeted posts mentioning the 2013 IPCC report 35% came \nfrom non-elite users, and 17% from mainstream media. The top five tweets most \nfrequently retweeted all came from elite users though, and the retweeting network \nwas highly skewed towards the top (Newman, 2017). The data suggests that while \nmainstream media are the most influential tweeters, other users can garner atten -\ntion on social media (Pearce et  al., 2018).\nThe content of tweets is in line with this general user and retweeting pattern. \nVeltri and Atanasova (2017) found that 78% of the tweets related to climate change \nwere of a descriptive nature, and 22% called for action. Accordingly, most tweets \nhad a neutral tone, followed by an equal amount of positive and negative tweets. \nSimilarly, Anderson and Huntington (2017) found that climate change tweets con -\ntained low levels of incivility and sarcasm (around 3%), which were expressed \nmainly by ultra-right users.\nThe qualitative analysis of climate sceptics on social media I  conducted \nbetween September  2020 and January  2021 confirms previous quantitative studies \nthat highlight the low success rate of climate sceptics in terms of user engagement \non social media. The rather low performance of climate sceptics on social media \nis surprising, and goes against the overall trend of the ultra-right\u2019s and populists\u2019 \nsuccess on social media, especially when compared to more mainstream political \nparties and movements (Adler  & Drieschova, 2021). One partial explanation for \nthis discrepancy could be that climate sceptics use a different set of hashtags and \nmainly congregate around the hashtags climaterealists and agw (Anderson, 2017, \np. 9; Williams et  al., 2015).2 Studies of climate change on Twitter might thus not \ncapture their tweets, if those studies concentrate on more general hashtags like cli -\nmatechange or global-warming. Yet, one study looked at the hashtags agw and cli -\nmaterealists, which climate sceptics employ, alongside the hashtags climatechange \nand globalwarming, and found that climate sceptics have a significantly lower \nreach than \u2018activists\u2019 (Williams et  al., 2015). The same study also found that a few \nactivists had a very large number of followers, whereas the number of followers \nwas more evenly distributed among sceptics (Williams et  al., 2015, p.  134). Of the \ntotal number of tweets collected in the study, 97.7% contained the hashtags cli -\nmate, climatechange, and globalwarming. In another study, the same authors found \nthat #agw accounted for 1.4% of collected climate change tweets, and #climatere -\nalists effectively seized being used (Williams et  al., 2015). The study confirms that \nclimate sceptics are not significantly influencing the climate change discourse on \nTwitter. Occasionally, in conjunction with specific events, such as extreme cold \nweather spills, or scandals, like the Climategate scandal, climate sceptic sources \ncan experience a temporary spike in their popularity (Hollin  & Pearce, 2015; Med-\nhaug, Stolpe, Fischer,  & Knutti, 2017; Roberts, Palmer, McNeall,  & Collins, 2015; \nRoxburgh et  al., 2019), otherwise the mainstream climate change discourse domi -\nnates Twitter. Surprisingly, on Twitter, there is less climate change scepticism, and \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  239\nmore acknowledgement of the scientific consensus on climate change than in the \nmass media in the United States and the United Kingdom (Loercher  & Taddicken, \n2017; O\u2019Neill, Williams, Kurz, Wiersma,  & Boykoff, 2015).\nYet, climate sceptics are comparatively successful in the blogosphere. The cli -\nmate sceptical blog WattsUpWithThat.com for example has been nominated as the \n\u2018Best Weblog of the Year\u2019 in 2013, and the \u2018Best Science Blog\u2019 three times in a row \n(Elgesem, Steskal,  & Diakopoulos, 2015), until the \u2018Bloggies\u2019 discontinued the sci -\nence category in 2014, and the weblog awards themselves ended in 2015. Climate \nsceptic blogs have many visitors (around 300,000 per month) and are among the \nmost popular blogs on climate change (Harvey et  al., 2018; Schaefer, 2012). It is \nworth noting though that only around 7% of the population in the United States \nuses blogs (Dautrich  & Barnes, 2005; Sharman, 2014). The major social media \nsites are significantly more popular. As I  demonstrate later, climate sceptics have \neven lesser numbers of followers, shares, and likes on Facebook and Instagram \nthan they have on Twitter. And alternative social media sites, such as 4Chan, Gab \nor Parler, have comparatively low user numbers.\nMethodology\nThe chapter\u2019s focus is on those actors, who are typically marginalised in mass \nbroadcasting media environments and acquire opportunities to voice themselves in \nthe social media world. Given that social media are highly decentralised and infor -\nmal, they provide new opportunities in particular for individuals and grassroots \nsocial movements, which function outside of the political mainstream (Castells, \n2004; Kaiser  & Puschmann, 2017). In addressing the question of whether social \nmedia have led to a change in the climate change discourse, the analysis focuses \non these actors. I  have therefore not studied the social media strategies of interna -\ntional organisations, government officials and institutions, legacy media, scientists \nand scientific institutions or traditional NGOs. Instead, I  concentrated on not fully \ninstitutionalised social movements and on individual users in their positions as \nordinary citizens.\nThe study compares climate sceptics\u2019 social media strategy with the climate \nstrike\u2019s social media strategy through a netnography (Costello, McDermott,  & Wal -\nlace, 2017). Given that most existing analyses of climate change in social media \nhave focused on Twitter and been text-based quantitative analyses of Big Data, \nI have headed Pearce et al.\u2019s (2018, p.  1) advice, namely to \u2018consider qualitative \nstudies, visual communication and alternative social media platforms to Twitter\u2019. \nNotably, I  focus the analysis on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, and on the inter -\naction between these sites. I  picked these three sites, because they are among the \nmost popular social media sites in Western democracies with the largest numbers of \nactive monthly users, namely 2.96  billion for Facebook, one billion for Instagram \nand 450  million for Twitter. These sites have thus the largest likelihood of influ -\nencing the mainstream climate change discourse in liberal democracies. Tik-tok\u2019s \n\n240  Alena Drieschova\nnumber of users has dramatically increased to one billion, but its user numbers had \nnot been as high when I  conducted the empirical research for this chapter.\nI study texts as well as imagery. Studying the imagery of climate change on \nsocial media represents an empirical contribution, as the overwhelming majority of \navailable studies do not account for imagery. Yet, imagery is especially important \nfor provoking emotional reactions, and generating general appeal. How imagery \ngets used, how it is transformed, and how it circulates matters for the widespread \ndissemination of messages, perhaps more than the text itself.\nDifferent from most social media studies, which retrieve messages that contain \nspecific hashtags, I  have decided to follow individual user profiles to identify the \nsocial media strategies of specific users and their effectiveness. One individual, \nwho is unlikely to have ever made the cut in a traditional broadcasting environ -\nment, stands out. Greta Thunberg was a 15-year-old teenager when she began going \non school strikes to save the climate in August  2018. Her notoriety for addressing \nclimate change appeared on social media first of all, but two years later she is co-\nleading a wide social movement that has stepped out of the virtual on-screen world \ninto real life. Her social media presence by far outperforms the social media pres -\nence of all climate sceptics combined. Greta Thunberg is also not the only female \nclimate activist with a strong social media presence. She has been preceded as well \nas followed by numerous others, such as Luisa Neubauer, Xiye Bastida, Jamie \nMargolin and Alexandria Villase\u00f1or.\nSecond, I  focused on a set number of climate sceptics. Picking the right climate \nsceptics was significantly less obvious, as they do not carry the same degree of \nnotoriety. I  selected climate sceptics on the basis of a secondary literature analysis, \nwhich has primarily mapped climate sceptic blogs (Metcalfe, 2020; Reed, 2016; \nSchmid-Petri, 2017; Sharman, 2014). Some of these blog owners also appear on \nsocial media, notably Twitter. I  manually scrolled through the lists of people they \nfollowed to identify other climate sceptic Twitter users with large numbers of fol -\nlowers. Previous studies have already found that the followers of climate sceptics \nare more evenly distributed (Williams et  al., 2015). I  have certa inly not captured \nall climate sceptics, and there might be some influential ones whom I  missed. Yet, \nI included nine accounts in this analysis and studied 18; I  assume that if there were \ninfluential trends that differ significantly from the ones I  identify, I  would have \nfound some trace of them on the accounts of the climate sceptics I  studied. Includ -\ning more climate sceptics in the analysis is unlikely to have altered the findings \ndramatically.\nI define social media success on the basis of how many followers these actors \nhave, and how often their most popular messages get liked, shared and commented \non. I have identified these messages manually in the time period between Septem -\nber 2020 and January  2021. I  describe and interpret the messages below in line with \na netnographic approach (Costello et  al., 2017), which applies ethnographic meth -\nods to the online environment. I  traced the relevant messages and analysed what \nother users, who have picked the messages up, further did with them. I  also studied \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  241\nhow the messages travelled across different social media platforms, by identify -\ning the direction of traffic based on the dates when posts appeared. Overall the \nqualitative analysis inductively identifies some specific and original strategies that \ncan succeed on social media, and potentially lead to lasting change offline. Other \nstrategies can already fail online and therefore do not even carry the potential for \nchange in the real world. Other scholars might pick the strategies up, operationalise \nthem, and test them quantitatively.\nA Qualitative Analysis of Climate Sceptics\u2019 and the Climate Strike \nMovement\u2019s Activities on Social Media\nWhile Greta Thunberg has 10.5  million followers on Instagram, 4.4  million fol -\nlowers on Twitter and 3.2  million followers on Facebook, the most popular climate \nsceptics have between 30,000 and 70,000 followers on Twitter, and use Facebook \nand Instagram significantly less. Many do not have any public accounts on Face -\nbook and Instagram; when they do, their follower numbers tend to be lower than \non Twitter, with a maximum of around 40,000 followers. These very basic findings \nare surprising and warrant an explanation. Populists and the Alt-right, with whom \nclimate sceptics are closely associated (although some populists are environmental \npreservationists), are otherwise very successful on social media. Why are climate \nsceptics not?\nClimate Sceptics\u2019 Failed Social Media Strategy\nClimate sceptics adopt two disparate strategies on social media. The first strategy \nentails imitating a scientific discourse to debunk the scientific consensus on climate \nchange. Scholars studying climate sceptic conservative think tanks have consist -\nently noted that they have not changed their discursive strategy of denying climate \nchange science over time (Busch  & Judick, 2021). The second strategy consists \nof incorporating a critique of climate change science and climate change mitiga -\ntion policies into a much larger societal and political discourse associated with the \nultra-right agenda, the threats of socialism and the Making America Great Again \n(MAGA) movement. Here it is worth noting though, that the far-right is not unified \nin its approach to the environment. Many far-right groupings include the preserva -\ntion of a pristine environment in their program (Forchtner, 2020).\nThe accounts imitating a scientific discourse to delegitimise the scientific con -\nsensus on climate change are Watts Up With That (29.3K followers on Twitter), \nThe Global Warming Policy Forum (12.8K followers on Twitter), Climate Realists \n(47.8K followers on Twitter), Judith Curry (28.2K followers on Twitter), Friends \nof Science (37.1K followers on Twitter) and JWSpry (19.4K followers on Twitter).\nThese users rely on the image of science and seek to optically imitate sci -\nence to undermine the scientific findings of climate change, a strategy that has \nalready been noted by other scholars (Bloomfield  & Tillery , 2019; Boussalis  & \n\n242  Alena Drieschova\nCoan, 2015; Elgesem, Steskal,  & Diakopoulos, 2015; Schmid-Petri, 2017; Shar -\nman, 2014). Typically, they provide hyperlinks to their own blog posts, some do \nso almost exclusively, such as Watts Up With That, the Global Warming Policy \nForum or Climate Realists. They use images that appear scientific, such as global \nmaps with temperature measures, graphs of CO2 emissions and temperature rises, \nmicroscope photographs of microbes, hurricane imagery, diagrams or photographs \nof nature and animals. They list equations and supply data. For example, a Twitter \npost on Watts Up With That from 4 January  2021 shows a map of the United States \nwith mean daily temperature changes from the period between 1981 and 1990 \nto the period between 2011 and 2020. According to the map the mid-west of the \nUnited States has cooled down, whereas temperatures in the Western United States \nhave increased. The argument is that changes in temperature are due to changes in \nland-use patterns. Urbanisation leads to increases in temperature and temperature \nchanges should be population weighted.\nSome of the sites also post information about events they host with alternative \nexperts and contrarian scientists, such as webinars, or lectures. For example, the \nGlobal Policy Forum hosted a webinar on 17 November  2020 with Professor Rich -\nard Tol, Professor Ross McKitrick and Victoria Hewson on the effectiveness of \ncarbon taxes. They then post videos of lecture recordings on their account.\nOther users, like Friends of Science post links to a variety of different sites. They \ncan post web links to climate sceptic blogs like Watts Up With That or the Global \nWarming Policy Forum, alongside selective posts to more mainstream blogs, such \nas The Conversation, or mass media sites like The Times, if those sites contain arti -\ncles with titles that appear to confirm their hypothesis that climate change is a hoax. \nThe strategy is to provide alternative data that demonstrate the earth is not actually \ngetting warmer, and extreme weather events occur more rarely rather than more \nfrequently, or to provide alternative accounts for why global warming takes place, \nsuch as a heating of the sun. The accounts also seek to generate a general mistrust \nof climate scientists\u2019 work. They criticize them by arguing that their findings are \nnot scientifically valid, because they are based on incomplete data, or incorrect \nmethods. For example, a Twitter post from the Global Warming Policy Forum from \n29 December  2020 links to a post on the blog Science Under Attack, which argues \nthat the \u2018ancient climate was warmer than today\u2019s\u2019. The post summarises in detail \ntwo studies that have discovered these findings (including the methodologies they \nused) and includes graphs and maps, but no references to the studies in question.\nWhile climate sceptics imitate a scientific discourse on the surface, there are \nalso some differences in linguistic form. Compared to the mainstream scientific \ndiscourse, as exemplified in the reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, climate sceptics express themselves with more certainty, less formality, \nand more emotionality, primarily in the form of anger (Medimorec  & Pennycook, \n2015). The tone of language becomes for example apparent from a Tweet by Watts \nUp With That from 2 January  2021. The T weet introduces a blogpost with the words \n\u2018Inconvenient Truth: Climate-related death risk down 99.6% over 100  years\u2019.\n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  243\nPerhaps because of the effort to imitate the scientific discourse Twitter appears \nto be the most popular social media site for climate sceptics among the ones I  stud-\nied. Some of the users do not have Facebook accounts, the ones that do are likely to \nhave less followers on Facebook than on Twitter, although Facebook has a signifi -\ncantly larger user base than Twitter. Climate sceptic Facebook accounts also tend \nto post less material than the same users post on Twitter. Typically, the material on \nFacebook is less original, and users rather rely on reposting weblog entries. It is \nvery rare that climate sceptics imitating the scientific approach use Instagram at \nall. I  could only identify one account, namely Friends of Science, which has 161 \nfollowers, and the posts are amateurish videos about climate change, which obtain \naround 10 likes.\nAs a micro-blogging site Twitter perhaps also bears the highest resemblance \nto the web blogs, which many of these climate sceptics initially created. On their \nsocial media accounts they continue to apply the same strategies they used for their \nblogs. A  scientific framing has been crucial for the positioning of the most impor -\ntant climate sceptic blogs.\nThese central blogs [have been] key protagonists in a process of attempted \nexpert knowledge delegitimisation and contestation, acting not only as transla -\ntors between scientific research and lay audiences, but, in their reinterpretation \nof existing climate science knowledge claims, are acting themselves as alterna -\ntive public sites of expertise for a climate sceptical audience.\n(Sharman, 2014, p.  159)\nClimate sceptics\u2019 reliance on science is a purely performative act, based on the \nvisualisation of the hyperlink and imagery that appears science-like, but lacks any \nsubstantive dimension. These users value \u2018the appearance of objectivity and being \naware of \u201cscientific facts\u201d that ordinary environmentalists are either unaware of \nor unable to process because they are \u201cduped\u201d by experts with nefarious motives\u2019 \n(Bloomfield  & Tillery , 2019, p.  28). Yet, the reliance on the optics of science might \nprevent this community from reaching a wider audience on social media, where \nfast, emotional reactions, identity-forming features, community-building dimen -\nsions, and particular but universalisable imagery are key affordances that can be \nexploited for success. The affordances of social media might not be the same as the \naffordances of blogs, and applying the same strategy for social media as for blog \nposts, might not lead to the desired results. Those social media posts that appear \nscience-like tend not to receive many likes and shares; they typically reach some -\nwhere between 10 and 30 likes for the less popular posts, and the most popular \nposts reach around 500 likes. This observation is in line with the finding that anti-\nclimate change posts do not appear particularly credible (Samantray  & Pin, 2019).\nBy contrast, some of these users on occasion also post comics, memes, and \nsarcastic videos. These posts are more successful; particularly mocking Greta \nThunberg reaches high levels of popularity. A  comic posted on 2 December  2019 \n\n244  Alena Drieschova\non Facebook by I  Love Carbon Dioxide shows mother nature with a sign \u2018record \nbreaking cold\u2019. An angry Greta covered in snow is standing next to her saying \n\u2018how dare you\u2019 and holding a stop global warming sign in her hand. On 6 Novem -\nber 2019 the same user posted a meme on Facebook which contains a photograph \nof Greta Thunberg from her UN speech with a speech bubble saying \u2018you have \nstolen my dreams and my childhood!\u2019 Underneath it is the picture of a black boy in \nrough terrain saying, \u2018Getting that Cobalt for your electric cars fast as I  can Greta\u2019. \nA video posted by I  Love Carbon Dioxide of a teenage girl mocking Greta Thun -\nberg in the style of stand-up comedians reached 1.9K likes on Facebook; it is the \nmost popular video of this user.\nA second strategy climate sceptics have employed is to incorporate climate \nchange scepticism in a significantly larger set of societal critiques following an \nultra-right agenda. Thus Stephen McIntyre\u2019s account is called Climate Audit \n(35.2K followers), but he does not post much about climate change on Twitter, \ndespite the account\u2019s name. Similarly, Marc Morano has as his Twitter username \nand profile picture Climate Depot (24.7K followers on Twitter). Yet his Twitter \naccount only occasionally touches upon climate change-related issues and mainly \nfocuses on day-to-day American politics expressing a strong support for Trump \nand Republicans. He provides links to a large set of news stories stemming from \nmainstream media as well as from more fringe sites. For example, he posted a story \nentitled \u2018Up to Two Thirds of Serious Covid Infections are Caught in Hospital \u2013  \nStudy\u2019 from lockdownsceptics.org on 10 March  2021. On the same date, he also \nposted a news story from Reuters titled \u2018China launches COVID-19 vaccina -\ntion certificates for cross-border travel\u2019, a story from the New York Post entitled  \n\u2018Disney+ prevents kids from watching \u201cracist\u201d classics including \u201cDumbo\u201d  \u2019, and \na story from iceagenow.info entitled \u2018US February was the coldest in 32  years\u2019, \namong others. He also retweets an eclectic set of Tweets. Despite his extremely \nprolific Twitter activity his Tweets do not get liked or retweeted very frequently, \nmostly 10\u201320 times per Tweet.\nThe Facebook account (with 6448 followers) mainly serves to promote the blog \nposts of Climate Depot, which critique climate change science and policy. The \nstyle does not imitate science, but rather journalism and news satire. A  post from \n21 April  2021 for example reads \u2018Would you believe it? As one of our commenta -\ntors predicted, Facebook is now suppressing a post about FB suppressing a post \nabout FB suppression of the New York Post. Mr. Zuckerberg, tear down these algo -\nrithms!\u2019 Another one from 19 July  2019 says \u2018America\u2019 s Apollo Astronauts want \nNASA to knock off the climate propaganda and focus on hard science and space\u2019. \nPhotographs and comics are meant to draw readers in. One comic shows a green \nbroken car that is close to falling apart with a license plate that says socialism. \nIn the car are Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, John Kerry, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth \nWarren and Kamala Harris among others. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is holding a \npicture frame around them that has written \u2018Green New Deal\u2019 on it. The text above \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  245\nthe image reads \u2018How many times must socialism fail?\u2019 Satirical comments of \nGreta Thunberg with the corresponding imagery are a comparatively popular item \nto generate user engagement with around 300 likes and 100 shares. One of those \nfrom 11 December  2019 shows the Times cover that announced Greta Thunberg as \nthe Times person of the year; a text next to it reads \u2018Contrary to what your parents \ntold you, turns out skipping school and hysterical hissy fits was the way to go after \nall\u2019. While the Twitter account is extraordinarily prolific with several dozens of \nTweets and Retweets per day, the Facebook account typically receives one post \nevery couple of months.\nNaomi Seibt, labelled the \u2018anti-Greta\u2019, and one of the most successful climate \nsceptics with 43.2K followers on Twitter does not actually tweet very much about \nclimate change, and more about American politics, her support for Donald Trump \nand the MAGA movement. Many of her Tweets are acerbic comments on the day-\nto-day of American politics without any embedded links or pictures. For exam -\nple, on 12 January  2021 she tweeted \u2018Add #BlackLivesMatter to your Tweets \nfor purge immunity\u2019 in response to the shutting of several Facebook and Twitter \naccounts linked to the Capitol riots in support of Donald Trump on 6 January  2021. \nTwo days later she tweeted as a commentary on the COVID-19 lockdown \u2018Over \n100,000 new migrants seeking asylum; during a heavy lockdown for the rest of us \nsheeple who are only allowed to move within a radius of 15km \u2013 \u201copen borders\u201d \nonly goes one way\u2019.\nNaomi is significantly less active on Facebook, where her account functioned as \na personal account until early 2019, when she started to use her Facebook account \nprimarily to circulate her self-made videos on a number of different political issues, \nsuch as critiques of Feminism, the need for free speech, critiques of migration \npolicies, and climate change mitigation. The links received a few hundred to a \nthousand likes. A  link to a Washington Post  article that labelled Naomi Seibt as \nthe anti-Greta obtained 5.3K likes. Naomi happily adopted the label and has been \nportraying herself along these lines. Her Instagram strategy is entirely different. \nAlthough her bio makes a reference to Greta Thunberg, when it states \u2018I don\u2019t want \nyou to panic. I  want you to think\u2019, the account is quite apolitical. She mainly posts \nselfies in the gym or in a dance studio without much political commentary, but \noccasionally wears a Trump T-shirt. She has 7220 Followers on Instagram and her \nposts get liked around 1000\u20132000 times. Naomi\u2019s videos and pictures come across \nas self-made and not very professional, but with a general effort to follow basic \nprinciples of composition in terms of colouring and positioning. Her bodily posture \nand facial expression are reminiscent of posing apparently imitating models.\nWhile the first social media strategy of climate sceptics entails emulating the \npictorial and linguistic discourse of mainstream climate change science to delegiti -\nmise it, the second strategy focuses on embedding climate change scepticism into \nthe broader agenda of the far right, and employing similar discursive strategies \nas the ultra-right employs on topics such as immigration, race, elite conspiracies, \n\n246  Alena Drieschova\nand vaccines (see also Kaiser  & Puschmann, 2017; Lewandowsky, Gignac,  & \nOberauer, 2015). Neither of these two strategies is particularly successful on social \nmedia in terms of user engagement. The imitation of scientific discourse strategy \nworked extraordinarily well in the traditional media environment, in which the nor -\nmative legitimacy of science carries a high currency. Yet, science appears boring \nand complicated from a social media perspective in which fast reactions are key, \nparticularly so if account holders do not have any significant institutional back -\ning that would ensure them high follower numbers. Science also does not make \nfor good identity politics and forms of self-expression. The strategy does not use \nthe affordances social media provide to their best effect, and this might explain its \ncomparative lack of success in social media engagement. Climate sceptics have \nnot managed to trigger the logic of connective action on social media. The second \nstrategy of embedding climate scepticism into the far-right discourse has also not \nproven particularly successful so far. This could potentially change in the future, if \nthe far-right decides to focus on climate scepticism and succeeds in framing it as a \ntopic that can increase its followers and keep existing followers engaged. For now, \nthis does not seem to be the case. Other topics such as migration, or vaccination \nyield far more user engagement than climate change.\nClimate sceptics\u2019 lack of success on social media, despite their apparent poten -\ntial, demonstrates how it depends upon agents to seize the affordances technologies \nprovide. In this sense social media has changed which agents can become influen -\ntial, and the mechanisms of how influence emerges, but this does not mean that all \nagents will realise the new opportunities available to them. How social orders will \nchange depends on which agents get the upper hand, and how those agents realise \nthe new possibilities that open up.\nA lone teenager, Greta Thunberg, has been highly successful in starting an entire \nclimate strike movement. She has become the voice of the younger generation, \nbased on her social media presence, and is now representing the youth in many \nprominent climate fora. She obtained a public voice, sometimes a seat at the table. \nMany other teenagers have followed in her footsteps and have become similar (if \nless successful) social media celebrities combating climate change.\nAccounting for Greta Thunberg\u2019s Success on Social Media\nGreta Thunberg, a Swedish teenager, provided the inspiration for the Fridays for \nFuture and the Climate Strike movement. On 20 August  2018 Greta sat with a hand \npainted banner, which read \u2018Skolstrekj f\u00f6r Klimatet\u2019 alone in front of the Swedish \nparliament. She had a picture taken of herself and posted it on Twitter. Already \non the second day other people joined her. Before long, her Twitter photographs \nwent viral and inspired an entire movement. Fridays for Future was formed in The \nHague on 4 September  2018, and on 14 September  2018 in Berlin. Greta gave her \nfirst public speech on 8 September at the Peoples\u2019 Climate March in Stockholm. \nShe was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize three times in a row (2019\u20132021), \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  247\nshe obtained Amnesty International\u2019s Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the \nGeddes Environment Medal from the Royal Scottish Geographical Society. She \nbecame Time\u2019s person of the year. She spoke in front of the UN General Assembly, \nand in front of the European Parliament. She met with many prominent politicians, \nsuch as Angela Merkel, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ursula von der Leyen, and \nmany celebrities have endorsed her. Greta Thunberg is the face that has provided a \nsense of urgency to the \u2018climate crisis\u2019, a call for action, and a sense of responsibil -\nity to the adult world. She has dramatically shifted the public discourse, and might \nprovide the ammunition for lasting policy change to address climate change.\nIt is worth noting that in the beginning was Twitter. Greta Thunberg\u2019s notoriety \nemerged from her Twitter photographs going viral online. Without Twitter only a \nfew passers-by would have noticed the lonely schoolgirl striking in front of the \nSwedish parliament. Even if legacy media had picked up on the story (unlikely), \nI will argue in the following, they would not have provided the affordances that \nled to Greta Thunberg becoming an inspiration for an entire, very powerful youth \nmovement.\nThe picture on the first day on which Greta went on strike obtained 1.8 K \nretweets and 6.8K likes on Twitter. Prior to this post from 20 August  2018, Greta \nhad a few other posts on Twitter, which obtained the same number of retweets and \nlikes as the posts of any person with a decent social media network of friends. \nHer posts on Facebook and Instagram are of a significantly later date. Her first \npicture on Facebook dates from 7 December  2018. T witter was her launching site \nof choice, although she now has a significantly larger crowd of followers on Insta -\ngram and Facebook.\nThe photograph from 20 August, her first day of climate striking, marks a drastic \ndeparture in Greta\u2019s popularity. The picture captures the eye by its ordinariness. \nGreta sits on the pavement reclined against a stone wall. Her knees are a little \nelevated, leaning against each other and her hands are folded on top of them. She is \nslightly slumped. The body posture is unassuming, not imposing at all, a little shy \nperhaps, a bit innocent, but not apologetic. The face is the face of a child, but it has \na certain dauntlessness and is slightly accusatory with sharpened eyes and pressed \nlips that won\u2019t form into a smile. The composition does not follow the ideals of \nphotography; her shoes are for example partly cut off from the image, and the angle \nis not the most flattering one. There is no attempt to pose and look good in front of \nthe camera. The clothes are mismatched, and do not follow any fashion ideals. If \nanything, the image expresses a complete disregard for fashion; in fact, the image\u2019s \naesthetics expresses a complete disregard for form altogether. It highlights that the \nsubstance of the issue is what matters. In many ways the photograph goes against \nthe culture of self-representation on social media. It provokes by its ordinariness \nand simplicity, and thus generates a sense of authenticity. The substance of the \nmessage is key, and there is no distracting from it through aesthetic effects, no lur -\ning into the image. Here is an ordinary, tiny, vulnerable teenager with no power in \nher hands, and she decides on her own to go on a school strike for the climate; to \n\n248  Alena Drieschova\nput her own personal future at risk, because, frankly, that personal future will not \nexist, if adults do not sort out the climate crisis. The child already serves as a sym -\nbol of the future (Adler-Nissen et  al., 2019; Burman, 1994); a school strike does \neven more so. That the future of humanity is at stake is expressed very powerfully \nin this deceptively ordinary photograph.\nIn this treacherous simplicity, anybody can imitate the photograph. It demon -\nstrates the possibilities for ordinary everyday actions to address climate change, a \ntopic that has hitherto been deemed so complex and grand that no individual could \nmake a difference. Inspired by Greta Thunberg across social media people started \nposting pictures of themselves holding a hand painted banner expressing in differ -\nent languages \u2018Skolstrekj f\u00f6r Klimatet\u2019. In this sense the photograph has become a \nmeme into which other individuals can insert themselves with their own banners, \nand thus express their personal engagement for combating climate change, but also \ntheir personal identity, as well as their adherence to a diffuse online community that \npursues the same objectives. Across three kinds of social media, Twitter, Facebook \nand Instagram Greta\u2019s most frequent posts are photographs of herself with a hand \npainted banner on which is written \u2018Skolstrekj f\u00f6r Klimatet\u2019 behind various kinds \nof backgrounds, depending on where she was currently travelling. These photo -\ngraphs have become global icons, \u2018images that circulate immediately to a world -\nwide audience generating an emotional response\u2019 (Hansen, 2016, pp.  271\u2013272).\nWhile photographic reinstallations of Greta Thunberg\u2019s initial images of her \nclimate strike are extraordinarily common across social media, other adaptations \nof her photographs are less common. On a few occasions, comics, memes and \nphotographic collages appear that mock Greta, and those are among climate scep -\ntics\u2019 most popular posts, but their popularity still fades in the light of Greta\u2019s pho -\ntographs and their reinstallations. The one profile adaptation that went similarly \nviral on social media as the photographs themselves is the text \u2018#FacetheClima -\nteEmergency\u2019, which people can superimpose on their profile picture. Just like the \nphotographs with climate strike signs themselves, these profile adaptations allow \nusers to express their personal identity, their allegiance to an online community \nthat pursues the same cause, and become politically active without a very large \ntime commitment.\nAll the photographs collectively are raising an accusation, and a call for action. \nThey are creating an urgency and an immediacy about a trend that forms the back -\ndrop of people\u2019s lives, but which for now allows almost everybody to continue \nuninhibited. In similar, yet different, ways as the photograph of the drowned child \nAllan Kurdi (Alder-Nissen, Andersen,  & Hansen, 2020), they make an interpel -\nlation (Althusser, 2001). They address adults, and in particular political elites by \ncalling them to responsibility and to action. If adults accept this interpellation, they \nare accepting the subject position of responsible adults who need to act decisively \nto mitigate climate change, or else carry the responsibility for the impending dis -\naster. The difference to the Allan Kurdi photograph is that Allan Kurdi is a victim, \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  249\nand nothing but a victim, whereas the climate change kids are victims, who derive \ntheir agency and their strength from their victimhood. Allan Kurdi has been photo -\ngraphed, his image spread on social and mass media without him doing anything \nabout it. His dead body is a passive object who happened to become the carrier of \na message, unwittingly. Greta Thunberg and her followers are the active carriers of \ntheir own messages, they are voicing their victimhood, and demanding for action.\nOf course, the success of Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement \nis not limited to social media engagement, and if it stayed exclusively a social \nmedia phenomenon, it would not have reached the level of success, urgency and \nstaying power, that is putting political leaders under pressure to do something to \nmitigate climate change. Mass rallies and protests were important; Greta Thun -\nberg\u2019s articulation skills, her unique charisma, and her ability to deliver trenching \nspeeches in front of large crowds mattered for her to attain the high-level podia. \nAnd those speeches get recorded, and shared in videos on social media. Social \nmedia were the important launching pad that allowed this tiny, introverted and \nemotional teenager to reach the world stage, and they provide a feedback loop \nthrough which her and the movement\u2019s messages can circulate and influence ever \nlarger crowds. It was thanks to social media that an estimated 1.6  million children \nand teenagers in 125 countries across the world protested against climate change \nin mid-March  2019. According to a survey undertaken at the strike, social media \nwas the most important information channel for participants to find out about the \nstrike and decide to attend it (Wahlstr\u00f6m et  al., 2019, p.  14). Among of the school \nstudents who participated in the march  45% said that Greta Thunberg was a fac -\ntor in their decision to join the climate strike (Wahlstr\u00f6m et  al., 2019, p.  5). On \n20 September  2019 the probably largest climate protest in world history occurred \n(Marris, 2019). \u2018It is drama, it is novelty, it is authenticity, and it is catastrophe\u2019 \n(Nisbet in Marris, 2019, p.  472)\u2013 all those things that engender large user engage -\nment on social media. Pictures of the protests circulate on social media and through \na positive feedback loop generate larger followership. A  quantitative analysis of \nTwitter and English-language mass media similarly identified the importance of \nsocial media for organising the Climate Strike movement, but also the support the \nmovement received from the legacy media (Chen et  al., 2022).\nNot everybody has responded to Greta Thunberg and the Fridays for Future \nimagery in the same way. She has provoked some angry reactions. Some have \nmocked her for her relative luxury in comparison to impoverished children in \nAfrica. People have attacked her dress choices as not being in line with fashion. \nOthers have ridiculed her emotionality. Still others claimed that teenagers cannot \npossibly have political agency. By and larger, however, the response has been one \nof admiration, and support.\nGreta Thunberg has moved from the status of a networked microcelebrity to \na globally known cultural icon. Social media were crucial in her success. And \nshe was successful on social media because as a teenage girl she could use her \n\n250  Alena Drieschova\nvulnerability, a unique aesthetic style (that appears entirely unaesthetic), and emo -\ntionally charged messaging to obtain attention online and disseminate her message \nfor the need of profound political change.\nOne might wonder how much of Greta Thunberg\u2019s success is due to the mes -\nsage, and how much of it is due to the particular strategy of the messenger. Obvi -\nously, it is impossible to quantify these effects. Both mattered in their combination, \nboth were necessary, but only in their combination they became sufficient condi -\ntions. Greta Thunberg has been preceded and followed by other young female cli -\nmate activists, and while many of them have been very successful on social media, \nnone has come even close to the notoriety of Greta Thunberg. Luisa Neubauer has \n210,900 followers on Twitter and 229,000 followers on Instagram, Xiye Bastida \nhas 17,400 followers on Twitter and 35,700 followers on Instagram, Jamie Mar -\ngolin has 55,700 followers on Twitter, and 53,400 followers on Instagram, Severn \nCullis-Suzuki has 15,100 followers on Twitter, 11,200 followers on Instagram and \n75,000 followers on Facebook, and Alexandria Villase\u00f1or has 56,400 followers \non Twitter. These young female climate activists share many characteristics with \nGreta Thunberg, but they also differ from her in terms of aesthetic style, emotional \nexpressivity and directness, among others. Other female climate activists can for \nexample accentuate their ethnic origins, or they follow some form of easily recog -\nnisable fashion standards in the North Atlantic region. They tend to highlight their \nfemininity more, and downplay their child-like features.\nOn the other hand, Naomi Seibt as one of the most successful climate sceptics \nshares some characteristics with Greta. Naomi frequently talks about some further \nunspecified health conditions that she is struggling with, and her appearance is \nslightly outside the norm in that one of the pupils of her eyes is in an unusual posi -\ntion. Otherwise she typically dresses in more revealing clothes than Greta, but the \nprior two features give her an added element of vulnerability, and relatability due \nto imperfection, that bears some semblance to Greta\u2019s vulnerability.\nIn sum, the message and the peculiar style of the messenger have allowed Greta \nThunberg to reach millions of people on social media, who could appropriate her \nmessage and make it a part of their own online identity. She developed a highly \noriginal strategy to exploit the affordances social media provide, and fully enter into \nthe logic of connective action. Social media has empowered a new kind of agent, \nand a new kind of messaging strategy, a new form of \u2018winning over\u2019, which has \nhad a significant impact on changing the societal discourse of climate change in the \nNorth Atlantic region, and carries the potential to change the climate change order.\nEuropean policy makers realise the power Greta Thunberg has. European Com -\nmission President Ursula von der Leyen has invited Greta Thunberg to the Euro -\npean Commission on 4 March  2020, the day the College of Commissioners voted \non the Climate Law. In a press communique Ursula von der Leyen (2020) stated that \n\u2018Greta speaks for many of her generation when she calls for more action to tackle \nclimate change\u2019 (von der Leyen, 2020). In a speech to the European Parliament in \nwhich Ursula von der Leyen introduced the European Green Deal she explicitly \n\nSocial Media Revolution\u00a0& Shifts in Climate Change Discourse  251\nsaid that \u2018only one year ago no one would have imagined that millions would take \nto the streets for climate\u2019, and that \u2018our children are not passive spectators; they \nare very active players in this endeavour. .  . . Our climate pact will be with them, \nand for them\u2019. She concluded with saying \u2018Europeans are calling on us to drive the \nchange, now it\u2019s up to us to answer their call\u2019 (von der Leyen, 2019). Frans Tim -\nmermans, Vice-President of the European Commission, and responsible for the \nEuropean Green Deal, has requested Thunberg\u2019s and the climate strike movement\u2019s \nsupport for implementing radical reforms to the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy, \nwhich they have happily provided on social media. To be sure, Greta Thunberg and \nthe climate strike movement think that the European Green Deal lacks ambition \nand is not enough to uphold the targets in the Paris agreement (Politico, 2021). Yet, \nthe fact that world leaders are referencing them when adopting important climate \nlegislation indicates that they have become a crucial legitimating force, and thus \nindeed carry the potential to shape the climate change discourse. The establishment \nendorsement of the Climate strike movement, in turn, helps the movement gain \nfurther notoriety and legitimacy.\nConclusion\nIn this chapter I  have argued that social media hold specific affordances, such as \nallowing the lonely crowds to gather in a virtual space, and people to express their \nidentity online, and become politically engaged with significantly lower oppor -\ntunity costs. They permit new kinds of actors to reach large audiences, if those \nactors succeed in using the affordances social media provide effectively. Against \nthe argument that digitisation empowers particularly tech savvy individuals (see \nGiacomello and Eriksson, this volume), the present analyses found that specific \nyoung women without much tech knowledge have learned to use their vulnerabil -\nity, aesthetic style and emotionally charged messages to gain a voice on social \nmedia, generate large crowds of followers, and avail themselves of their social \nmedia accounts to advocate for political change. The logic of connective action, \nbased on mechanisms of self-presentation and responses to that self-presentation \nthat follow a networked dynamic, can lead to significant discursive shifts. Those \nshifts can impact the background layers of international order.\nI have focused the analysis on the potential social media hold for shifting the cli -\nmate change discourse. I  studied two kinds of actors who stood to gain from social \nmedia: climate sceptics, and the climate strike movement, notably Greta Thunberg. \nThe aim was to identify the impact of these actors in shaping the mainstream cli -\nmate change discourse through their social media usage. The findings demonstrate \nthat while climate sceptics have so far not been able to use the affordances social \nmedia provide to their advantage and generate a significant logic of connective \naction, the climate strike movement and Greta Thunberg have been extraordinar -\nily successful, and do hold the potential to shift the climate change discourse. \nSocial media has changed the distribution of power among actors, and agential \n\n252  Alena Drieschova\nmechanisms of \u2018winning over\u2019. Changes in societal discourses have resulted from \nthese shifts, which carry the potential to lead to a change in the climate order.\nAllan (2017a) argued that neither the securitisation of climate change nor more \nscientific certainty about climate change will bring about a solution to the problem, \nbut \u2018scientific cosmologies to construct positive visions of a sustainable future\u2019 \ncould (Allan, 2017b, p.  818). And that \u2018the problem in climate discourse may be the \nemphasis on the problem rather than on generating images of the solution\u2019 (Allan, \n2017b, p.  818).\nGreta Thunberg and the climate strike movement do securitise the climate, and \nthey emphasise the problem, rather than generating visions of a positive future. \nYet, they have succeeded in creating a discursive space that provides room for \n\u2018subjective and normative imaginations of climate alongside the universal, apoliti -\ncal climate imaginary proffered by science (Jasanoff, 2010)\u2019 (Pearce et  al., 2018, \np. 9). They are framing climate change as a matter of inter-generational and global \njustice. Calling upon the responsibility of adults to protect their own children has \nturned out to be a successful rhetorical strategy. As has been the suggestion that \nany individual can in their everyday life make a difference in combating climate \nchange, that the magnitude of the problem does not prevent small people and small \nacts from acquiring great meaning.\nClimate scepticism, in turn, is not particularly successful on social media. Yet, \nthere is a caveat to bear in mind: populism and the ultra-right are thriving in the \nsocial media environment, and climate scepticism can thrive with these political \nmovements, although some of them espouse environmental conservatism. While \nclimate scepticism is not a popularity booster or vote catcher for the time being, \nincreasing climate scepticism could become a side effect of a potential increase in \nthe popularity of the ultra-right.\nNotes\n 1 It is worth noting though that different far-right groupings in different countries adopt \ndifferent kinds of environmental discourses; many on the far-right espouse environmental \nprotectionism (Forchtner, 2020).\n 2 Agw stands for anthropogenic global warming.\nReferences\nAdler, E.,  & Drieschova, A.

Given the compara -\ntive recency of cyberspace governance as an issue and the ongoing acceleration \nof technological change, it would be foolish to suggest that it has reached any -\nthing resembling maturity. Nevertheless, it is possible to trace a trajectory from \ninitial debates of the legal status of cyberspace ( Barlow, 1996 ; Goldsmith, 1998 ; \nJohnson  & Post, 1996 ),1 through proposals for its designation as a res communis , \nglobal common or common heritage of mankind with parallels to shared sea-, \nair- and outer space ( Hollis, 2012 ; Segura-Serrano, 2006 ); to the extensive work \nof the Tallinn group of experts on the applicability of existing international law \nto cyber conflict ( Schmitt, 2013 ) and cyber operations ( Schmitt, 2017 ); to pro -\nposals for \u2018international internet law\u2019, among them a restatement of core prin -\nciples ( Uerpmann-Wittzack, 2010 ), the introduction of international cyber torts \n(Crootof, 2018 ), and a common customary ius internet  on the model of the Roman \nEmpire\u2019s ius gentium  (Balleste  & Kulesza, 2013 ). While researchers are agreed \nthat non-binding norms for responsible behaviour and confidence building meas -\nures also have a role to play in cyberspace governance, opinion is divided as to \ntheir primary function: for some, their utility is in preparing the ground for and \nfeeding into hard law ( Schmitt  & Vihul, 2014a ); for others, they substitute for hard \nlaw, because a binding multilateral treaty on cyberspace is deemed either unrealis -\ntic or unnecessary ( Eichensehr, 2015 ; Grigsby, 2017 ; Hitchens  & Gallagher, 2019 ; \nZiolkowski, 2013 ).\nIn light of extensive misuse of digital technology for criminal purposes, influ -\nence operations, espionage and attacks on critical infrastructure, most public and 10\nDIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES, \nGOVERNANCE AND  \nINTERNATIONAL LAW\nVictoria Baines\n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  259\nprivate stakeholders have abandoned Barlow\u2019s claim that \u2018legal concepts do not \napply to cyberspace\u2019, some with greater reluctance than others, and agree that \nregulation is both inevitable and desirable. Precisely what flavour (multilateral or \nmultistakeholder) and what form (treaty, norms and principles, confidence building \nmeasures) is the matter at hand, and the source of not inconsiderable divergence. \nIn the absence of binding international agreements or relevant case law of any real \nsubstance, jurisprudence has assumed the role of \u2018interpretation catalyst\u2019, in Ing-\nber\u2019s (2017 ) suggested terminology. Scholarly processes such as the interpretation \nof international law by the experts convened for the Tallinn Manuals themselves \nfoster further dialogue and provoke reaction. In the case of Russia and China, pub -\nlic rejection of the Tallinn Manuals has been a political act, predicated on their \ninitial sponsorship by NATO and a focus on existing international law that broadly \naligns with US statements on the applicability of the law of armed conflict (LOAC) \nto cyber operations ( Deeks, 2015 ; Huang  & Ma\u010d\u00e1k, 2017 ). As Mueller (2019 ) and \nothers note, US insistence on LOAC as the primary frame of international legal \nreference effectively militarises cyberspace. In both research and practice, interna -\ntional law in and on cyberspace has been constructed as a problem, to which the \ndominant proposed solutions have been to maintain the status quo or to develop an \nentirely new comprehensive instrument.\nNo small part of this problem appears to have sprung from a failure to agree on \nwhat cyberspace governance is, particularly as distinct from internet governance \n(Walden, 2013 ). While often tedious, agreeing terminology and scope provides \nmuch-needed clarity for concerned parties. In recent years, the increasing blur -\nring of the distinction between the control of ICT architecture (internet govern -\nance) and the control of content and behaviour (cyberspace governance) in the \nname of national security by some states \u2013 Russia and China among them \u2013 reflects \nboth internal public order concerns and fears of reliance on US technology ( Noc-\netti, 2015 ). The extent to which internet governance and cyberspace governance \nare no longer politically or legally discrete adds to the confusion and divergence \nabout who can participate in cyberspace governance, and how that participation is \nweighted. \u2018Governance\u2019 is itself an ambiguous term as regards cyberspace, vari -\nously denoting rules, norms and principles in the field of international law, and \ntechnical standards and community management in the sphere of multistakeholder \ninternet administration.\nThe politicisation of technical aspects of internet governance is a case in \npoint: once the preserve of engineers, internet governance fora have become \nbackdrops for strategic struggles over who controls the internet. In Decem -\nber 2012, the revised International Telecommunication Regulations famously \nfailed to achieve consensus following the introduction of a \u2018right of Member \nStates to access international telecommunications services\u2019 and other provisions \nthat were deemed to encroach on content policy. Signatories included Russia, \nChina and the majority of Gulf, African and South American states; the United \nStates, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the majority of EU states, India and \n\n260  Victoria Baines\nJapan refused to sign. As we shall see, these groupings bear some similarity to \nthe distribution of votes in multilateral negotiations on cybersecurity, suggesting \nshared state ethos and objectives in internet and cyberspace governance. Simi -\nlarly, the transition of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority\u2019s Domain Name \nSystem management and top-level domain assignment functions from effective \nUS government control in 2016 was celebrated as a landmark in global multi -\nstakeholder governance, especially in states for whom this historical relation -\nship has been seen as evidence of the United States\u2019 iniquitous technological \nhegemony (Finley, 2016; Weinberg, 2000 ).\nAt the same time, uncertainty over whether cyberspace governance is a national \nsecurity, economic or socio-cultural issue has resulted in incoherence within the \nvery organisations tasked with multilateral coordination. The subject has been dis -\ncussed concurrently in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly, where \nthe focus is Disarmament and International Security, and the Third Committee, \nfocused on social, humanitarian, and cultural issues. Deliberations in these parallel \nstreams have themselves proved rich material for scholarly investigation of stake -\nholder ideologies and dynamics, and prospects for rapprochement. For a time, the \nFirst Committee\u2019s Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) became \u2018the venue for \naddressing the future of cyber norms\u2019 ( Georgieva, 2020 , p. 39). Adoption by con -\nsensus of the norms outlined in the report of the 2015 group was deemed to \u2018hold \nout a new opportunity to lift the tempo of global advocacy of norms of state behav -\niour in cyberspace\u2019 ( Austin, McConnell,  & Neutze, 2015 , p. 3), at least until the \ngroup\u2019s failure to achieve consensus in 2017, when states including Cuba, China \nand Russia refused to concede to the United States\u2019 insistence on the applicability \nof LOAC to cyber conflict, a move that in the words of the Cuban representative \n\u2018would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in the context of ICT\u2019 \n(Grigsby, 2017 ; Henriksen, 2019 ; Rodr\u00edguez, 2017 ; Tikk & Kerttunen, 2017 )2, at \nleast until the group\u2019s failure to achieve consensus in 2017, when states includ -\ning Cuba, China and Russia refused to concede to the United States\u2019 insistence \non the applicability of LOAC to cyber conflict, a move that in the words of the \nCuban representative \u2018would legitimize a scenario of war and military actions in \nthe context of ICT\u2019 ( Grigsby, 2017 ; Henriksen, 2019 ; Rodr\u00edguez, 2017 ; Tikk & \nKerttunen, 2017 ).\nDrawing on existing internet governance paradigms, a multistakeholder model \nof cyber norm development has proliferated in a number of venues, of which Micro -\nsoft is one of the key proponents. As the pre-eminent actors in apparently diver -\ngent, and arguably divisive, approaches to cyberspace governance, the activities \nof the UN and Microsoft independently merit further investigation. Furthermore, \nevents in recent months indicate that both organisations are increasingly focused \non bridging ideological and practical divisions. The following sections examine \nthese developments, their prospects and possible synergies. They also seek to trace \na dynamic interaction with international law of state preoccupations in the exercise \nof internal and external digital sovereignty.\n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  261\nState of Play: Lex Lata, Lex Ferenda\nAt the time of writing, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime (Buda -\npest Convention, (CETS No.185) is the only binding multilateral treaty in the field \nof cyberspace governance. While its title suggests a focus on technical and criminal \nmatters, the inclusion of numerous procedural provisions for international coopera -\ntion, an additional protocol criminalising racist and xenophobic propaganda (ETS \n189), and guidance notes on critical infrastructure attacks, election interference, \nand terrorism, demonstrate a broader scope in practice ( Council of Europe, 2013 , \n2016a , 2019 ). Arguably because of its unique status, the Convention has been rati -\nfied by 65 states since its entry into force in 2004, among them 18 non-members of \nthe Council of Europe including the United States, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, \nand a number of Latin American, African, South Asian and Pacific nations.\nOf the 47 Council of Europe Member States, the Russian Federation is alone \nin having neither signed nor ratified the Convention. Reasons adduced for refusal \ninclude an assessment that its provision for cross-border data access (Art. 32b) \nconstitutes a violation of national sovereignty ( Gady  & Austin, 2010 ; Hakmeh  & \nPeters, 2020 ). For over a decade, it has pursued alternative arrangements for cyber -\nspace governance, notably in the UN General Assembly\u2019s Group of Governmental \nExperts (GGE) on Developments in the Field of Information and Telecommunica -\ntions in the Context of International Security. Established in 2005 pursuant to Gen -\neral Assembly resolution 60/45, as the name suggests this group has had a much \nwider focus than cybercrime. The Russian Federation chaired the group in the 65th \nsession (2009/2010) and has called more than once for a non-binding international \ncode of conduct:\nto identify the rights and responsibilities of States in the information space, \npromote constructive and responsible behaviour on their part and enhance their \ncooperation in addressing common threats and challenges in the information \nspace, in order to establish an information environment that is peaceful, secure, \nopen and founded on cooperation, and to ensure that the use of information and \ncommunications technologies and information and communications networks \nfacilitates the comprehensive economic and social development and well-being \nof peoples, and does not run counter to the objective of ensuring international \npeace and security.\n(A/66/359, p.  4)\nChina, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan joined this call in 2011, with the addition of \nKazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in 2015 (A/69/723). These same countries now form \nthe core of a larger group \u2013 including Angola, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, the \nSyrian Arab Republic and Venezuela \u2013 that brought a draft resolution, with the \nRussian Federation as its main sponsor, to the 74th General Assembly \u2018to establish \nan open-ended ad hoc intergovernmental committee of experts, representative of \n\n262  Victoria Baines\nall regions, to elaborate a comprehensive international convention on countering \nthe use of information and communications technologies for criminal purposes\u2019 \n(A/C.3/74/L.11/Rev.1). Adopted by vote on 18 November  2019, the resolution was \nopposed by the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, \nNew Zealand and all 27 European Union Member States.\nIt is tempting to see in this distribution a repeat of Cold War geopolitics. In \naddition to 34 abstentions (Brazil and Mexico among them), a number of large or \notherwise influential countries in the Middle East, Africa and Asia voted in favour, \nincluding the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, India, Malaysia \nand Singapore. While a disposition towards greater digital sovereignty in the form \nof moves to restrict internet freedoms in relation to both access to content and \ndigital surveillance may be one denominator for supporting states, a vote in favour \nof further exploration of a lex specialis  was doubtless also a symbolic rejection \nof the US predilection for the application of LOAC to cyber operations, and to \nsome extent of the US-endorsed peacetime regimes of the Budapest Convention \nand multistakeholder initiatives dominated by US corporations and NGOs.\nExisting International Law \u2013 Applicability Versus Sufficiency\nIn his foreword to the 2015 GGE report, the UN Secretary-General stated that \u2018few \ntechnologies have been as powerful as information and communications technolo -\ngies (ICTs) in re-shaping economies, societies and international relations. Cyber -\nspace touches every aspect of our lives\u2019 (A/70/174). This pervasiveness is reflected \nin the range of specialised regimes identified as having a bearing on cyberspace in \nthe Tallinn Manuals on the International Law Applicable to Cyber Warfare , and the \nInternational Law Applicable to Cyber Operations  (Schmitt, 2013 , 2017 ). For the \nsecond edition, relevant instruments were identified in international human rights \nlaw, diplomatic and consular law, the law of the sea, air law, space law, and inter -\nnational telecommunications law.\nOpponents to a lex specialis  for cyberspace point to the wide range of touch -\npoints in existing international law as a complicating factor for any comprehensive \nnew regime. The applicability of international law was accepted in the 2013 report \nof the UN General Assembly Group of Government Experts (GGE) (A/68/98 III \n19). Several multistakeholder initiatives promote the applicability specifically of \nthe UN Charter, including the Global Commission on Stability in Cyberspace, and \nthe 2018 Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, led by the French govern -\nment. Particular attention has been drawn to the Charter principles of sovereignty, \nsovereign equality, settlement of disputes by peaceful means and non-intervention.\nA key point of divergence concerns the sufficiency  of existing international law \nand has brought into focus a number of \u2018grey areas\u2019 currently exploited by states, \nparticularly as regards activities that do not meet the threshold of armed conflict, \nsuch as influence operations, cyber espionage, and the vast majority of cyber attacks \nto date. Accordingly, research has identified a de facto norm of \u2018anything goes\u2019, \n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  263\nin which attacks are unattributed or unchallenged ( Hathaway, 2017 ; Schmitt  & \nVihul, 2014b ), a \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 ( Georgieva, 2020 , p. 33) associated particu -\nlarly with perceived US hypocrisy following the Snowden revelations, and a legal \nuncertainty desirable to some states for the opportunities it creates ( Ma\u010d\u00e1k, 2017 ). \nThe pursuit of legal clarity by others is thus a normative statement of intent to hold \nthese states to account. It also raises practical considerations of jurisdiction and \nattribution in relation to cyber operations.\nTechnical Challenges to the Exercise of International Law\nEstablishing sovereign jurisdiction is very often problematic technically. Global \nprogress towards cloud processing and storage, accelerated through rapid virtu -\nalisation during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic, has led to a proliferation of data \nthat moves between or is mirrored in several jurisdictions ( Donnelly, 2020 ). These \nchallenges, highlighted by the Cloud Evidence Group of the Council of Europe \nCybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) as a \u2018loss of location\u2019, are yet to be \nresolved ( Council of Europe, 2015 , 2016b ; Seger, 2018 ).\nA further technical difficulty relates to the notion of attribution, on which the \nresponsibility of states depends to no small extent. It has become a commonplace \nin cybersecurity to refer to \u2018state-sponsored\u2019 cyber-attacks: this reflects the chal -\nlenge of attributing definitively to governments\u2019 cyber operations that may be out -\nsourced to non-state actors or otherwise frustrate state attribution through the use \nof proxies and anonymisers. In contrast to the launch of a missile, identifying the \norigin of a cyber-attack can require a substantial amount of \u2018tracking back\u2019, which \ncan take time.\nBy way of illustration, it took seven months to attribute the 2017 WannaCry \nransomware attack, which infected computers in more than 150 countries and led \nto the declaration of a major incident in the UK\u2019s National Health Service, to \u2018cyber \naffiliates of the North Korean government\u2019 ( Smart, 2018 ; The White House, 2017 ). \nThe hack and leak of the US Democratic National Committee\u2019s email server in \nthe run-up to the 2016 presidential election has been attributed to Russian hacking \ngroup APT 28 (aka Fancy Bear). APT 28 has in turn been identified by the US and \nUK governments as a front for the Russian GRU intelligence service: in 2018, the \nUnited States indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers on 11 counts, including two \ncounts of Conspiracy to Commit an Offense Against the United States ( Mueller, \n2018 ; Foreign  & Commonwealth Office, 2018 ).\nLegal scholars are divided on whether the 2016 hack constituted a violation \nof international law, specifically the principle of non-intervention. While there is \nsome consensus that digital influence operations can violate the principle of non-\nintervention in another state\u2019s internal affairs, achieving agreement on whether they \nhave the required coercive effect to constitute intervention has proved more prob -\nlematic ( Hollis, 2018 ; Ohlin, 2017 ; Tsagourias, 2019 ). Tallinn 2.0 defines coercion \nas \u2018an affirmative act designed to deprive another State of its freedom of choice, \n\n264  Victoria Baines\nthat is, to force that State to act in an involuntary manner or involuntarily refrain \nfrom acting in a particular way\u2019 ( Schmitt, 2017 , Rule 66). In light of this require -\nment, the efforts of researchers, lawyers and media commentators to quantify the \nimpact of Russian cyber operations on political outcomes in the United States and \nEurope are both warranted and unsurprising. On the issue of coordinated disinfor -\nmation operations, the Tallinn experts were somewhat more confident:\nWith regard to propaganda .  . . its transmission into other States is generally not \na violation of sovereignty. However, the transmission of propaganda, depend -\ning on its nature, might violate other rules of international law. For instance, \npropaganda designed to incite civil unrest in another State would likely violate \nthe prohibition of intervention.\n(Schmitt, 2017 , Rule 66)\nIn the words of the Tallinn Manual\u2019s editor, lack of clarity concerning remote \nelectoral interference \u2018comprises a normative grey zone ripe for exploitation by \nStates and non-State actors\u2019 ( Schmitt, 2018 , p. 30). Accordingly, the UN GGE has \nsought both to broaden the concept of state responsibility and to encourage clari -\nfication through international cooperation. Among the confidence-building meas -\nures proposed in the 2013 report, States are encouraged to consider developing \n\u2018enhanced mechanisms for law enforcement cooperation to reduce incidents that \ncould otherwise be misinterpreted as hostile State actions would improve interna -\ntional security\u2019 (A/68/98* IV 26.f.). The 2015 report includes within its proposed \nnorms that \u2018States should not knowingly allow their territory to be used for inter -\nnationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u2019 (A/70/174 III 13.c.).\nGiven the blurring of the distinction between state and non-state operations \nin cyberspace, the inclusion of non-state actors among the stakeholders for cyber \nnorm development is entirely appropriate. At the same time, the opinion that for -\neign disinformation operations may constitute a violation of the non-intervention \nprinciple puts corporations such as social media platforms in the unenviable posi -\ntion of facilitating violations of international law, however unwittingly. Online \nservice providers operating in multiple countries now find themselves targets and \nvectors of demonstrations of digital sovereignty.\nState Preoccupations of Digital Sovereignty\nIn the first 20  years of global internet access, countries around the world have \ngrappled with how to apply their domestic legislation to cyberspace. The principle \nthat everything accessible in a certain territory is within that territory\u2019s jurisdiction \nproves impractical unless that access can be restricted domestically. This has led to \nthe Chinese approach, the so-called Great Firewall of China, restricting access to \ninformation and services deemed ideologically undesirable; but also to the passing \nof legislation, as Russia\u2019s 2014 Information Act or \u2018Bloggers\u2019 Law\u2019, imposing data \n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  265\nsovereignty on internet content and traffic by the very fact that all web services are \nrequired to store the user data of Russian citizens on servers within the territory. In \nJune 2020, the European Court of Human Rights (2020 ) ruled that the blocking of \nwebsites failing to comply with the Act was a violation of the right to freedom of \nexpression as set out in Article 10 of the ECHR.\nThis proactive application of jurisdiction appears to be part of a wider pro -\ngram to create a national internet. The Sovereign Internet bill signed by Vladimir \nPutin in May  2019 was followed by a reportedly successful test of what is now \nbeing popularly referred to as the \u2018Sovereign Runet\u2019 \u2013 an internet capable of \nbeing disconnected from international infrastructure ( Tsydenova, 2019 ). An \ninternet that is domestically isolated can be shut down. Passed by consensus in \n2016, UN Human Rights Council resolution A/HRC/32/L.20 both \u2018recognizes \nthe global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in accelerating \nprogress towards development in its various forms\u2019 and \u2018condemns unequivo -\ncally measures to intentionally prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of \ninformation online in violation of international human rights law and calls on all \nStates to refrain from and cease such measures\u2019. Despite this, internet throttling \nand shutdowns have become tactics of choice for states. Digital rights non-profit \nAccess Now reported 213 documented shutdowns in 2019 across 33 countries, \nof which India accounted for 121 ( Taye, 2020 ). Shutdowns for political reasons \u2013  \nfor example, during elections or protests \u2013 point to their use as tools to restrict \nfreedom of expression, including that concerning human rights abuses ( Article \n19, 2020 ). Nor are they always temporary. More lengthy throttling measures, \nsuch as the 472-day ban on access to social media in Chad in 2018\u20132019, speak \nto the restriction of speech and access to information online as a persistent trend \nin many countries that do not necessarily fit into the Cold War mould of authori -\ntarian states.\nAs A/HRC/32/L.20 highlights, the designation of measures intended to disrupt \naccess to information as violations of international human rights law creates an \nadditional tension in light of digital technology\u2019s own disruptive quality. By this \nstatement the UN Human Rights Council \u2013 and more specifically the states in its \nmembership \u2013 is cast in the role of defending the disruptor (digital technology) \nagainst state disruption. As per the feedback loop outlined by Bjola and Kornprobst \nin the introduction to this volume, the inclusion of digital technology in multilateral \nhuman rights governance forces a re-shaping of intra-order relations.\nDiffering opinions over the extent to which governments should restrict access \nto the internet and its content has in turn manifested in competing proposals for \ninternational legal instruments. The global popularity of services provided by US \nand Chinese tech companies adds an additional layer of complexity. US companies \nare correctly supposed to be supportive of \u2018Western\u2019, less restrictive approaches to \ninternet regulation. As regards internet content, US platforms are protected in the \nfirst instance by the US Communications Decency Act (CDA) 1996, also known as \nSection  230, which stipulates that \u2018No provider or user of an interactive computer \n\n266  Victoria Baines\nservice shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by \nanother information content provider\u2019 (47 U.S.C. \u00a7230(c)1). The CDA also pro -\nvides \u2018Good Samaritan\u2019 protection for providers, specifically that\nany action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability \nof material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, \nfilthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not \nsuch material is constitutionally protected.\n(47 U.S.C. \u00a7230(c)2(A))\nIn this context, attempts by other national governments to exercise legal control \nover content either accessible by their citizens or using domestic infrastructure are \nas much foreign policy statements of resistance to US technological hegemony as \nthey are internal safety and security measures. While President Trump was bent on \npreventing censorship of online content, as demonstrated in a May  2020 Execu -\ntive Order, legislative instruments such as the German 2017 Network Enforcement \nAct (NetzDG) that seek to impose financial penalties for non-removal of content \ndeemed domestically illegal, including Holocaust denial, issue a clear challenge \nto US companies to choose whether they are truly global providers, or extensions \nof the US technological complex ( Delcker, 2018 ; The White House, 2020 ).3 Face -\nbook\u2019s October  2020 announcement prohibiting Holocaust denial or distortion \ncontent suggests a choice of the former.\nChinese companies such as Huawei, meanwhile, have been depicted as threats \nto national security by the United States in particular, precisely because of their \nproximity to \u2013 and alleged control by \u2013 the Chinese government ( Federal Commu -\nnications Commission, 2020 ). In this scenario, measures aimed at preserving inter -\nnal digital sovereignty are thus reactions to others\u2019 practice of external sovereignty \nin the form of techno-nationalism.\nDigital Sovereignty Versus Techno-nationalism\nThe concept of techno-nationalism pre-dates the current debate over the power \nand state proximity of the largest global tech companies ( Montresor, 2001 ). Origi -\nnally used to denote 20th-century nationalising stances towards \u2013 and rhetoric of \u2013 \nmanufacturing, oil production, aviation and innovation in general ( Edgerton, 2007 , \n2020 ), it now popularly refers to foreign policy that seeks to leverage communica -\ntions technology for a state\u2019s wider strategic aims and is often seen as a reversal \nof the tendency towards globalisation ( Capri, 2020 ; Rajan, 2018 ; World Economic \nForum, 2019 ).\nAs Otero-Iglesias notes elsewhere in this volume, the United States and China \nare the leading actors in this techno-nationalist drama. While apparently co-opted \ninto a larger trade war, the designation of Huawei as a national security threat to the \nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  267\nUnited States speaks both to the problem of attribution of cyber operations in inter -\nnational law and to digital sovereignty. Domestic Chinese cybersecurity legisla -\ntion requires network operators in the country to \u2018cooperate with cybersecurity and \ninformatization departments and relevant departments in conducting implementa -\ntion of supervision and inspections in accordance with the law\u2019 ( People\u2019s Republic \nof China, 2017 , Art. 49). Following that logic, the FBI has asserted that \u2018Beijing \ncould likely use these authorities and policies to compel access to U.S. commercial \nand sensitive personal data, including sensitive information stored or transmitted \nthrough Chinese systems\u2019 ( Wallace, 2020 ).\nA further draft security law published in July  2020 seeks to apply extraterritorial \njurisdiction on entities outside China that engage in \u2018data activities that harm the \nnational security, the public interest, or the lawful interests of citizens or organiza -\ntions of the People\u2019s Republic of China\u2019 ( People\u2019s Republic of China, 2020 , Art.2), \nand the adoption of counter-measures \u2018for any country or region that adopts dis -\ncriminatory prohibitions, limitations or other such measures toward the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China with respect to investment or trade related to data, data devel -\nopment and use, or technology\u2019 (Art.24). The identification of technology transfer \nsanctions as a security issue, and the provision in law for retaliation, epitomises \ntechno-nationalism\u2019s convolution of international relations, economic policy and \ntechnological innovation.\nPresident Trump\u2019s 2019 Executive Order prohibiting the incorporation of \n\u2018information and communications technology or services designed, developed, \nmanufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the \njurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary\u2019 is similarly techno-nationalist in \nits intent and impact ( The White House, 2019 ). Designation of such technology as \nan \u2018extraordinary threat to the national security\u2019 has also created a space in which \nto exert diplomatic pressure on other nations to remove Huawei components from \ntheir telecommunications infrastructure. While moves to effectively ban Huawei\u2019s \ninvolvement in 5G infrastructure in Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand and the \nUnited Kingdom may to some degree be seen as exercises of these countries\u2019 digi -\ntal sovereignty, concerns expressed by network providers over the resulting eco -\nnomic impact and delay to 5G rollout speak to a hampering of sovereign digital \ninnovation ( Assembly, 2019 ; Bloomberg, 2019 ).\nThe suggestion that Iran\u2019s construction of a National Information Network has \nbeen accelerated by US trade sanctions merits further consideration ( Article 19, \n2020 ; Harrell  & Anderson, 2018 ). By dint of the United States\u2019 global technologi -\ncal hegemony, US trade sanctions restrict the extent to which a country can interact \nwith globally popular platforms and online services. In this respect, the exercise \nof trade sovereignty by one state can trigger a more robust exercise of digital sov -\nereignty in another. This is not the preserve solely of authoritarian regimes, as \naborted attempts to establish \u2018sovereign clouds\u2019 and a sovereign operating system \nin France demonstrate ( Gueham, 2017 ).\n\n268  Victoria Baines\nDigital Sovereignty as Sovereign Innovation\nA somewhat less contentious conceptualisation of digital sovereignty is articu -\nlated by the European Parliament ( Madiega, 2020 ). Defining the term as \u2018Europe\u2019s \nability to act independently in the digital world\u2019, and discussing the idea in the \ncontext of an identified need for \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019, digital sovereignty is here \nconceived as a techno-regionalist Europe First policy, focused as much on the fos -\ntering of innovation and competition as on the exertion of control. Data protection \nand privacy distinguish this approach: referencing the role of US companies in \nsurveillance capitalism and invalidated arrangements for transatlantic data transfer, \nit frames digital sovereignty also as the ability of citizens to recover control over \ntheir data. Like the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), it has an \nethical flavour that refocuses governance of digital technology on citizen rights and \nopportunities ( Madiega, 2020 , p. 3).\nFor the European Parliament, technological hegemony is not solely the pre -\nserve of the United States. Chinese companies\u2019 influence is noted as a concern, \nparticularly reliance on Chinese 5G infrastructure ( Madiega, 2020 , p. 4). Among \nthe 24 possible initiatives for strengthening Europe\u2019s digital sovereignty listed are \nthe inclusion of \u2018data sovereignty\u2019 clauses in public procurement contracts, amend -\nments to GDPR and revision to the Network and Information Security (NIS) Direc -\ntive, the establishment of an EU Joint Cybersecurity Unit, common standards for \n5G and Internet of Things (IoT), legislation for ethical use of facial recognition, \nand new instruments to assess acquisitions of EU tech companies. While the pro -\nposals are ambitious, the precedent of GDPR instils hope that at least some of them \ncould be achieved. Moreover, there is every reason to expect that the European \nUnion will continue to be considered something of a model for digital govern -\nance. GDPR\u2019s impact on data processing procedures worldwide and the European \nCommission\u2019s investigations into large US tech companies\u2019 acquisitions speak to \nthe ability of the bloc to lead multilateral regulatory efforts by example ( European \nCommission, 2017 ; Scott  & Larger, 2019 ), while the recently unveiled Digital Ser -\nvices and Digital Markets Acts are already being hailed as possible blueprints for \nregulating Big Tech ( Browne, 2020 ; European Commission, 2021 ; Perrigo, 2020 ).\nRecalling the introduction to this book, we may observe that state-based efforts \nto regulate in the interest of digital sovereignty are attempts to control the very \nsources of digital disruption identified by Bjola and Kornprobst. Techno-nationalist \nand sovereign innovationist policies promote state-sanctioned datafication which is \nnecessarily less generative and spontaneous: at their most restrictive, they deter -\nmine not only how data can be used, but who can develop technology that disrupts. \nThe enforcement of censored, sovereign internet pushes back against the inherent \npervasiveness of digital disruption. Meanwhile, regulatory proposals \u2013 especially \nthose requiring international assent \u2013 challenge the speed of technological develop -\nment, decelerating by default or by design. National and some multilateral initia -\ntives have sought to apply the brakes on aspects of digital technology perceived \n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  269\nto be outside governments\u2019 effective control. More than simply aiming at rule \ncreation, they seek to \u2018regulate\u2019 also in respect of controlling the rate and extent of \ndisruption. It is perhaps unsurprising, then, that alternative, multistakeholder gov -\nernance paradigms have advocated a lighter regulatory touch, with a focus more on \nfostering responsible behaviour than on physical, logical and social control.\nAlternative Governance Paradigms\nRecent years have seen the emergence of a host of multistakeholder cyberspace \ngovernance ventures, among them the UN\u2019s Internet Governance Forum, the 2014 \nNETMundial conference, the Paris Call, the establishment of the Cyber Peace \nInstitute, and thematic initiatives, such as the Global Internet Forum to Coun -\nter Terrorism (GIFCT) and Christchurch Call to Eliminate Terrorist and Violent \nExtremist Content Online. Along with fellow technology leaders, Microsoft has \nshown its support for these as a listed sponsor of activities and/or by means of \nexplicit endorsements ( Microsoft, 2014 , 2019a , 2019b , 2019c ).\nMicrosoft\u2019s listing as a leading partner (second only to the government of The \nNetherlands) of The Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace (GCSC) \ndemonstrates the corporation\u2019s commitment to inclusive cyber norm development. \nEstablished at The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies and the East West Institute \nin 2017, the GCSC\u2019s commissioners hail from the United States, United Kingdom, \nthe European Union, Israel and Japan \u2013 opponents to the 2019 UN resolution to \nexplore a new international convention \u2013 but also from its core supporters, Russia \nand China. While on balance it is still \u2018US heavy\u2019 (8 out of 25 commissioners, and \n1 of the 2 co-chairs), the engagement of experts from the opposing governance \nideology, also from India, Nigeria, Brazil, South Africa, Singapore and Malaysia, \nmay be seen as a conscious inclusion effort.\nConvened to make specific recommendations, the GCSC\u2019s (2019 ) report identi -\nfied the following principles as equally critical to advancing cyberstability:\n\u2022 Responsibility: Everyone is responsible for ensuring the stability of cyberspace.\n\u2022 Restraint: No state or non-state actor should take actions that impair the stability \nof cyberspace.\n\u2022 Requirement to Act: State or non-state actors should take reasonable and appro -\npriate steps to ensure the stability of cyberspace.\n\u2022 Respect for Human Rights: Efforts to ensure the stability of cyberspace must \nrespect human rights and the rule of law.\nThere is much that is familiar, but also notable novelty. The principle of respon -\nsibility has a heritage in the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on \nResponsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts (International Law Com -\nmission, 2001). The Tallinn Manual 2.0 on the International Law Applicable to \nCyber Operations  continued the focus on state responsibility, asserting that \u2018A  State  \n\n270  Victoria Baines\nbears international responsibility for a cyber-related act that is attributable to the \nState and that constitutes a breach of an international legal obligation\u2019 ( Schmitt, \n2017 , Rule 14). For its part, the UN General Assembly GGE reported in 2015 \nthat \u2018While States have a primary responsibility to maintain a secure and peace -\nful ICT environment, international cooperation would benefit from the appropriate \nparticipation of the private sector, academia and civil society\u2019 (A/70/174, p.  2). The \nGCSC\u2019s (2019 , p. 18) reference to \u2018everyone\u2019 is a clear extension of responsibility \nto individuals:\nWhile it may be obvious that those responsible for government cyber policies \nand employees that manage cloud services have a role to play, every individ -\nual connected to cyberspace must take reasonable efforts to ensure their own \ndevices are not compromised and, perhaps, used in attacks.\nThe identification of shared, bottom-up responsibility as critical to ensuring the \nstability of cyberspace is a clear departure from international law\u2019s focus on state \nresponsibility. It is unclear how that shared responsibility could be reflected in any \nlegal instrument based on this principle.\nThe GCSC\u2019s application of the principle of restraint to non-state actors con -\nsciously extends the focus from the 2015 UN GGE\u2019s recommendation that states \nshould \u2018prevent ICT practices that are acknowledged to be harmful or that may \npose threats to international peace and security\u2019 (A/70/174, p.  7). The Requirement \nto Act is likewise applied to private companies and individuals. The justification for \nincluding individuals in this requirement reflects the asymmetric nature of cyber-\nattacks: \u2018individuals can ensure they are employing best practices, such as upgrad -\ning, patching, and using multifactor authentication, to reduce the risk that botnets \nwill take over their machines and then be used to launch broad-based attacks that \nthreaten the stability of cyberspace\u2019 ( Global Commission, 2019 , p. 19). The basic \ndigital hygiene of billions of citizens is presented as a critical success factor.\nMinimum compliance with the Human Rights Principle advanced requires \n\u2018that states abide by their human rights obligations under international law as they \nengage in activities in cyberspace\u2019 ( Global Commission, 2019 , p. 19). Reference is \nmade specifically to UN General Assembly resolutions 68/167 and 69/166 on The \nRight to Privacy in the Digital Age . These documents\u2019 deep concern\nat the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, \nincluding extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as \nwell as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass \nscale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights\nbetrays the difficult geopolitical climate following Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations \nin 2013 of large-scale surveillance by US authorities.\n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  271\nAccordingly, both resolutions extend to digital communication the right to pri -\nvacy enshrined in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Resolution 69/166 \ngoes further, noting\nwith deep concern  that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged \nin promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently \nface threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary \ninterference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities.\n[original emphasis]\nThe subsequent warning that \u2018while concerns about public security may justify \nthe gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure \nfull compliance with their obligations under international human rights law\u2019 high -\nlights the extent to which the widespread adoption of digital communications and \nsurveillance technologies has both heightened the tension between privacy and \nsecurity and disrupted the application of international human rights law.\nThe GCSC\u2019s proposed norms ( 2019 , p. 8) build on those adopted by the UN \nGGE in 2015 (A/70/174, p.  7). Where the latter called on states to \u2018not know -\ningly allow their territory to be used for internationally wrongful acts using ICTs\u2019, \nthe former calls on state and non-state  actors to \u2018neither conduct nor knowingly \nallow  activity that intentionally and substantially damages the general availability \nor integrity of the public core of the Internet\u2019, \u2018not pursue, support or allow  cyber \noperations intended to disrupt the technical infrastructure essential to elections, ref -\nerenda or plebiscites\u2019, and \u2018not tamper with products and services in development \nand production, nor allow them to be tampered with , if doing so may substantially \nimpair the stability of cyberspace\u2019 [emphasis added]. The GCSC\u2019s proposed norms \nalso have a more technical flavour than those of the UN GGE: state and non-state \nactors \u2018should not commandeer the general public\u2019s ICT resources for use as bot -\nnets or for similar purposes\u2019; developers should \u2018(1) prioritize security and stabil -\nity, (2) take reasonable steps to ensure that their products or services are free from \nsignificant vulnerabilities, and (3) take measures to timely mitigate vulnerabilities\u2019. \nHere, too, non-state actors have both agency and practical responsibility.\nWhile not of themselves legally binding, the GCSC\u2019s hope that these additional \nnorms should over time be adopted, implemented and serve to hold accountable \nthose who violate them ( 2019 , p. 22), highlights the role of non-state actors in \nthese activities. Special mention is made of the expanded role of the private sector \nin exposing, documenting and attributing attacks, of which Facebook\u2019s reporting \non information operations appearing to originate in Russia is a prominent exam -\nple from recent years ( Stamos, 2017 ; Weedon, Nuland,  & Stamos, 2017 ). Non-\nstate actors are also called upon to \u2018take a greater role in holding norms violators \naccountable for transgressions\u2019. Selection of the boycott of the Saudi Future Invest -\nment Initiative following the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as an example \n\n272  Victoria Baines\nof private sector norms enforcement worthy of \u2018further examination\u2019 is particularly \napposite in the context of cyberspace governance, given allegations that the Saudi \ngovernment used NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware to intercept Khashoggi\u2019s commu -\nnications ( Kirkpatrick, 2018 ). Public reporting of the 2018 hack of Amazon CEO \nJeff Bezos\u2019 mobile phone by means of a WhatsApp message apparently sent from \nthe personal account of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, and WhatsApp\u2019s lawsuit \nagainst NSO Group for compromising the accounts of its users, perhaps also serve \nas signals for how this private sector enforcement could manifest in future (Kirch -\ngaessner, 2020a, 2020b). Multilateral fora also appear to be preparing for a future \nin which the digital technology industry takes a more active role in cyberspace \ngovernance.\nNever the Twain? Microsoft at the UN, and the Open-Ended \nWorking Group\nOn 17 September  2020, Microsoft officially opened its United Nations representa -\ntion office. As its lead, John Frank, acknowledged, the establishment of such an \noffice \u2013 or perhaps rather an office that openly promotes itself as such \u2013 was an \nunprecedented step: \u2018I don\u2019t think any other company has set up an office like this, \nso I think we\u2019re the first. I  do think we\u2019re pioneering this\u2019. In a blog published to \ncoincide with the opening of the 75th session, Frank set out the corporation\u2019s pri -\norities: \u2018human rights, defending democracy, economic growth, education, broad -\nband, environmental sustainability and digital empowerment of the UN itself. At \nthe end of the day, they all roll up to global governance\u2019 ( Microsoft, 2020b ). An \nearlier statement ( Microsoft, 2020a ) serves also as a call to action:\nA series of crises have exposed the fragility of our global governance systems \nand institutions. Given the scale of challenges we face today, the need for reform \nis clear, but the international community has yet to elaborate and agree upon the \nnecessary solutions. Now is the time to think more broadly and reimagine what \neffective, inclusive global governance can do for society, and to strengthen the \nsystems and institutions that are tasked with this work.\nThe corporation\u2019s clear signal of its intention to influence global governance \u2013  \nnot merely technology governance \u2013 highlights leading technology companies\u2019 tri -\nple role in the sphere of international relations. They are at one and the same time \nthe subject of proposed regulation, service providers to state parties, and partners \nin the development and delivery of global solutions: \u2018We\u2019re not a government; we \ndon\u2019t pretend to be. There are some things that we don\u2019t get invited to, but there are \nthings that we can help with\u2019 ( Microsoft, 2020b ).\nTo coincide with the opening of the 75th session, Microsoft published white \npapers on its work towards the Sustainable Development Goals, and the issue of \nDigital Peace in Cyberspace ( Art & Emejulu, 2020a , 2020b ). These were by no \n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  273\nmeans its first forays into advocacy for international law: in 2017, its President, \nBrad Smith, announced the publication of the corporation\u2019s policy paper advancing \na Digital Geneva Convention to protect cyberspace ( Microsoft, 2017 ). The corpo -\nration\u2019s increasingly active participation in the cyberspace governance debate has \nnot gone unnoticed. Identifying Microsoft as falling into Finnemore and Hollis\u2019 \n(2016 ) category of \u2018norm entrepreneur\u2019, an actor who may \u2018frame the issue, articu -\nlate the norm, and organize support\u2019, Hurel and Lobato (2018 ) conclude that\nNot only does the company focus on changing the behaviour of states regarding \nglobal cybersecurity norms, but also seeks to stretch its own legitimacy beyond \ntechnical and economic services to influence international diplomatic efforts at \nthe forefront of global cybersecurity debates.4\nMeanwhile, following the failure of the 2016/2017 GGE process there are indi -\ncations that a parallel multilateral deliberative process is proving more promising. \nThe UN General Assembly\u2019s 2018 decision to convene an Open Ended Working \nGroup (OEWG) on developments in the field of information and telecommunica -\ntions in the context of international security had among its stated objectives \u2018mak -\ning the United Nations negotiation process on security in the use of information \nand communications technologies more democratic, inclusive and transparent\u2019, \nand \u2018to further develop the rules, norms and principles of responsible behav -\niour of States .  . . and the ways for their implementation\u2019 on a consensus basis  \n(A/RES/73/27). Meeting throughout 2019 and 2020, the OEWG process suc -\nceeded in engaging a larger number of states than the more restrictive member -\nship of the GGE. China, Cuba, India, Iran, the Non-Aligned Movement, Pakistan \nand others contributed written submissions on specific language proposals for \nrules, norms and principles ( United Nations General Assembly, 2021a ).5 These \nreveal familiar preoccupations, among them a Chinese focus on sovereignty and \nsuggested text aimed at countering US tech dominance: \u2018States should not exploit \ntheir dominant position in ICTs, including dominance in resources, critical ICT \ninfrastructures and core technologies, ICT goods and services to undermine other \nstates\u2019 right to independent control of ICT goods and services as well as their secu -\nrity\u2019; but also the apparent emergence of new leadership, evidenced for example \nin Canada\u2019s extensive contribution on practical guidance for norm implementa -\ntion. The process has therefore been a much needed demonstration and restate -\nment of the principle of sovereign equality enshrined in the UN Charter.\nThe OEWG has also succeeded in engaging numerous non-state actors in \nintersessional consultation, including IGOs, NGOs, Microsoft and Russian cyber -\nsecurity firm Kaspersky.6 While inviting industry opinion on matters of cyberspace \ngovernance is itself nothing new, the inclusion in the process of an opportunity for \nthem to both comment on the group\u2019s reporting, and even suggest new norms and \nconfidence building measures, is evidence of a growing acceptance of technol -\nogy providers\u2019 role as norm entrepreneurs. So, Microsoft\u2019s dual written submission \n\n274 Victoria Baines\n(2020c , 2020d ) advocates for the establishment of a repository on national state -\nments on the applicability of international law to cyberspace, confidence building \nmeasures (CBMs), capacity building and new norms, and affirms \u2018the vital role of \nthe United Nations\u2019: in addition to new norms and CBMs, Kaspersky (2020 ) rec-\nommends the development of a consensus-based lexicon of terminology relevant to \nICT governance. The deliberations of the OEWG thus have something of a hybrid \nquality, employing a multistakeholder process to deliver multilateral responses. To \ndraw on the framing used at the start of this book, by reflecting the multiplex real -\nity of the cyberspace governance community, they acknowledge the reconfiguring \nof its ordering processes. Perhaps because they resist neat categorisation as sover -\neigntist/statist OR (US-backed) multistakeholder, they arguably represent the most \npromising current initiative in international cyberspace law.\nConcluding Thoughts, Future Outlook\nAssessments of international law, and indeed multilateralism, as in crisis over cyber -\nspace are attractive and familiar: notions of deadlock speak to Cold War divisions \nbetween control and freedom that to some extent map to sovereigntist/statist and \nmultistakeholder paradigms for cyberspace governance.7 But this overlooks the \nmultipolarity of states\u2019 positions on digital technology: a close reading of the zero \ndraft of the OEWG report and analysis of state voting patterns reveals preoccupa -\ntions of digital sovereignty that are as much about resisting US technological hegem -\nony and designations of cyberspace as a conflict zone as about controlling internet \ncontent and access. When even the multistakeholder paradigm is eyed with suspi -\ncion as an engine of US influence, the need for a truly inclusiv e approach is clear.\nThere is cause for those dejected by the failure of the 2016/2017 GGE process \nto be cautiously optimistic: the engagement of many more states in the OEWG \nprocess, and the extension of at least informal participation to the private sector \nand civil society, suggests that there is renewed hope for multiateral regulation \nwith multistakeholder influence. Microsoft\u2019s rationale for establishment at the UN \naligns with this paradigm: while it is not unprecedented, the extent to which corpo -\nrations have publicly taken a lead in shaping legal and non-binding norms may be, \nthe comparative speed at which technology providers can respond mirroring that \nof urban networks as observed by Ashbrook elsewhere in this volume. Both these \ndevelopments align with the view expressed by Kornprobst and Bjola in the intro -\nduction to this volume that digital disruption, through datafication, its speed and \nits pervasiveness, reconfigures traditional agential and ordering processes in inter -\nnational relations, and demands new foreground institutions for their deliberation.\nThat is not to say that the long-term future of cyberspace governance is any \nmore certain or clear. France\u2019s call in October  2020 for a Programme of Action to \nend the dual track discussions in the GGE and OEWG, and establish \u2018a permanent \nUN forum to consider the use of ICTs by States in the context of international \nsecurity\u2019, backed by 43 states from five continents, may indicate frustration with \n\nDigital Technologies, Governance and International Law  275\nthe \u2018messiness\u2019 of multilateral deliberations, and also growing consensus of the \nneed for greater order ( UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, 2020 ). According to \nanother line of thinking, multiple initiatives may help generate greater consensus \nand norm-setting momentum: in Joseph Nye\u2019s (2018 , p. 25) words, \u2018at this stage, \nmany homes may be better than one or none\u2019.\nNye\u2019s (2014 ) mapping of a \u2018regime complex\u2019 for cyberspace governance is a \nhelpful hermeneutic for appreciating the already crowded (multi)stakeholder envi -\nronment and the potential impact of fostering norms in multiple fora simultane -\nously. Separating cyberspace governance into sub-issues of internet governance, \ncyber conflict, responsible behaviour in peacetime, criminal investigation and the \nlike risks generating misalignment and difficulties in implementation, as the EU \nhas already experienced in matters relating to the ability of corporations to detect \nillegal content under the European Electronic Communications Code ( European \nParliament, 2020 ); nevertheless, it breaks the issue into more manageable pieces, \nand allows for acceleration by means of cross-fertilisation.\nThanks to the disruptive speed of its development, digital technology is always \nnovel. Increasing calls for regulation of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including lethal \nautonomous weapons systems (LAWS), only serve to highlight the urgency of \nestablishing international consensus on the lawful use of digital technology. For \nall that regulatory responses lag behind, a few months can be a long time in inter -\nnational relations, particularly when a leading power undergoes regime change. \nAt the time of writing (early 2021) there is considerable speculation on President \nBiden\u2019s cybersecurity policy, and his stance towards Russia and China. However \nthe US proceeds in cyberspace governance deliberations, greater synergy between \nmultilateral and multistakeholder efforts embodied by the UN OEWG and Micro -\nsoft\u2019s activities suggest the emergence of a practical way out of the deadlock, one \nthat may succeed precisely because it challenges established notions of who should \nbe at the table, and how they should contribute. Scholarly and stakeholder hopes \nhave been dashed several times before: nevertheless, there are signs that we may \nbe starting to see the end of the beginning.\nNotes\n 1 While perhaps the best-known, Barlow\u2019s piece is by no means the earliest exploration of \nthis legal status: see, for example, Trotter Hardy (1994 ).\n 2 See also Henderson (2015 ) and Tikk-Ringas (2016 ).\n 3 \u2018What Mark Zuckerberg wishes or demands for the American or international market \nis not possible in Germany\u2019: German Justice Ministry spokesperson, quoted in Delcker \n(2018 ).\n 4 For Microsoft\u2019s role in international norm creation, see also Fairbank (2019 ).\n 5 See also now the group\u2019s final report (United Nations General Assembly, 2021b ) and \nChair\u2019s summary (United Nations General Assembly, 2021c ), both issued March  2021.\n 6 A full list of state and non-state contributions can be found at https://www.un.org/disar  \nmament/open-ended-working-group/  (accessed 14 March  2021).\n 7 See Ma\u010d\u00e1k (2017 ) for a systematic discussion of the relevant crisis indicators.\n\n276 Victoria Baines\nReferences\nArt, J.-Y .,  & Emejulu, D.

With international relations \nbecoming increasingly digitalised, we need to reflect on how a \u2018digital turn\u2019 in IR, \nwhich is already underway, is to change our discipline. This chapter makes a case \nfor moving from IR to Digital International Relations (DIR).\nDigital international relations have been steadily building up for decades \nalready. The arrival of a new generation of algorithmic-driven digital technolo -\ngies has added momentum to efforts seeking to theoretically amend and re-code \nthe \u2018old\u2019 IR in response to the disruptive impact of digital technologies. This book \nstudied digital international relations, defined as the disruptive interplay of digital \ntechnologies and power structures in global politics responsible for altering onto -\nlogical foundations of agency, shaping hybrid patterns of conflict and cooperation, \nand streaming the formation of new international political orders. Drawing on this \ndefinition, we proposed a digital disruption map to study the crisscrossing of tech -\nnological, agential and ordering processes.\nThe definition and the map are deliberately broad and eclectic as we seek to \nencourage IR scholars to step out of their conceptual comfort zone and explore new \nvocabularies (see discussion below on upgrading, augmenting and rewiring the \nIR discipline) that promise to better capture the (meta-)theoretical underpinnings \nof DIR. At the same time, our framework highlights critical elements of continu -\nity between IR and DIR. For as much as agential and ordering processes change \namidst digital disruption, they remain key analytical categories for studying digi -\ntal international relations. This can help chart the (meta-)theoretical highways on \nwhich DIR is expected to travel.CONCLUSION\nUpgrading, Augmenting and Rewiring \nthe\u00a0Discipline\nCorneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\n\n284  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nThis conclusion is organised into five sections. First, we summarise the main \nfindings of the individual chapters. Second, we point to signposts for how to travel \nfrom IR to DIR. Third, we illustrate these signposts by discussing the study of \nartificial intelligence. Fourth, we discuss what signposts might be most promising \nto be put to use in scholarly research. Fifth, we reflect upon how the transforma -\ntion from IR to DIR is likely to change \u2013 and ought to change \u2013 the ways we study \nworld politics.\nSummary\nThe speed and pervasiveness of datafication do not automatically remake interna -\ntional relations. Our digital disruption map puts agential processes at the centre. It \nis political agents who let their doings be infused by digital technological processes \nor who pro-actively introduce the latter to the former. Some entries of digitally \ndisrupted agential processes, coming to be used over and over, even come to sedi -\nment into ordering processes. Agential and ordering processes then feed back to \ntechnological processes, adding to sources of digital disruption.\nThe contributors to this book show that such a nuanced view of how digital \nelements come to reconfigure international relations is warranted, indeed. On the \none hand, they concur that the digital transformation of international relations is \nvery much happening. No matter from what theoretical angle our authors look at \nthis evolutionary change and no matter what functional order of international rela -\ntions they put under scrutiny, they find evidence for the digital transformation of \nworld politics. This prompts Harknett to revisit the core assumptions of realism, \nDrieschova and Hall to broaden the research agenda on transnational social move -\nments, as well as Kello, Cl\u00fcver-Ashbrook, Aradau, Giacomello and Eriksson to \nrevisit questions about who has political efficacy in international politics.\nOn the other hand, the contributions highlight that digital disruption finds its \nway into agential and ordering processes to varying degrees. At times, agential \nprocesses are affected but not ordering ones. Baines demonstrates that international \nactors discuss more and more how what sources of digital disruption are to re-\nshape world politics. There are important debates about digital sovereignty and \ncyber-governance. From a legal point of view, however, these discussions rarely \nmake a difference in re-ordering international relations. Since the agential pro -\ncesses, shaped by clashing views about how to order digital affairs, are highly \ncontested, they barely affect ordering processes. Digital international law remains \nin its infancy. Hall\u2019s contention is about how digital disruption makes it into agen -\ntial and ordering processes, but the ordering effects remain mostly confined to the \ndomestic level. Researching online advocacy movements, she qualifies that these \nmovements campaign first and foremost within state borders. They are actually \nless transnational in nature than they are often assumed to be. With the campaigns \nfocusing more on the state than deterritorialised space, their potential to re-make \n\nConclusion  285\norder is greater within states. Their potential to re-make international order, by \ncontrast is more limited.\nMost contributors contend that it is not only agential but also international \nordering processes that come to be reconfigured by digital disruption. Adapting key \nconcepts of international relations theory to digital international relations, Hark -\nnett, Kello and Otero-Iglesias contend that digital disruption fundamentally trans -\nforms ordering processes. Harknett moves from a traditional realist understanding \nof international politics as struggle for power to a novel one of international politics \nas struggle for autonomy among states. While reminding us that states continue to \nbe important actors in world politics, Kello alludes to different kinds of actors and \nthe \u2018new balance of players\u2019 that ensues in international politics. Otero-Iglesias \ndraws from Strange\u2019s conceptualisation of four dimensions of power (security, pro -\nduction, finance and knowledge) as structuring forces in world politics and address \nhow a particular knowledge dimension, that is, digital know-how, reconfigures \nworld order. Zooming in on the individual level of analysis, Giacomello and Eriks -\nson echo this structural argument. Individuals with plenty of digital expertise, espe -\ncially knowledge about how to design algorithms, make for a new kind of powerful \nactor, capable of shaping domestic and international orders. They refer to this kind \nof power as \u2018nerd power\u2019.\nA number of contributions deal with a particular aspect of new background \nordering, that is, the re-making of the institution of diplomacy. Holmes and \nWheeler inquire in-depth into how digital conferencing tools such as Zoom affect \nthe interaction of diplomats. They contend that, while the production and repro -\nduction of trust are possible even in digital encounters, the latter results in thin -\nner social bonds than physical encounters do. Thus, it becomes more difficult for \ndiplomacy to fulfil its ordering functions. Cl\u00fcver-Ashbrook elaborates on new dip -\nlomatic actors. Global cities find it easier and easier to connect to one another and, \ntherefore, metrodiplomacy is becoming a feature of international order. Studying \nthe logic of connectivity, Drieschova contends that digital infrastructure has the \npotential to empower even low-tech individuals such as Greta Thunberg. Note that \nCl\u00fcver-Ashbrook\u2019s and Drieschova\u2019s chapters echo a point made by Kello, Otero-\nIglesias as well as Giacomello and Eriksson. To a considerable extent, digital dis -\nruption re-shuffles agential possibilities.\nWhile the interplay of technological, agential and ordering processes is not all \nabout radical change, some dimensions of it are. Aradau\u2019s chapter underlines such \nfar-reaching transformations. She traces the evolution of non-human agency (artifi -\ncial intelligence) and discusses how the interplay of human and non-human agency \ncomes to re-shape international ordering processes. Focusing on the international \nsecurity order, she argues that agential changes have major effects on ordering \nprocesses. In the security field, the new paradigm of anticipatory security is in the \nmaking. And this may only be the beginning of even deeper ordering changes pro -\nduced by the emergence of non-human and hybrid forms of agency.\n\n286  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nThe remainder of this conclusion looks ahead into the future of the discipline. \nWhat do our findings mean for studying international relations? Tackling this ques -\ntion, we outline a \u2018digital turn\u2019 in International Relations. We reflect on how to \nmove from IR to DIR.\nThe Digital Turn: Signposts for Travelling From IR to DIR\nCalls for new \u2018turns\u2019 in IR are inevitably controversial as they raise ambitious \nmeta-theoretical questions to challenge what is deemed to constitute the \u2018main -\nstream\u2019 of IR. As Baele and Bettiza (2020 ) point out, the impact of these \u2018turns\u2019 is \nmore likely to be felt at the \u2018margins\u2019 of the discipline, often resulting in the frag -\nmentation of IR and the formation of \u2018camp\u2019 mentalities.\nWe seek to pre-empt these epistemic hazards by advancing two interrelated \nqualifications about what a \u2018digital turn\u2019, in our view, entails and ought to accom -\nplish. First, partly borrowing from Garfinkel (1981 , p. 7) we refer to the \u2018digital \nturn\u2019 as problem-driven explanatory and normative frame of enquiry for studying \ndigital international relations rather than a meta-theoretical project. As the contri -\nbutions to this volume cogently illustrate, the frame is broad enough to inspire a \nvibrant research agenda for DIR without falling into the traps of narrowly confined  \n(meta-)theoretical pigeonholes. Second, comparing with its predecessors, the \nobjective of the \u2018digital turn\u2019 has little to do with the ambition to establish a new \nschool of thought, alongside or in competition with traditional IR \u2018-isms\u2019. The pur -\npose of the \u2018digital turn\u2019 is rather to stimulate an engaging conversation across  IR \ntraditions. It draws on their theoretical and methodological richness, while remain -\ning agnostic about their ontological and epistemological assumptions, to examine \nthe future of international politics in the digital age.\nThat being said, what are the roads available to us to travel from IR to DIR? \nPutting it into metaphorical language borrowed from informational technology, we \nidentify three signposts that may help us to orient ourselves: upgrading, augment -\ning and rewiring.\nUpgrading  is akin to adding new software to the existing hardware of IR. If we \nstayed with upgrading, it would suffice to add digital aspects to existing approaches \nin the discipline. Textbook distinctions between, say, Realism, Liberalism and \nConstructivism or Critical Theory and Poststructuralism, would remain intelligible \nas vehicles for mapping contestation within the field. Upgrading could be done \nin different ways. To use Lakatos\u2019s (1970) categories on research programs, one \nway could simply be to add auxiliary hypotheses to protect the core an existing \nresearch program such as Realism. Such hypotheses could then take care of extend -\ning the conceptual focus on security to cyber-security, military capabilities to digi -\ntal capabilities, and, in the case of classical realism at least, diplomacy to digital \ndiplomacy.1 While we do not dismiss this option, we do want to point out that Laka -\ntos would be sceptical about it. It would signify to him that the research program \n\nConclusion  287\nis degenerative. A  more promising variant of upgrading would be to re-visit the \ncore of a research program ( Elman  & Elman, 2003 , p. 28; Lakatos, 1970 ). This is \nexactly what Harknett does in this book. He moves from a struggle for power to a \nstruggle for autonomy of states.\nAugmenting  is about more fundamental changes to studying world politics. It is, \nto stay with the metaphor, about both new hardware and software. In the same way \nthat digital augmentation transforms perceptions of reality by rendering data into \nreal-world objects, DIR augmentation alters and expands the field of view by which \nto study international politics. The idea of hybridity is a good example. As a dis -\ncipline focused on examining the systemic impact of physical  interactions among \ninternational actors, the growing prevalence of virtual  interactions has the potential \nto be highly disruptive. Current discussions regarding the role of avatars and digital \nhumans as new vectors of social interaction suggest that the impact of these virtual \ninteractions could be significant ( Bjola, 2023 ; Freeman, Zamanifard, Maloney,  & \nAdkins, 2020 ; Renieris, 2023 ). Unlike the upgrading dimension which seeks to \nsolve IR puzzles using traditional and new concepts, the augmentation signpost is \nmore about expanding the epistemic horizon that the digital sphere superimposes \non the IR logic of inquiry of global ordering processes. The epistemic logic of these \ninvestigations thus relates less to their ability to generate digital \u2018problemshifts\u2019 in \nIR or to protect its \u2018hard core\u2019 of assumptions from digital incursions, but rather \nto their capacity to \u2018shake up\u2019 the reflexive intuitions that can shed light on the \nproduction of IR knowledge ( Hamati-Ataya, 2013 , pp. 685\u2013686). Put differently, \naugmenting invites us to reflect upon what it means to theorise IR through a digital \nlens. What novel DIR methodological and empirical questions can be envisaged if \ndigital IR research takes the centre stage, and in what ways may their new-found \nvisibility reflexively inform our approaches to studying international relations? \nFinally , rewiring  engages with the ethical ramifications that digital technologies \nextend to processes of global ordering. Depending on the preferred theoretical per -\nspective, digital technologies are viewed as either the \u2018great equalizer\u2019 ( Xiao, 2020 ; \nUnited Nations, 2019 ) or (increasingly) the \u2018great divider\u2019 of political, social and \neconomic opportunities ( McCarthy, 2016 ; Shejni, 2019 ; Zuboff, 2019 ). Either way, \ndigital technologies are about to usher in an era of intensive and extensive contesta -\ntion of the rules, norms and principles informing agential and global ordering pro -\ncesses. These normative contestations may overlap and amplify pre-existing battles \nfor influence in world politics ( Bettiza  & Lewis, 2020 ). At the same time, they are \nalso likely to invite new modes of formal, social and cultural validation of posi -\ntions and issues on digital governance ( Wiener, 2017a , p. 121), as current debates \non digital sovereignty and cyber security already suggest. The \u2018digital turn\u2019 is thus \nbound to lay bare the sites, issues, and forms of normative contestation that digital \ndisruption has activated in global politics and to stimulate novel ethical reflections \nabout the conditions that can mitigate and possibly dissolve some of the emerging \nnormative tensions and conflicts.\n\n288  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nAn Illustration: Artificial Intelligence and International Relations\nArtificial intelligence (AI), which refers to the design and use of intelligent sys -\ntems able to simulate human reasoning and/or behaviour by applying sophisticated \nalgorithms to process large volumes of data ( High-Level Expert Group on Artificial \nIntelligence, 2019 , p. 6), is the technology with the strongest disruptive potential \nin international relations. It closely embraces and amplifies all three major sources \nof digital disruption discussed in this volume: datafication, speed and pervasive -\nness. While the quest for Artificial Intelligence has gone through multiple \u2018seasons \nof hope and despair\u2019 in the past decades ( Bostrom, 2014 , pp.  6\u201311), there is a \ngrowing consensus that the current stage of AI development is qualitatively differ -\nent. Owing to the fast-paced development of complex machine and deep learning \nalgorithms, AI applications have now reached the point at which they can learn on \ntheir own using statistical models and neural-like networks without being explic -\nitly programmed. This allows state and non-state actors to process large volumes of \ndata, extremely fast and in a pervasive manner that reaches deep into the fabric of \ndomestic and international politics. AI disruption is therefore the next big test for \nIR but theorising about it could be challenging. This is where the upgrading, aug -\nmenting or rewiring signposts could prove enlightening as they are well configured \nto provide viable conceptual roadmaps.\nAs mentioned earlier, the upgrading signpost  is about adding digital aspects \nto existing approaches in the IR discipline based on the formula \u2018take IR con -\ncept X and add AI\u2019. Current research examining the broader ramifications of AI in \nworld politics largely falls in this category. A  significant fraction of these studies \npredictably focuses on military-strategic aspects involving the changing charac -\nter of warfare or the AI impact on international stability ( Horowitz et  al., 2018 ; \nJohnson, 2020 ). AI is expected, for instance, to increase a nation\u2019s military power \nby decreasing the amount of resources and time required to conduct intelligence, \nsurveillance and reconnaissance and to wage twenty-first-century political war -\nfare. However, its ability to produce disruptive change is likely to face limitations \ndue to various constraints, including institutional integration and decision-making \ncalculations ( Jensen, Whyte,  & Cuomo, 2020 ). What is less clear is the impact \nthat AI might have on the foundations of international order. For some, the AI \nrace is already underway triggered by great powers\u2019 drive to secure a \u2018first-mover \nadvantage\u2019, and this could have large-scale consequences for the global balance \nof power. At the same time, the outcome remains uncertain, not least because AI\u2019s \nimpact is likely to be shaped by how people and organisations use the technology \nrather than by the technology itself ( Horowitz, 2018 , p. 54).\nThe picture to emerge from existing national security studies is that the \u2018upgrad -\ning\u2019 is yet to move beyond the technological level. AI\u2019s potential is being mapped \nand potential conditions that can open or close agential processes are being exam -\nined as the ongoing debate about the global ramifications of ChatGPT illustrates \n(Mu\u00f1oz  & Torreblanca, n.d. ; Rotman, 2023 ) The difficulty of understanding the \n\nConclusion  289\nbroader impact of AI on international order stems from the fact that the move \nfrom agential to ordering processes is yet to be theoretically \u2018upgraded\u2019. This \nsituation does not only affect the national security domain. Studies examining \nthe impact of AI in diplomacy and foreign policy or in international development \nhave exposed a similar pattern, albeit with slight variations. AI is expected, for \ninstance, to prompt MFAs and embassies to radically rethink their approaches to \nconsular affairs, crisis management, public diplomacy and international negotia -\ntions, but the broader impact of these transformations on foreign policy remains \nunclear ( Bjola, 2020 ). While current studies have made good progress in examin -\ning the potential contributions of AI to achieving sustainable development goals \n(Vinuesa et  al., 2020 ) and identifying potential disruptive challenges ( Goralski  & \nTan, 2020 ; McDuie\u2010Ra  & Gulson, 2020 ), the conditions for understanding the \nbroader ramifications of global development are yet to be deciphered as well \n(Bjola, 2022 ). As AI technology continues to evolve, we should therefore expect \nDIR \u2018upgrading\u2019 to fill ever more theoretical gaps in the digital flow connect -\ning agential to ordering processes and analysing their feedback effect on digital \ndisruption.\nWhile upgrading is all about adding digital conceptual software to the IR \nhardware, the augmenting  signpost features a more ambitious agenda. It seeks \nto expand the epistemic field of view by which international politics is stud -\nied. This involves not just new conceptual lenses but also novel methodological \ntools. Computational methods have established a presence in a variety of social \nscience disciplines, including sociology ( Edelmann, Wolff, Montagne,  & Bail,  \n2020 ) and communication studies ( Theocharis  & Jungherr , 2021 ), although sur -\nprisingly less so in IR.2 In their original manifesto, more than a decade ago, Lazer \net al. powerfully argued that a new field, \u2018computational social science\u2019 (CSS) \nwas emerging which leveraged \u2018the capacity to collect and analyse data with an \nunprecedented breadth and depth and scale\u2019 ( Lazer et  al., 2009 , p. 722). Their call \nwas echoed by other scholars, who agreed that the unprecedented availability of \ninformation on discrete behaviours, social expressions, personal connections and \nsocial alignments promised to revolutionise research in social sciences ( Shah, \nCappella,  & Neuman, 2015 ). CSS is believed to be particularly well suited for \nbuilding \u2018virtual computational social worlds\u2019 that researchers can use to ana -\nlyse, experiment with, feed with and test against empirical data on a hitherto \nunprecedented scale. It is also useful for studying the process of emergence of \nnovel social phenomena where individual intentions produce unexpected aggre -\ngate results, sometimes with potentially disastrous consequences ( Conte et  al., \n2012 , pp. 333\u2013335).\nIn essence, CSS combines a wide range of computational methods, including \ndata mining, data visualisation, natural language processing, automated text analy -\nsis, web scraping, geospatial analysis, social network analysis and machine learn -\ning to link macro levels of theories on social and cultural change to microlevel \nprocesses of decision making. What differentiates CSS from other approaches in \n\n290  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nthe social sciences is the combination of cross-disciplinary methodological innova -\ntions driven by the availability of new types of data or by data of a different scale \nthan has been previously possible (Alvarez, 2016, p.  5). CSS features two main \nversions that broadly align themselves yet seek to transcend discussions regarding \nthe contributions of deductive vs inductive approaches to science ( Epstein, 1999 ). \nThe most visible version, which is referred to as \u2018social science at scale\u2019, is data \ndriven and emphasises Big Data analytics in order to find patterns, structure, and \nanomalies within increasingly large and live data. The less discussed CSS version, \nalso known as \u2018bottom-up\u2019 or \u2018generative social science\u2019, emphasises modelling \nand simulation based on processes of decision-making to occur via individual and \ngroup interactions ( Frank, 2017 , p. 580).\nFrom an AI perspective, CSS can contribute to augmenting the study of digi -\ntal IR by refining current methods and developing new approaches for tracing \nand explaining the emergence of agential and ordering processes. Drawing on \nthe Agent-Based Models (ABM) literature ( De Marchi  & Page, 2014 ), the \u2018gen -\nerative\u2019 CSS approach could be applied, for instance, to map out the \u2018basins of \nattraction\u2019 and the equilibrium distributions that may inform agential and order -\ning processes. Research in both areas can build on the ABM literature on politi -\ncal decision-  making ( Qiu & Phang, 2020 ), social integration ( Schelling, 1971 ; \nSert, Bar-Yam,  & Morales, 2020 ), as well as on more conventional ABM stud -\nies examining the formation of norms and world order ( Cioffi-Revilla, 2017 ). \nComputational ABM models could shed light, for instance, on the conditions by \nwhich AI can affect the structure of incentives informing actors\u2019 forcing, enticing, \nand winning-over strategies. As AI continues to evolve from \u2018narrow\u2019 to faster \n(\u2018speed superintelligence\u2019), more synchronised (\u2018collective superintelligence\u2019), \nand smarter (\u2018quality superintelligence\u2019) forms ( Bostrom, 2014 , pp.  63\u201369), \nDIR researchers could also develop models of regional or global ordering. These \nmodels would involve data-driven analysis of the type of agents, environmental \nconfigurations and sequence of interactions that may shape cooperative versus \ncompetitive behaviour and facilitate the emergence of new institutions to address \nchallenges generated by AI proliferation.\nWithin the context of AI revolution, the third signpost, rewiring , has attracted \nunusual public and academic attention and for good reasons. The pervasive \nentrenchment of choice-inducing algorithms in almost every aspect of human life \nhas fuelled concerns about human agency being gradually transformed by power -\nful AI techniques to the extent that people may lose their capacity for autonomous \ndecision-making and turn instead into mere \u2018choosing subjects\u2019 ( Kotliar, 2021 ). \nFrom a broader perspective, AI is perceived to alter the landscape of security risks \nfor citizens, organisations and states by expanding on existing threats, introduc -\ning new threats, or modifying the typical character of threats. Malicious use of AI \ncould threaten, for instance, digital security by lowering barriers for hacking and \ncyberattacks, physical security by increasing the scale of attacks via networks of \n\nConclusion  291\nautonomous systems, and political security through privacy-eliminating surveil -\nlance, profiling and repression, or through automated and targeted disinformation \ncampaigns ( Brundage et  al., 2018 ). Managing these risks is not easy as the race for \nAI supremacy creates a complex ecology of choices that could push stake-holders \nto underestimate or even ignore ethical and safety procedures ( Han, Pereira, San -\ntos, & Lenaerts, 2020 ).\nThe AI \u2018rewiring\u2019 challenge for IR is well illustrated by the \u2018Collingridge \nDilemma\u2019: although new technology can be best controlled in its early stages, \nnot enough can be known about its harmful social consequences at this stage; by \nthe time these consequences are apparent, control has become costly and slow \n(Collingridge, 1980 , p. 19). Overcoming the \u2018Collingridge Dilemma\u2019  is not easy. \nIt requires a precautionary approach and the reinforcement of responsibilities in \nresearch and innovation rather than the attenuation of accountabilities ( Genus  & \nStirling, 2018 , p. 67). In the context of digital IR, this translates into a quest for \ndesigning innovative ethical frameworks to oversee agential and ordering pro -\ncesses. On the agential part, good progress has been made in designing recom -\nmendations to support the adoption of ethically accountable AI applications, such \nas the five core principles of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, justice and \nexplicability (Floridi  & Cowls, 2019). On the ordering part, the AI for Social Good \n(AI4SG) movement has set out to build support for the design, development and \ndeployment of AI systems in ways that help prevent, mitigate and resolve problems \nadversely affecting human and natural life without introducing new forms of harm \nor amplifying existing disparities and inequities (Cowls, Tsamados, Taddeo,  & \nFloridi, 2021, p.  112).\nIn the short and medium term, the most likely challenge for the normative rewir -\ning of IR will be AI-driven digital authoritarianism. The latter refers to \u2018the use \nof digital information technology by authoritarian regimes to surveil, repress, and \nmanipulate domestic and foreign populations\u2019 ( Polyakova  & Meserole, 2019 , p. 1), \nand it has the power to rewire IR at both the level of agential and ordering pro -\ncesses. Recent studies suggest that the ongoing trend witnessing the use of digital \ntechnologies in support of political repression rather than democratisation ( R\u00f8d & \nWeidmann, 2015 ) is likely to accelerate and AI is the driving factor that could tilt \nthe disruptive \u2018needle\u2019 further on the digital authoritarian side ( Dragu  & Lupu, \n2021 ). The implications for the global order could be far reaching. Digital author -\nitarianism will likely bolster the power of existing authoritarian states, encour -\nage semi-democratic states to adopt authoritarian models and further weaken the \ndomestic and international standing of democratic states ( Sherman, 2021 ). From a \nDIR \u2018rewiring\u2019 perspective, ethical questions concerning the mechanisms and poli -\ncies by which agential and ordering processes can be fine-tuned to arrest and derail \nthe rise of digital authoritarianism would become critically important. As this final \nchapter suggests, the time to reflect upon and address these questions could not \ncome soon enough.\n\n292  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nWhich Signposts to Put to Use?\nWhile we think that there is added value in putting to use any of these signposts for \nmoving towards DIR, we would caution against prioritising upgrading and neglect -\ning augmenting and rewiring. These signposts point into directions that do not \ncome all that natural to most IR scholars but they are vital for making sense of \ndigital international relations.\nOne would expect upgrading to dominate research in DIR, at least in the initial \nstage. In recent decades, the field has split up into more and more approaches, sub-\nfields and niches. It comes more natural to many IR scholars to upgrade the \u2018allot -\nment\u2019 they have chosen or socialised into than to direct their gaze at the entire field \n(Grieco, 2019 ; Kornprobst, 2009 ). We are somewhat sceptical whether this is likely \nto change in DIR any time soon. Scholars are likely to continue to put their (often \nhabitual) lenses to use. Whatever digital aspects they see through these lenses may \nprompt them to amend existing concepts, hypotheses and/or lines of critique. As \nsuggested by the contributions to this volume, the security and military domains \nare the most likely IR arenas to undergo digital upgrading, but studies of political \neconomy, foreign policy and environmental governance are moving fast to close \nthe upgrading gap.\nAugmenting does not come easy to IR scholarship. It would require a reflexive \nperspective on the production of IR knowledge, the preparedness to leave one\u2019s \nallotment behind, and daring to think outside of the box. Yet we would submit \nthat this kind of methodological expansion of the current state of the art and mov -\ning beyond it would be important for the discipline\u2019s explanatory power. Con -\nsider Aradau\u2019s discussion of hybrid and even non-human agency in this book, for \nexample. These new kinds of agency make for micro-foundations that are out of \nsync with any IR paradigm. We would hope that scholarly engagements with such \npronounced qualitative breaks in how world politics is done will prompt scholars \nbuilding bridges across different paradigms and disciplines (including overcoming \nthe schism between the \u2018hard\u2019 and \u2018soft\u2019 sciences).3 Computational social science \ncould provide such a methodological bridge as Big Data analytics or Agent-Based \nModelling can help us better understand the emergence of agential and ordering \nprocesses. Otherwise, it will be difficult to rise to the major conceptual challenges \nlying ahead of us.\nRewiring does not come easy either. Normative research in the discipline is \nalso split up into a range of different approaches. Thus, normative theorising is \nunlikely to be a major exception to a prevailing trend to update. Yet, again, only \nupgrading today\u2019s contending normative approaches will probably not do. The map \nwe developed in the introduction, for example, is meant to facilitate upgrading \nas well as rewiring. But how many normative theories link up the evolution of \ntechnological, agential and ordering processes? Approaches more tending towards \ncosmopolitanism come down quite heavily on the agential side and more com -\nmunitarian ones more on the ordering side. But the technological processes, save \n\nConclusion  293\nfor very few exceptions ( Cheah, 2006 ; Drieschova, 2021 ; Thorpe, 2008 ), remain \nexcluded. Bringing these into the orbit of normative theorising as well as balancing \nagency and order in light of these technological processes appear to us important \nsteps for moving normative international theory forward. This is badly needed. \nThere are quite a few political debates about how to order \u2013 or not to order \u2013 digital \ninternational relations. Yet international theory offers precious little guidance in \nthese debates.\nDoing DIR\nThe kinds of (meta-)theoretical and methodological innovations we have discussed \nearlier will not come easy. They presuppose that we do DIR differently from IR. \nDigital technology can help us upgrade and even augment and rewire. But this does \nnot happen automatically. Once more, agency matters, and this time around it is the \nagency of us as scholars studying digital international relations.\nMore than ever \u2013 and digital technology has a lot to do with this \u2013 can we con -\nceive of our field of study in terms of networks. Yet digital technology does not \nbroaden these networks all by itself or reconfigure the nodes in these networks. \nThe expansion of opportunities to communicate may be seized only within \u2018cita -\ntion cartels\u2019 ( Checkel, 2004 ; Kratochwil, 2003 ) to maintain existing allotments \nor carve out ever smaller ones. Within these cartels, communicative power may \nbe distributed very unequally into those who primarily listen and read on the one \nhand and those doing the speaking and writing on the other. Communication from \nallotment to allotment may be limited to occasional shouting matches that main -\ntain the fences.\nIR has increasingly moved into this direction since the so-called Third Debate. \nThere is no grand debate across different perspectives. Instead, there is a trend \ntowards more and more paradigmatic compartments and communication across \nthem has become increasingly difficult ( Checkel, 2004 ; Grieco, 2019 ; Herrmann, \n1998 ; Kristensen, 2012 ). The Annual International Studies Association\u2019s Confer -\nence, for example, may move towards a digital format as it did in 2021 or incor -\nporate more hybrid formats in the future. This alone, however, is very unlikely to \nreverse the trend. If panels still cater primarily to allotments, discussions continue \nto lack precisely the kinds of liminal spaces that can spark innovation.4 This is a \nkind of communicative configuration that makes upgrading difficult as well as aug -\nmenting and rewiring highly challenging. Research ought to involve heterogeneous \nexchange because this kind of exchange can produce novelty. If the exchange is \nseriously curtailed, we are much more likely to end up with the same old, or some -\nthing very familiar, over and over.\nIf DIR wants to steer clear of stale debates, it has to broaden networks and \nmake communication within these networks more inclusive. To use Granovetter\u2019s \nterminology, DIR ought to strive for many weak ties rather than a few strong ones \n(Granovetter, 1973 ). Such an endeavour would take four lines of criticism seriously \n\n294  Corneliu Bjola and Markus Kornprobst\nthat have been levelled at prevailing IR practices for quite some time: First, rather \nthan focusing on their allotment, scholars would broaden their horizons and look \nat the entire field of study. This would not be equivalent to abandoning holding dif -\nferent perspectives. But it would mean to dare entering debates across perspectives \nand, equally important, being open to be convinced to revise one\u2019s one perspective \nin light of these debates. Note that this is very much how the social (and natu -\nral) sciences describe the way they do science. For as pessimistic a scholar such \nas Bourdieu may have been about communication outside of academia, he fully \nembraced inclusive debates and the free flow of arguments for \u2018homo academicus\u2019 \n(Bourdieu, 1988 ; Swartz, 1997 , pp. 247\u2013269).\nSecond, instead of studying the same players, topics and regions of the world, \nscholarship should embrace what Acharya (2016) calls \u2018global IR\u2019 and what, in \nthe context of this book, one may refer to as \u2018global DIR\u2019. International Relations \nshould not be reduced to, say, the study of great power politics, international secu -\nrity, US foreign policy or the European Union as an actor in international affairs. \nIt ought to be about global politics in all its many different manifestations. This \nmeans, among other things, to re-direct the scholarly gaze towards regions that \nremain notoriously under-researched and ill-understood in the discipline. African \nand Asian regions come to mind immediately.\nThird, as understandable as it may be for a comparatively young discipline to \nbuild up disciplinary walls, studying international affairs requires us to reach out \nto other disciplines. Economics and Sociology have been important sources of \ninspiration in the past. They are likely to remain pertinent to our inter-discipline \nand so are other social sciences and humanities, ranging from Anthropology to \nHistory. Yet given the pace of technological innovation, we increasingly need to \nreach out to the science and technology ( Ancarani, 1995 ; Weiss, 2005 ). Research \non climate change or global health, for example, often needs to cross the divide \nbetween the social sciences and the natural sciences in order to generate meaning -\nful research results.\nFourth, there are not all that many exchanges between scholars, political prac -\ntitioners and the broader public, and when they happen, they often end up being \nrather one-sided. Most notably, some scholars embrace the role of shouting mes -\nsages from the rooftop of the supposed Ivory Tower that are highly contentious \nwithin the discipline but win over practitioners and/or the public because the epis -\ntemic stamp of \u2018truth\u2019 comes with shouting from this mighty rooftop. Note that this \nis very much opposed to how \u2018homo academicus\u2019 describes the way of how he or \nshe generates knowledge. There is plenty of emphasis on uncertainty, scepticism \nand continuously checking truth claims with the help of peers.\nDIR makes it all the more important to take these four criticisms seriously. \nSimply continuing to nurture one\u2019s own allotment makes following any of the \nsignposts sketched above impossible. A  fragmented discipline simply cannot gen -\nerate the inter-perspectival sparks that it takes to upgrade, not even to speak of \n\nConclusion  295\naugmenting and rewiring. Moving beyond what Stanley Hoffmann (1977) once \ncalled \u2018an American discipline\u2019 as well as what Tickner (2013) identified as a West -\nern (mainly US) core and a Southern periphery is all the more important for DIR. \nOtherwise, the digital divide, discussed above already, will simply reinforce these \nunequal relations. Digital disruptions can shake up these relations if scholars come \nup with novel formats and channels to exchange and produce research results in \nmore inclusive fashion. But this certainly does not happen all by itself. DIR simply \ncannot afford just looking at \u2018IR\u2019 without the \u2018D\u2019 and grasping the \u2018D\u2019 has a lot to \ndo with engaging across the social and natural sciences divide. DIR is an inter-\ndiscipline par excellence. Finally, if DIR simply continues IR practices of shout -\ning messages from the rooftop, it will participate in ever more sophisticated spin \ndoctoring. Indeed, the more it makes use of digital technologies to simply spread \nthe message, the more it will distort debates. The shouting will turn into a whisper -\ning that can no longer be easily traced back to the scholarly source. By contrast, \nbroadening the inclusive network of DIR beyond the Ivory Tower of academia and \nmeaningfully engaging political practitioners and the public would make it possi -\nble for DIR to contribute to a global polylogue ( Kornprobst, 2020 ; Wiener, 2017b , \npp. 165\u2013166; Wimmer, 2004 ).\nThere is no escaping from the fact that DIR will shape digital international \naffairs. Scholars, too, are actors (with some having much more agency than others) \nand their doings, too, have repercussions for ordering processes. How scholars will \ndo so, whether \u2018methodologically nationalist\u2019 ( Beck, 2007 ; Wimmer  & Schiller, \n2003 ) or global, whether manipulative and purely geared towards swaying audi -\nences or in the scholarly spirit of an inclusive debate that checks truth claims over \nand over will make a difference for digital international affairs. We\u2019d better keep \nthat in mind.\nNotes\n 1 Whereas Morgenthau (1948 ), Kissinger (1959) and Niebuhr (1959 ) put strong emphasis \non diplomacy (and its role in making balances of power), diplomacy takes a heuristic \nback-seat in other Realist approaches.\n 2 For a review of recent IR studies using computational methods, especially in relation to \nconflict, see \u00dcnver (2019).\n 3 This would mean to move from DIR on to what may be labelled Digital International \nStudies (DIS) or Digital International Affairs (DIA).\n 4 On liminality and innovation, see Tempest and Starkey (2004 ).\nReferences\nAcharya, A.
