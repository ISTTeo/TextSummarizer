The term GC&CS \nremained in widespread use until the end of the Second World \nWar. \nBy contrast, Government Communications Headquarters, or \n'GCHQ', is a term of uncertain origin. Originally developed as \na cover name for Bletchley Park in late 1939, it competed for \nusage with several other designations, including 'BP', 'Station \nX' and indeed 'Gc.&CS'. However, the Government Code and \nCypher School remained the formal title of the whole organis\u00ad\nation in wartime. During 1946, GC&CS re-designated itself the \n'London Signals Intelligence Centre' when the staff of Bletchley \nPark decamped to a new site at Eastcote near Uxbridge, although \nGCHQ remained in widespread use as a cover name. On 1 \nNovember 1948, as Britain's code-breakers began to investigate \na further move away from London to Cheltenham, the term \nGCHQ was formally adopted and has remained in use ever since. \n'Code-breaker' is also a troublesome phrase. Codes are usually \nconsidered to be words substituted for others, often chosen some\u00ad\nwhat at random. Typically, the military operations that consti\u00ad\ntuted D-Day in 1944 were code-named 'Overlord'. By contrast, \nsystems of communication where letters and numbers are substi\u00ad\ntuted in an organised pattern, either by machine or by hand, \nare referred to as cyphers. Yet the term code-breaker is so \nfrequently applied to the people who worked at Bletchley Park \nand at GCHQ that this book follows common usage. \nThe constantly changing names of the Soviet intelligence and \nsecurity services are especially vexing and so, despite the \ninescapable anachronisms, the Soviet civilian intelligence service \nis referred to as 'KGB' until 1989, while the military intelli\u00ad\ngence service is denoted as 'GRU'. In Britain, the Security Service \nis denoted here by the commonly known term 'MIS' and its \nsister organisation, the Secret Intelligence Service or M16, is \nreferred to as 'SIS'\". Ships' and submarines' names are italicised, \ne.g. HMS Turpin. Onshore naval bases and training establish\u00ad\nments, e.g. HMS Anderson, are not italicised. \nA-2 \nASA \nASIO \nBDS \nBfV \nBJ Abbreviations \nUS Air Force Intelligence \nArmy Security Agency [American] \nAustralian Security Intelligence Organisation \nBritish Defence Staff, Washington \nWest German security service \n'Blue jacket' file for signals intelligence or an indi-\nvidual intercept \nBlue Book Weekly digest of co mint material for the PM \nBND Bundesnachrichtendienst -foreign intelligence \nBrixmis \nBRUSA \n'C' \nCESD \nCESG \nCIA \ncomint \ncomsec \nCSE \nCSU \nCX \nDIS service of West Germany \nBritish Military Mission to the HQ Soviet Army in \nEast Germany \nAnglo-American signals intelligence agreement, \n1943 \nChief of the British Secret Intelligence Service \n(SIS) \nCommunications-Electronics Security Department, \nsucceeded by CESG \nCommunications-Electronics Security Group \nCentral Intelligence Agency [American] \nCommunications intelligence \nCommunications security \nCommunications Security Establishment \n[Canadian] \nCivil Service Union \nPrefix for a report originating with SIS \nDefence Intelligence Staff \nDMSI \nDSD \nDWS \nelint \nFBI \nGC&CS \nGCHQ \nGRU \nGTAC \nIRSIG \nJIC \nJSRU \nJSSU \nKGB \nLCSA \nLCSA \nLPG \nMIS \nMI6 \nMiG \nMoD \nMTI \nNATO \nNSA \nNTAC \nPHP Director of Management and Support for \nIntelligence in DIS \nDefence Signals Department [Australian], formerly \nDSB \nDiplomatic Wireless Service \nElectronic intelligence \nFederal Bureau of Investigation [American] \nGovernment Code and Cypher School \nGovernment Communications Headquarters \nSoviet Military Intelligence \nGovernment Technical Assistance Centre, estab\u00ad\nlished in 2000 -later NTAC \nInstructions and Regulations concerning the \nSecurity of Signals Intelligence [Allied] \nJoint Intelligence Committee \nJoint Speech Research Unit \nJoint Services Signals Unit, combined sigint collec\u00ad\ntion units \nRussian secret service \nLondon Communications Security Agency, until \n1963 \nLondon Communications-Electronics Security \nAgency, until 1965 \nLondon Processing Group \nSecurity Service \nSecret Intelligence Service (also SIS) \nMikoyan -Soviet fighter aircraft \nMinistry of Defence \nMethods to Improve, sequential five-year sigint \nprogrammes at GCHQ \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation \nNational Security Agency [American] \nNational Technical Assistance Centre, \npreviously GTAC \nPost-Hostilities Planning Committee \nPSIS \nSAS \nSBS \nSDECE \nSigdasys \nsigint \nSIS \nSOE \nSUSLO \nTICOM \nUKUSA \nVHF \nY Permanent Secretaries' Committee on the \nIntelligence Services \nSpecial Air Service \nSpecial Boat Service \nFrench intelligence service \nAn allied operational sigint distribution system in \nGermany in the 1980s \nSignals intelligence \nSecret Intelligence Service (also MI6) \nSpecial Operations Executive \nSpecial United States Liaison Officer based in \nBritain \nTarget Intelligence Committee dealing with signals \nintelligence \nUK-USA signals intelligence agreements \nVery High Frequency \nWireless interception, usually low-level \nY Section SIS unit undertaking interception activities \nY Service Signals interception arms of the three \nservices \nIntroduction \nGCHQ -The Last Secret? \nGCHQ has been by far the most valuable source of intelligence for \nthe British Government ever since it began operating at Bletchley \nduring the last war. British skills in interception and code-breaking \nare unique and highly valued by our allies. GCHQ has been a \nkey element in our relationship with the United States for more \nthan forty years. \nDenis Healey, House of Commons, 27 February 19841 \n'GCHQ' is the last great British secret. For more than half a \ncentury, Government Communications Headquarters -the \nsuccessor to the famous wartime code-breaking organisation at \nBletchley Park -has been the nation's largest and yet most \nelusive intelligence service. During all of this period it has \ncommanded more staff than the Security Service (MIS) and \nthe Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) combined, and has enjoyed \nthe lion's share of Britain's secret service budget. GCHQ's \nproduct, known as signals intelligence or 'sigini', constituted \nthe majority of the secret information available to political \ndecision-makers during the Cold War. Since then, it has become \nyet more significant in an increasingly 'wired' world. GCHQ \nnow plays a leading role in shaping Britain's secret state, and \nin the summer of 2003 it relocated to a spectacular new head\u00ad\nquarters that constituted the single largest construction project \nin Europe. Today, it is more important than ever -yet we know \nalmost nothing about it.2 \nBy contrast, the wartime work of Bletchley Park is widely \ncelebrated. The importance of decrypted German communica\u00ad\ntions -known as 'the Ultra secret' -to Britain's victory over \nthe Axis is universally recognised. Winston Churchill's wartime \naddiction to his daily supply of 'Ultra' intelligence, derived from \nsupposedly impenetrable German cypher machines such as \n'Enigma', is legendary. The mathematical triumphs of brilliant \n2 INTRODUCTION \nfigures such as Alan Turing are a central part of the story of \nAllied success in the Second World War. The astonishing achieve\u00ad\nment of signals intelligence allowed Allied prime ministers and \npresidents to see into the minds of their Axis enemies. Thanks \nto 'sigint' we too can now read about the futile attempts of \nJapanese leaders to seek a favourable armistice in August 1945, \neven as the last screws were being tightened on the atomic \nbombs destined for Hiroshima and NagasakU \nHowever, shortly after VJ-Day, something ratherodd happens. \nIn the words of Christopher Andrew, the world's leading intel\u00ad\nligence historian, we are confronted with the sudden disap\u00ad\npearance of signals intelligence from the historical landscape. \nThis is an extraordinary omission which, according to Andrew, \nhas 'seriously distorted the study of the Cold War'.4 Intelligence \nservices were at the forefront of the Cold War, yet most accounts \nof international reiations after 1945 stubbornly refuse to recog\u00ad\nnise even the existence of the code-breakers who actually consti\u00ad\ntuted the largest part of this apparatus.5 Nor did this amazing \ncloak of historical invisibility stop with the end of the Cold War. \nIn 2004, following the furore over the role of intelligence in \njustifying the invasion of Iraq, Lord Butler, a former Cabinet \nSecretary, was appointed to undertake an inquiry into 'British \nIntelligence and Weapons of Mass Destruction'. Butler's report \ninto the workings of the secret agencies was unprecedented in \nits depth and detail. However, GCHQ is mentioned only once, \nin the list of abbreviations, where we are told that the acronym \nstands for 'Government Communications Headquarters'.6 This \nis all we learn, for in the subsequent 260 pages the term GCHQ \nis in fact never used, and the organisation is never discussed. \nThe subject is simply too secret. \nSigint was not simply a Second World War phenomenon. \nThroughout the twentieth century, Britain's code-breakers \ncontinually supplied Downing Street with the most precious \njewels of British intelligence, discreetly delivered in what \nbecame known as the 'Blue Book'. Nicholas Henderson, \nGCHQ -THE LAST SECRET? 3 \nformerly Britain's Ambassador to Washington, explains: 'All \nPrime Ministers love intelligence, because it's a sort of weapon \n... The intelligence reports used to arrive in special little boxes, \nand it gave them a belief that they had a direct line to some\u00ad\nthing that no other ordinary departments have: It was partly \nfor this reason that British Prime Ministers 'never minded \nspending money on intelligence'. Signals intelligence also \nmatters to political leaders because it allows them to hear the \nauthentic voices of their enemies. Although Winston Churchill \nwas the most famous recipient of such material, his prede\u00ad\ncessor, Neville Chamberlain, was also offered some remarkable \ninsights into the mind of Adolf Hitler. In 1939, shortly after \nthe Munich appeasement, Chamberlain was given an intelli\u00ad\ngence report which showed that Hitler habitually referred to \nhim in private as 'der alter Arschloch', or 'the old arsehole'. \nUnderstandably, this revelation 'had a profound effect on \nChamberlain'.7 \nHowever, constant exposure to secrets derived from the world \nof code-breaking, bugging and other kinds of secret listening \nhas the capacity to induce paranoia. Harold Wilson regularly \ndragged his Private Secretary, Bernard Donoughue, into the \nbathrooms and toilets of Downing Street. Only there, with the \ntaps turned on full and water sloshing noisily in the basins, did \nhe feel immune to the threat of bugs.8 A top priority for Britain's \ntechnical security specialists during the Wilson years was the \ninstallation of the latest scrambler phones at the Prime Minister's \nholiday home in the Scilly Isles, so he could speak to Whitehall \nwithout fear of interception. Doubtless, Wilson would have been \ndelighted to learn that some of his opponents felt equally \noppressed by electronic surveillance. When Ian Smith, the \nRhodesian leader, visited London in late 1965 he insisted on \nhaving some of the more sensitive conversations with his dele\u00ad\ngation in the ladies' lavatory, convinced that this was the one \nlocation where British intelligence would not have dared to \nplant microphones.9 \nSecret listening terrified friend and foe alike. Harold Macmillan \n4 INTRODUCTION \nrecalled the almost unbearable sense of oppression he felt on \nhis visit to Moscow to see the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, \nin 1959. His delegation feared that British codes were comprom\u00ad\nised, and they were unable to talk freely, even outside in the \nopen air, because of constant technical surveillance. He would \nhave been fascinated to learn that, at the very same moment, \nKhrushchev and his immediate circle also felt increasingly \nanxious about KGB microphones, to the extent that they dared \nnot speak freely, even amongst themselves in their own capital.JO \nIn June 1966, to his immense fury, President Tito of Yugoslavia \ndiscovered that he was being bugged by his own security chief. \n'Concealed microphone$ have been installed everywhere,' he \nexclaimed angrily to a friend: 'Even my bedroom!'JJ \nThe supreme example of the way in which eavesdropping \ncould have political consequences was the Watergate scandaL \nwhich gradually brought about the downfall of President Richard \nNixon between April 1973 and July 1974. Nixon had used a \nteam of former CIA operatives known as 'The Plumbers' to \nburgle and bug premises used by the Democratic Party. Not \neveryone was shocked. In 1973, Britain's Prime Minister, Edward \nHeath, made a visit to China. Mao Tse-tung asked him, 'What \nis all this Nixon nonsense about?' Heath asked what he meant \nby 'nonsense'. Mao replied: 'Well, they say he bugged his oppon\u00ad\nents, don't they? But we all bug our opponents, don't we, and \neverybody knows it? So what is all this fuss about?'J2 Others \ntook bugging in their stride. When Tony Blair visited India in \nOctober 200 t his security team found two bugs in his bedroom, \nand reported that 'they wouldn't be able to remove them without \ndrilling the wall'. Blair 'decided against making a fuss', and \nquietly moved to another room. 13 \nEavesdropping and code-breaking are certainly nothing new. \nEven in medieval times the crowned heads of Europe had \nrecourse to secretive 'black chambers' where encyphered letters \nfrom diplomats were intercepted, opened and decoded in order \nto produce intelligence. However, the modern-day GCHQ owes \nits origins to the arrival of the radio and the enormous impact \nGCHQ -THE LAST SECRET? 5 \nof science upon methods of fighting during the Second World \nWar. It was the struggle against Hitler that revolutionised the \nimportance of intelligence from encyphered radio messages. \nBlitzkrieg and surprise attack were the hallmarks of a new style \nof warfare that arrived in the late 1930s. The sheer speed of \nwar now meant that secrets smuggled under the coat collar of \na traditional human spy were no longer of much use to \ncommanders. The code-breakers of Bletchley Park were the \nperfect answer, offering intelligence in 'real time' from inter\u00ad\ncepted enemy signals. In some cases, messages sent from Hitler \nto Rommel in the Western Desert were decoded and arrived on \nChurchill's desk before they were read by their intended recip\u00ad\nient. Soon, Bletchley Park presided over machine-based espi\u00ad\nonage on an industrial scale. \nWith the onset of the Cold War, 'sigint', as it had become \nknown, seemed equally important for a dangerous new era of \nnuclear confrontation. Atomic weapons and equivalent break\u00ad\nthroughs in biological and chemical warfare, together with \nballistic rockets such as the V2, against which there was no \ndefence, were the new currency of conflict. World leaders were \nrequired to comprehend strange new threats and the accom\u00ad\npanying possibility of devastating surprise attack -which Lord \nTedder, the British Chief of the Air Staff, called a potential \n'nuclear Pearl Harbor'. The precarious world of early warning, \ndeterrence and 'targeting' had arrived. Military chiefs demanded \nbetter intelligence, and concluded that global sigint coverage \nwas indispensable to the Western allies. By the mid-1950s, \nBritain's code-breakers had abandoned their nissen huts at \nBletchley Park for new accommodation in Cheltenham, the \ndistinctive radomes and satellite dishes of which became an inte\u00ad\ngral part of the Cold War landscape.14 \nIronically, the story of GCHQ after it entered 'peacetime' in \n1945 is very much about military operations, and even war. \nBritain's vast sigint programme was managed by GCHQ, but run \nin cooperation with the armed services, which used their bases, \nships and aircraft to collect the raw enemy signals. As this book \n6 INTRODUCTION \nreveals, GCHQ sat at the centre of a spider's web that consisted \nof many other hidden organisations, both dvil and military, which \nhelped it collect signals intelligence. Many of its stories intertwine \nclosely with Britain's long legacy of small wars and guerrilla \nconflicts in locations such as Korea, Malaya, Borneo, Aden and \nthe Falklands. GCHQ's operations also involved hair-raising \nconfrontations with the Russians. Britain ran secret submarine \nspy missions designed to gather signals intelligence from the \nRussian fleet. Spedally converted submarines entered the protected \nharbours of the Russian Navy and rose precariously beneath \ncruisers to within six feet of their electronic quarry. Submarines \nthat were sent on sigint missions -known to their anxious crews \nas 'Dodgies' or 'Mystery Trips' -were detected off Murmansk and \npursued by Russian destroyers with depth charges. GCHQ's ocean\u00ad\ngoing activities have been a well-kept secret, but some British \nsubmariners still bear the scars of this secret signals war in the \nfar north. \nCode-breaking is sometimes depicted as highly technical -more \n'Billion Dollar Brain' than James Bond -and therefore perhaps \na little dull. But much of the GCHQ story involves dramatic \nincidents experienced by individual sigint operators in forward \nlocations, including in submarines and aircraft. However it was \ndone, gathering sigint almost always involved a three-stage \nprocess. First, someone had to listen in to and record the inter\u00ad\ncepted message. Throughout the Cold War this person was often \nthe Godforsaken GCHQ 'operator' who sat for eight hours at a \ntime in front of a rack radio made by Racal. With headphones \non and the volume turned up to 'max' he or she endured the \nfreezing cold of the German winter and the unbearable heat of \nthe Iraqi summer. Once the message was captured it was passed \nback to Cheltenham for processing. If it was in code, it might \nbe given to X Division, a section staffed by 'boffins' with vast \ncomputers whose power far outstripped that available to ordin\u00ad\nary scientists. Finally, intelligence analysts would try to compose \nthe resulting material into useful summaries. Stamped with an \nGCHQ -THE LAST SECRET? 7 \nexcruciatingly high security classification, it was then circulated \nto Cabinet Ministers, defence chiefs and senior policy-makers. \nOften, only a few hours after they had been read by the 'high\u00ad\nups', the summaries were whisked away in 'burn-bags' and \nconsigned to vast incinerators to protect their secrecy. \nGCHQ is also synonymous with the mysterious international \nnetwork known as 'Echelon', run by British and American \nintelligence. Echelon is the world's largest information 'vacuum \ncleaner', drawing in huge amounts of communications -an \nestimated five billion intercepts every day. Yet much of what \nwe have come to helieve about this network is wrongY The \nAnglo-American sigint relationship is often portrayed as a cosy \naffair of affable, pipe-smoking professor types. In fact, the poli\u00ad\ntics of intelligence was often opportunistic and harsh. Secretly, \nthe British and Americans worked together to read the traffic \nof their own minor allies, including France and West Germany. \nEven at the top, relations between the two main partners, \nBritain and the United States, could turn nasty and involved \nsharp disagreements. \nWhat bound Britain and America together in the world of \nsignals intelligence was realism, not romanticism. Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican intelligence cooperation was about trading 'terrain for \ntechnology'. America had its own vast code-breaking organisa\u00ad\ntion, the National Security Agency (NSA), with infinitely more \nresources than the British. However, the American code-breakers \nneeded remote outposts in Britain's 'residual empire' at which \nto base their listening stations, and they rewarded GCHQ hand\u00ad\nsomely with access to remarkable technology. Some locations, \nsuch as Cyprus, were so important to the collection of sigint that \nUKUSA actually helped to shape the international politics of the \nregion. In 1974, faced with a financial crisis, the British govern\u00ad\nment formally decided to withdraw from its bases in Cyprus in \norder to save money. Within days, Washington told London that \nthis decision was not acceptable and they must stay. The reason \nwas simple. The sigint bases that allowed America to listen in \nto the Middle East were quite indispensable. In 2009, more than \n8 INTRODUCTION \nthirty years after the British government's decision to withdraw \nfrom Cyprus, the sigint bases are still there, and have grown \nconsiderably in size. \nCold War espionage activity enjoyed a high profile. British defec\u00ad\ntors such as Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean hit the head\u00ad\nlines in the 1950s. The 1960s opened with the shooting down \nof the American U-2 spy plane piloted by Gary Powers, the \nCIA's fiasco at the Bay of Pigs and the Profumo affair. Yet GCHQ \nmanaged to avoid the glare of unwelcome publicity until the \nlast decade of the Cold War. Its journey from the shadows into \nthe spotlight only began in 1976, when the radical journalist \nDuncan Campbell revealed its intelligence operations on Cyprus \nin an article in Time Out magazine. This led to the infamous \n'ABC trial', at which Campbell and his associates were pros\u00ad\necuted under the Official Secrets Act. Thereafter, GCHQ's hopes \nto return to obscurity were dashed by the Geoffrey Prime affair \nin 1982. Prime, who revealed the innermost working of \nAmerica's latest multi-billion-dollar sigint satellite programme \nto the Soviets, was one of the most damaging moles ever \nrecruited from inside British intelligence. Just as the Prime case \nsubsided, any hopes of a return to anonymity were obliterated \nby Margaret Thatcher'S controversial decision to ban trade unions \nat GCHQ. \nExpensive technical agencies such as GCHQ and America's \nNSA were obvious targets for cuts at the end of the Cold War. \nAt the same time, both agencies were struggling to cope with \nthe pace of the global information-technology revolution, that \nhad made access to high-grade encryption easy for the private \nindividual. All this, together with the exponential growth in \ninternet traffic, threatened to make the work of GCHQ and NSA \nimpossibly difficult. Soon the world was sending several million \nemails a second, and not even the great sigint leviathans could \nread them all. The days of the super-secret sigint agencies seemed \nnumbered. However, in the 1990s Britain's prominent role in \nthe wars in Bosnia and then Kosovo reminded government that \nGCHQ -THE LAST SECRET? 9 \nthe need for sigint is perennial. In these Byzantine conflicts, the \nradio experts at Cheltenham were never quite sure which of \nthe many different former Yugoslavian factions their various \nfriends and allies were supporting. \nBitter conflicts such as Bosnia helped to convince Whitehall \nand Westminster that GCHQ was worth new investment. In \n1996, under the direction of Sir David Omand, GCHQ began to \ndevelop plans for a remarkable new intelligence headquarters \nthat quickly became known as 'the Doughnut' owing to its \ncircular design. The intention was to bring all the staff together \nunder one roof for the first time. Absorbing no less than fifteen \nmiles of carpet and several hundred miles of fibre-optic cabling, \n'the Doughnut' constituted the largest secret intelligence head\u00ad\nquarters outside the United States. However, by the time it was \ncompleted in 2003, it was already too small. GCHQ had by then \nundergone a crash expansion following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. \nIts employees, now numbering more than 5,200, were soon \n'hot-desking'. A shanty town of subsidiary buildings is already \nspringing up around the new headquarters. \nToday, in somewhat cramped circumstances, GCHQ struggles \nwith some of the most difficult issues of the twenty-first century. \nNot only is it the leading edge of Britain's struggle against al \nQaeda, it is also involved in fundamental issues of freedom and \nprivacy that will shape the future of our society. Over the last \ndecade, Britain has engaged with global e-commerce and finance \nmore enthusiastically than perhaps any other country in the \nworld. Our porous electronic borders present their own enor\u00ad\nmous problems. Globalisation, and in particular the global \ncommunications revolution, has brought many benefits, but it \nhas also allowed miscreants to communicate and organise anony\u00ad\nmously. The need for GCHQ to monitor both terrorists and \norganised crime means that the distinction between domestic \nand foreign communications has less meaning than it once had. \nGCHQ used to be a wholly outward-looking foreign intelligence \nservice, but this is no longer the case. \nWho will rule the internet? Will ordinary citizens be allowed \n10 INTRODUCTION \ngenuinely confidential communication? Would ID cards erode \nour privacy or extend our security? These are some of the ques\u00ad\ntions that GCHQ ponders daily at the beginning of the second \ndecade of the twenty-first century. Britain is already one of the \nmost watched societies in the world, and some would argue \nthat it is now addicted to surveillance. In 2008, Britain \nannounced a \u00a312 billion project to modernise the interception \nof telephone calls and email. The following year GCHQ \nannounced a remarkable project entitled 'Mastering the Internet' \nthat collects the details of Britain's communications and internet \ntraffic for security purposes. Even Britain's Director of Public \nProsecutions thought things had gone too far. Tasked with taking \nthe lead on technological aspects of intelligence, GCHQ now \nfinds itself at the centre of controversies that are of immense \npublic importance. Accordingly, the time is ripe to trace GCHQ's \nlong and secretive journey from the nissen huts of Bletchley \nPark -via the Cold War -towards what now looks increasingly \nlike a Brave New World. \nTHE 1940s \nBLETCHLEY PARI( \nAND BEYOND \n1 \nSchooldays \n'How wonderful!' I said. 'Do you mean we're overhearing \nPortsmouth ships trying to talk to each other -that we're eaves\u00ad\ndropping across half South England?' \n'Just that.' \nRudyard Kipling, 'Wireless', 19041 \nIn December 1902, Guglielmo Marconi made history by sending \nthe first wireless radio message across the Atlantic. Remarkably, \nonly two years later, Rudyard Kipling foretold the possibility of \nexploiting such radio messages to gather intelligence. In 1904 \nhe published a short story entitled 'Wireless' that focused on \nintercepting communications sent from Morse equipment on \nboard Royal Navy ~hips off the Isle of Wight. Kipling is thought \nof as a quintessentially late-Victorian author, but here he looks \nto the future, more in the manner of H.G. Wells, as his char\u00ad\nacters fret over technical matters such as induction and radio \nfrequencies. To the readers of this fictional first instance of radio \ninterception, the process seemed utterly magical. The Morse \ninstrument 'ticked furiously', and one of the listening party \nobserves that it reminds him of a seance, with 'odds and ends \nof messages coming out of nowhere'. His companion retorts \nthat spiritualists and mediums 'are all impostors', whereas these \nnaval messages that they are eavesdropping on are the real \nthing.2 \nKipling's 'Wireless' is the first public discussion of the secret \nbusiness of signals intelligence, or 'sigint'. The magical process \nof extracting information from the ether would be one of the \ntwentieth century's most closely guarded secrets. Initially, \nproducing 'sigint' only required equipment that would allow a \n14 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nthird party to eavesdrop on a conversation broadcast by a radio \ntransmitter using 'wireless telegraphy', but as this possibility \nbecame more widely known, communicators often resorted to \nusing cyphers to keeIJ their messages private. Thereafter, \nproducing sigint usually required skilled listeners to capture the \nmessage and then a team of code-breakers to unscramble it. If \nthe message was sent by cable rather than wireless, the listening\u00ad\nin process could be no less difficult than the code-breaking, or \n'decyphering' . \nWhat did Britain's code-breakers make of Kipling's public \nairing of their black arts? The simple answer is that there were \nnone to ask. Indeed, there had been no British code-breakers \nfor more than fifty years. In the distant past, Britain had \npossessed a 'black chamber' in which skilled 'cryptanalysts' had \nbroken the codes contained in diplomatic correspondence and \nprivate letters. These arcane skills resided in the 'Secret \nDepartment' of the Post Office. However, in 1847 this was \nexposed in a scandalous episode when the House of Commons \nheard that the Home Secretary had ordered the interception of \nthe private correspondence of the heroic Italian nationalist in \nexile, Giuseppe Mazzini. Shocked Members of Parliament \nordered an inquiry, leading to the closure of the 'Secret \nDepartment', just as the telegraph initiated what we now under\u00ad\nstand as a Victorian communications revolution. By 1904, Britain \nhad been without a code-breaking centre for more than half a \ncentury.3 \nThe immediate origins of MI5 and its sister service SIS (often \nknown as MI6) can be traced to scares about German espionage \nin 1909. But British code-breaking was not revived until the \nvery eve of the First World War. On 2 August 1914 the British \nArmy set up a secret code-breaking section called MIl b. Soon, \nspecialist Army units at various locations in Europe and the \nMiddle East were busy intercepting German radio communica\u00ad\ntions. One of the largest sites was the intercept station in \nMesopotamia. In December 1916 the military code-breakers of \nMIl b were given a fabulous Christmas present when the \nSCHOOLDAYS 15 \ndrunken chief of the German signals organisation in the Middle \nEast sent all his Radio Operators a seasonal greeting using the \nsame obvious formula in no fewer than six different codes. Up \nuntil that point the British had only been able to read one of \nthese codes, but with these clues they could read all six. In the \nFirst World War, the Second World War and again in the Cold \nWar, poor discipline by the human operators often proved to \nbe the great weakness in otherwise impregnable cypher systems.4 \nThe Royal Navy code-breakers, who had established them\u00ad\nselves in the Admiralty'S 'Room 40', achieved even greater \nsuccess. Famously, they broke the 'Zimmermann Telegram', a \nmessage sent from the German Foreign Minister, Arthur \nZimmermann, suggesting an alliance between Germany and \nMexico against the United States. As an inducement, Mexico \nwas to be offered the return of her lost territories in Texas, New \nMexico and Arizona. These revelations, made public in March \n1917, were central in bringing the United States into the First \nWorld War on the side of Britain and France. The American \nentry into the war, together with a tightening blockade, \npersuaded Germany to seek an armistice the following year. \nThe code-breakers of Room 40 celebrated with champagne. \nThere are few more significant examples of the direct impact \nof code-breaking upon international relations.5 \nIn 1919 the British government's Secret Service Committee, \nchaired by Lord Curzon, the rather formidable Foreign Secretary, \nrecommended that a unified peacetime code-breaking agency \nshould be created. This involved the difficult merger of two \nquite separate organisations. The head of the Army code\u00ad\nbreakers, Major Malcolm Hay, was awkward and argumenta\u00ad\ntive, while his naval equivalent, Commander Alastair Denniston, \nproved to be suave and diplomatic. Denniston secured the job \nas chief of a new combined code-breaking organisation, which \ninitially consisted of around two dozen intelligence officers and \na similar number of clerical staff, and found himself installed \nin splendid accommodation at Watergate House in The Strand, \nnext to the Savoy Hotel. Formed on 1 November 1919, the new \n16 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \norganisation was given the name 'Government Code and Cypher \nSchool', or GC&CS, which was not inappropriate, since the \nleading code-breakers devoted a great deal of time to the patient \ntraining of new initiates.6 Both during the First World War and \nin the interwar period about half the staff of GC&CS and its \npredecessors were women, mostly in the clerical grades. \nAlmost immediately, GC&CS adopted a disingenuous descrip\u00ad\ntion of its duties that would remain in place until the 1980s. \nPublicly, its functions were described as merely defensive; in \nother words, it was to assist in the provision and protection of \ncodes and cyphers used by government departments. However, \nits more secret duty was to give priority to offensive activity, \nnamely attacking the cypher communications used by foreign \npowers. GC&CS gradually shifted its focus to diplomatic traffic, \nand at the suggestion of Lord Curzon it was transferred to the \ncontrol of the Foreign Office. It seemed natural that within the \nForeign Office structure it should be placed under the supervi\u00ad\nsion of Britain's traditional overseas intelligence service, SIS, \nwhich recruited human spies. But a subliminal naval influence \nremained. The !alented Chief of SIS, Mansfield Cumming \n(known within the organisation as 'e', the name by which the \nhead of SIS would continue to be called), was a former naval \nofficer. Cumming died in harness in 1923 and was succeeded \nby another sailor, the former head of Naval Intelligence, Hugh \n'Quex' Sinclair. Naval intelligence and naval signals officers \ncontinued to exercise a profound influence on GC&CS and its \nsuccessors as late as the 1970s. \nThe means by which Britain collected its intelligence was \nchanging. During the First World War, much of its intelligence \nwork had involved overhearing military wireless messages by \nmeans of receiving stations scattered around Europe, the \nMediterranean and the Middle East. The shift to diplomatic \ntraffic meant undertaking more work on encyphered diplomatic \ntelegrams sent by cable. Each country had teams of code clerks \nwho carefully encyphered diplomatic messages before they were \nsent by telegram using a worldwide network of cables. Although \nSCHOOLDAYS 17 \ngovernment cable censorship had officially ended in 1918, a \nprivate arrangement meant that all the commercial cable compa\u00ad\nnies secretly handed over their traffic to GC&CS for copying. \nMost of the foreign ('mbassies in London used cable companies \nto send their encyphered messages, and British dominance of \ninternational telecommunications networks meant that many \nof the world's messages travelled over British cables at some \npoint. Private companies such as Standard Cable & Wireless Ltd \nwere almost an integral part of the worldwide British sigint \nsystem. This secret state-private network remained hidden until \nit was exposed by the journalist Chapman Pincher in February \n1967 in the Daily Mail under the headline 'Cable Vetting \nSensation'.7 \nIn 1925 both SIS and GC&CS were moved into Sinclair's new \nsecret service headquarters at Broadway Buildings, opposite St \nJames's Park tube station, which its occupants thought 'more \ndingy than sinister'. The walls of the corridors were painted \ndark brown to a height of about four feet from the floor, and \nthe ancient lifts moved between the many storeys with a slow \nclatter. The code-breakers were given the third floor. From here, \nthe sigint product, which consisted of the verbatim text (or \nsometimes summaries) of the messages of foreign governments \nwas distributed around Whitehall in files with special blue jackets \nthat became known as 'BJs'. GC&CS worked on the cyphers of \nmany countries in the interwar period, including those of France, \nthe United States and Japan, since they all shed light on inter\u00ad\nnational affairs; but the most important were those of Russia.8 \nBoth MI5 and SIS, together with intelligence officers from \nthe three armed services, were obsessed with the threat from \nBolshevik Russia in the interwar period. GC&CS followed suit. \nThere were good reasons for making Moscow the pre-eminent \ntarget. Bolshevik agents were actively seeking to subvert the \nBritish Empire, and sigint produced operational intelligence that \ncould be used to thwart these plots. Alastair Denniston enjoyed \na major advantage, having recruited Ernst Fetterlein, the Tsar's \nleading code-breaker, when he fled Russia after the Revolution \n18 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nof 1917, and in the 1920s GC&CS was successfully reading \nSoviet diplomatic cyphers. Several times during that decade the \nBritish government directly accused the Soviets of underhand \nactivities in London, making use of these intercepts and refer\u00ad\nring to them openly. In 1923, for example, Lord Curzon publicly \nquoted Soviet messages intercepted by GC&CS stations in India. \nThe Soviets responded by changing their cyphers, but Fetterlein \nsimply broke them again.9 \nHowever, in May 1927, a year after the General Strike, a \ndisastrous row erupted over secret support from Moscow for \nthe strikers and the distribution of subversive propaganda in \nBritain. A veritable centre for Soviet subversion was being run \nunder the cover of its Trade Mission, located in the Arcos building \nin Moorgate. The building was raided on 12 May, but advance \nwarning allowed the Soviets to destroy most of the incrimi\u00ad\nnating material. The Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, was \nembarrassed. He ardently desired to break off relations with \nMoscow, but having failed to garner any incriminating evidence \nfrom the Arcos raid, he turned to the priceless intercepts provided \nby GC&CS. To the dismay of the code-breakers, Baldwin and \nhis Foreign Secretary, Neville Chamberlain, read out four \ndecyphered Soviet telegrams in Parliament in order to make \ntheir case. Alastair Denniston was especially bitter about this \nflagrant compromise of GC&CS secrets.lO \nHenceforth, the Soviets changed their cyphers and deployed \nmore secure systems for communications with diplomatic and \ncommercial missions overseas, including their intelligence \nstations. They now used the 'one-time pad' for their more impor\u00ad\ntant communications. The one-time pad was a breakthrough \nsystem created by an American army officer, Major Joseph \nMauborgne, during the First World War and widely adopted by \nother powers. It involved using a sheet of random numbers to \nencypher a message. Each letter in the message was given a \nnumber. Each number was then added to another from a stream \nof random numbers taken from a sheet on the one-time pad. \nThe result was a sheet of text that consisted simply of groups \nSCHOOLDAYS 19 \nof five numbers, one after another. Recipients could decode the \nmessage if they possessed the same sheet from the same one\u00ad\ntime pad. If that sheet was used only once -hence the name \n-and for a single message, the lack of repetition prevented \ndecryption. In short, the code was unbreakable. The disadvan\u00ad\ntage was that it was slow and cumbersome, and therefore it \nwas reserved for high-grade secrets. Moreover, vast numbers of \npads with lists of random numbers were required. No country, \nnot even the security-obsessed Soviet Union, could send all its \ncommunications by this means. II \nNevertheless, after 1927, few Soviet diplomatic messages were \nbeing read by GC&CS. The only high-grade Soviet traffic that \nwas decyphered were the messages of the Comintern, the part \nof the Soviet Communist Party that dealt with relations with \nCommunist parties overseas. This effort was led by John Tiltman, \na brilliant major from the Indian Army who had been running \na small but successful interception effort in north India during \nthe 1920s. In 1929 he was brought back to London to lead an \nexpanded operation against Comintern communications (which \nwere code-named 'Mask'). This allowed the British government \nto learn of the secret subsidies paid by Moscow to the Communist \nParty of Great Britain and its newspaper, the Daily Worker. It \nalso contributed to important successes against major Comintern \nagents in imperial outposts and international centres such as \nSingapore and ShanghaL12 \nFaced with the real threat of active subversion throughout \nthe British Empire by the Comintern, GC&CS paid limited atten\u00ad\ntion to military matters or the rise of the Axis until the mid-\n1930s. Germany, Italy and Japan were a remarkably low priority. \nAdmittedly, a small naval section of GC&CS had been set up in \n1925, and its most important work was done overseas by naval \nofficers like Eric Nave, based in Hong Kong. From here they \nhad ample practice at following military operations, because of \nthe extensive fighting in Manchuria during the 1930s. Italy's \nattack on Abyssinia in 1936 provided a new target for British \ncode-breakers in the Middle East, located at sites such as \n20 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nHabbaniya in Iraq and Sarafand in Palestine. Remarkably, and \ndespite the growing importance of air power, GC&CS only devel\u00ad\noped an RAF section in 1936, under Josh Cooper, a young and \ntalented code-breaker who had joined the organisation a decade \nearlier with a First in Russian from King's College London. 13 \nCyphers were important to the Axis military powers. One\u00ad\ntime pads were slow and cumbersome. Moreover, they were \nout of step with the emerging new methods of warfare. \nBlitzkrieg, for example, required armoured forces to move \nforward at lightning speed, coordinating their activities with \nartillery and air support. So the pressure was on to find a way \nof making the growing volume of military radio traffic unin\u00ad\ntelligible to the enemy. Most developed countries turned to \ncypher machines to make their immense volumes of traffic \nsecure.14 Complex cypher machines had been pioneered by \nbanks and businesses -banks had long used fairly simple cyphers \nto keep commercial matters secret. In the 1920s, the German \nmilitary adapted a Dutch invention to produce the Enigma \ncypher machine as an alternative to laborious hand cyphers. In \nfact, the first Enigma machines were sold commercially, and \nwere widely used by banks and businesses. Enigma was what \nwe now recognise as a 'commercial off-the-shelf solution' to a \ndifficult military problem.15 \nThe Enigma machine itself looked like an early typewriter in \na square wooden box, but with a keyboard set out in alpha\u00ad\nbetical order rather than the traditional 'QWERTY' arrangement. \nAs each letter key was depressed a set of lights that corresponded \nto the alphabet lit up, seemingly at random. The innovation \nwas the rotors, which looked like fat metal wheels, embedded \nin the top of the machine. These rotated and scrambled the \nmessage in a highly unpredictable way. There were initially \nthree -later four -rotors, with twenty-six positions relating to \nthe letters of the alphabet. These moved round in a stepping \nmotion that generated a cypher with an enormous number of \npossibilities. Moreover the complex nature of the rotation caused \nsubtle changes in the stream of material, creating substantial \nSCHOOLDAYS 21 \nheadaches for any would-be code-breaker. The Germans were \nnot alone in developing cypher machines. The British and \nAmericans developed similar devices, respectively called the \nTypex and Sigaba.16 \nCritical to the breaking of Enigma was assistance from the \nsecret services of France and Poland. French intelligence \nemployed a lugubrious German agent called Hans Schmidt, who \nworked in the German military cypher department. Fond of the \nfiner things in life, which the French secret service supplied \nto him in abundance, Schmidt divulged many technical docu\u00ad\nments about Enigma, including messages in both clear and \nencyphered text. He was later betrayed, and would commit \nsuicide using cyanide procured for him by his daughter. By 1938 \nthese secrets were being shared with the British through 'Biffy' \nDunderdale, the SIS station chief in Paris. However, when the \nFrench gave the British material on German Air Force commu\u00ad\nnications a further secret was accidentally revealed, namely that \nthe French were also working on Enigma in collaboration with \nthe Poles. In January 1939 Alastair Denniston took two of his \ntop code-breakers, Hugh Foss and Dilly Knox, to Paris to meet \ntheir French and Polish opposite numbers. Eventually they \ndiscovered that the Poles had completely reconstructed the \nGerman version of the Enigma machineY \nRemarkably, by 1938 the Polish code-breakers were able to \nread the majority of German Army Enigma messages. The Polish \nbreakthrough had been to train professional mathematicians to \nhelp them, together with the use of a primitive processor called \nthe 'bomba' or 'bombe' -so named because of the alarming \nticking noise it made -to find the rotor settings. One of their \nfirst 'bombes' was a weird contraption that consisted of no fewer \nthan six Enigma-type machines wired together to provide rapid \nprocessing of possible solutions. Polish resources were limited, \nand by late 1938 new advances in the Enigma machine were \nrunning ahead of the ability of the Poles to do their calcula\u00ad\ntions. But the precious secrets that the Poles taught the British \nwere enough to continue the unravelling of Enigma. The timing \n22 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nwas an extraordinary stroke of luck, since the talented Polish \ncypher bureau was within two months of being broken up by \nthe coordinated German-Soviet invasion of Poland in the \nautumn of 1939. Before the Polish secret service was forced to \nflee Warsaw, its agents had achieved the remarkable feat of \nstealing several examples of the military Enigma machine from \nthe German factory where they were made. \nIn the late 1930s, Britain lived in the shadow of the aerial \nbomber. Following the tragic fate of the Spanish town of \nGuernica in the spring of 1937, the presumption was that the \nfirst few days of the approaching war with Germany would \nbring untold destruction from the air, levelling the cities of \nEurope. By the Munich Crisis of 1938, Whitehall had begun to \nmake emergency preparations. Admiral Hugh Sinclair, the Chief \nof SIS, was busy looking for alternative wartime accommoda\u00ad\ntion away from London for both SIS and GC&CS. He soon settled \non a country house, Bletchley Park, near Milton Keynes in \nBuckinghamshire, as an ideal location for the code-breakers. \nMuch has been made of Bletchley Park's proximity to Oxford \nand Cambridge, but in fact the availability of good trunk cable \ncommunications was the dominant consideration. Bureaucratic \nbickering now erupted. Although GC&CS was run by the Foreign \nOffice, its relocation was considered to be war contingency plan\u00ad\nning, so the diplomats insisted that the military pay the bill. \nPredictably, the War Office insisted that GC&CS was nothing to \ndo with it, and emergency relocation for Britain's most valu\u00ad\nable wartime asset stalled. In the end, Hugh Sinclair bought \nBletchley Park with his own money, paying over \u00a37,500 (more \nthan \u00a3330,000 at today's prices). This remarkable act of \ngenerosity allowed the first wave of evacuated staff to arrive at \nBletchley on 15 August 1939. Sinclair's largesse did not stop \nthere. He acquired a top chef from London to provide food to \nthe code-breakers in a restaurant in the main hall, complete \nwith full waitress service. IS \nThe emphasis at Bletchley Park was distinctly military. The \nSCHOOLDAYS 23 \nmain body of GC&CS was initially broken up into NavaL Military \nand Air Sections and allocated to the ground floor of the main \nhouse, while SIS was given the top floor, indicating that it still \nruled the roost. On the periphery, an ever-growing collection \nof numbered wooden huts -including the famous Hut Three \nand Hut Six -were being constructed. Particular activities were \nassociated with each hut: typically, the core of the Enigma \nproblem was worked on in Hut Six, while its exploitation for \nintelligence purposes was undertaken in Hut Three. One former \ncode-breaker recalls that the main house was soon 'too small \nfor more than a handful of top brass and their immediate \nacolytes'. So Bletchley Park's considerable garden, with its \nrosebeds and delightful maze, gradually disappeared beneath \nthe expanding penumbra of temporary structures.19 The shadow \nof the bomber even reached out to Bletchley Park. The radio \ntransmission infrastructure involved elaborate aerials which had \nthe potential to give away the site's location from the air. \nAccordingly, Bletchley Park's own radio station was moved to \nnearby Whaddon Hall. As the operation gained momentum, \nother nearby premises were absorbed. EImers School, a neigh\u00ad\nbouring boys' boarding establishment, was requisitioned for the \nGC&CS Diplomatic Sections. \nBletchley Park was Admiral Sir Hugh Sinclair's last bequest \nto Britain's sigint community. Through the early autumn of \n1939 it was clear that he was terminally ill with cancer. His \ndeputy and heir apparent, Stewart Menzies, was not regarded \nas a great brain, and indeed despised intellectuals. Sir Alexander \nCadogan, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, \nvigorously resisted the idea that Menzies might succeed Sinclair, \nand argued for someone from outside SIS to shake the organ\u00ad\nisation up. Senior SIS officers, however, did not want 'a new \nbroom at this critical stage'. 20 Cadogan noted in his diary, 'I am \nnot satisfied that Menzies is the man,' but Menzies did have a \ncrude talent for furthering his own ambitions, which he soon \ndemonstrated. On Sunday, 5 November he came to see Cadogan \nbearing the sad news of the death of Sinclair the previous day. \n24 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nCadogan noted that he 'gave me a sealed letter from \"C\" recom\u00ad\nmending him (M[enzies]) as successor'.2l Lord Halifax, the \nForeign Secretary, pressed for Menzies, who was finally accepted \nas the new Chief on 28 November.22 \nThe arrival of Menzies was a problem for Bletchley Park \nbecause the code-breakers were still subordinate to SIS. Under \nMenzies the administration of SIS was 'chaotic', and its head\u00ad\nquarters was in 'a state of upheaval' throughout 1940.23 Cadogan \nmaintained his view that Menzies was a mentally disorganised \nintriguer who devoted more time to protecting the interests of \nSIS than to serious intelligence-collection. Typically, in March \n1941, after Cadogan had met Menzies and the Directors of \nIntelligence of the three armed services, he recorded in his diary: \n'''C'' as usual, a bad advocate on his own behalf. He babbles \nand wanders, and gives the impression he is putting up a smoke\u00ad\nscreen of words and trying to put his questioners off the track:24 \nCadogan longed to see a thorough overhaul of SIS, which he \nregarded as an organisational basket-case. However, as the war \ndragged on, he had less and less time for the politics of intelli\u00ad\ngence.25 Quite understandably, SIS wanted to keep all code\u00ad\nbreaking under its wing, since it was a form of foreign \nintelligence-gathering. Menzies was also adamant that he should \nretain personal control over Ultra.26 If possible, he preferred to \ntake this material to Churchill personally, basking in its reflected \nglory. But he did not know how to manage Bletchley Park, and \nas a result it was under-resourced.27 In the words of one SIS \ncontemporary, Menzies regarded anything to do with personnel \nor administration as 'dirty work', and would go to considerable \nlengths to avoid it.28 \nBletchley Park may have been chaotic, but it was a creative \nand innovative chaos that allowed the code-breakers to make a \nfresh start in the Buckinghamshire countryside.29 The head of \nGC&CS, Alastair Denniston, spent the autumn of 1939 making \ndetailed war preparations. His task was to find new cryptogra\u00ad\nphers to fill out the ranks of Bletchley Park. His valuable contacts \nwith the Poles and their success with the 'bombe' had led him \nSCHOOLDAYS 25 \nto realise that he not only needed more code-breakers, he also \n?eeded mathematically-inclined individuals. Most of the current \ninhabitants of GC&CS were linguists with a penchant for Latin \nand Greek. He now needed people who loved maths and \nmachines, and in September 1939 he was actively scouring the \nhigh tables of Oxbridge colleges for talent. The brilliant new \nmathematicians he recruited included Gordon Welchman from \nTrinity College, Cambridge, who would run the heart of the \ncode-breaking operations in Hut Six. He brought with him Stuart \nMilner-Barry from the same college, who was the chess corre\u00ad\nspondent of The Times and who eventually took over as head of \nHut Six. In turn, Milner-Barry brought fellow members of the \nBritish chess team, Hugh Alexander and Harry Golombek, to \nBletchley.3o \nThese arrivals came not a moment too soon. Hitler's attack \non Poland had tipped Europe into all-out conflict, and Bletchley \nPark was now a fully operational war station. The pressure was \non to make progress against Enigma. The most brilliant mind \nengaged in this task was Alan Mathison Turing, who made an \nearly and important contribution. Despite understanding the \nabstract problems of Enigma some months into the war, GC&CS \nwas having difficulty in breaking any real Enigma messages, \nand was not delivering much product. To have examples of the \nmachine was not enough, since the security of the messages it \nsent depended on the 'key', in other words the settings of the \nmachine, which changed each day. Turing was sent to see the \nremnants of the Polish code-breaking team, now residing near \nParis, to try to work out what the British were doing wrong. \nThe Poles explained that the British had failed to think through \nthe way in which the wiring was attached to the rotors of the \nEnigma machine. \nIn early 1940, with this further helpful shove from its allies, \nBletchley Park began breaking substantial amounts of Enigma \ntraffic. There were many different Enigma cyphers, and to distin\u00ad\nguish them, they were colour-coded. In February 1940, Bletchley \nPark began breaking 'Red', which was an invaluable system \n26 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nused for liaison between the German Army and the Luftwaffe. \nPeriodically, a change to a German cypher system would cause \nthe British code-breakers to lose it for a while, and quite often \nrecovering it depended on second -guessing the lazy habits of \nthe operators. German overconfidence in the improved Enigma \nmachine led to basic mistakes that greatly simplified the task of \nthose whose objective was to tease out the rotor setting for each \nday.31 \nBy early 1941, the flow of material from the breaking of \nEnigma was impressive. The intelligence from Bletchley Park \nwas circulated on a very select basis, and was marked with the \ncode word 'Ultra' to denote the extremely high level of secur\u00ad\nity attached to the material. Menzies showcased his triumph by \ntaking senior figures from Whitehall on day trips to Bletchley \nPark. On II January it was the turn of Alexander Cadogan. He \nnoted in his diary: \n* Cold but thawing. Had a rush at the Fa till II, when I left \nwith Menzies for Bletchley. Got there about 12.30. Very \nInteresting -I should like to spend a week there so as to \ntry and understand it. A charming young Cambridge \nprofessor of geometry -Welshman [Gordon Welchman] -\ndid his best with me. A good show, I think.32 \n* Others soon made the pilgrimage to the strange mock-Thdor \nmansion surrounded by temporary huts. On 6 September 1941 \nWinston Churchill himself, now Prime Minister, stood on a pile \nof bricks left by some workmen alongside Hut Six and gave an \nimpromptu speech -delivered with deep emotion -about the \nvalue of Bletchley Park to the war effort. 33 \nUnbeknown to Churchill, Bletchley Park was in deep crisis. \nThis was partly due to its rapid growth, and partly to the uncer\u00ad\ntain institutional boundaries that were evolving almost daily. \nThe situation was exacerbated by a complex relationship with \nthe 'Y services', the lower-order radio intercept organisations \nrun by the Army, Navy and Air Force that fed Bletchley with \nSCHOOLDAYS 27 \ncaptured traffic. Meanwhile the three armed services were them\u00ad\nselves vying for increased control over who received the output \nfrom GC&CS. This was precisely the kind of complex organisa\u00ad\ntional puzzle that Menzies was ill-equipped to deal with. Matters \nreached a head in the autumn of 1941, forcing Menzies to \nappoint a Joint Committee of Control, which included members \nof both SIS and GC&CS. However, as the historian Philip Davies \nobserves, 'Like so many of Menzies' administrative initiatives, \nthe committee proved unequal to the task:34 There was also a \ngeneral resources problem. Having made significant inroads into \nGerman Enigma traffic, there were simply not enough staff at \nBletchley Park to process the vast torrents of accessible German \ncommunications. Neither Alastair Denniston nor his deputy, \nEdward Travis, had the pull in Whitehall to overcome the \nshortage.35 \nChurchill was not ignorant of this state of affairs for long. \nRecalling the Prime Minister's kind words during his recent visit, \nthe code-breakers resolved to go straight to the top. On 21 \nOctober 1941, four of the most brilliant minds at Bletchley Park, \nHugh Alexander, St!.lart Milner-Barry, Alan Turing and Gordon \nWelchman, wrote directly to Churchill to beg for more resources, \nexplaining that their work was so secret that it was hard to \nexplain their requirements to those who controlled personneU6 \nSo secret was their missive that Milner-Barry took the train to \nLondon and delivered it personally to 10 Downing Street. \nChurchill was shocked by these revelations, and demanded \n'Action This Day'. He ordered his military assistant, General \nHastings 'Pug' Ismay, to ensure that GC&CS had everything it \nneeded, and to report that this had been done.37 As a result, \nBletchley Park underwent a further expansion, and more impor\u00ad\ntantly a major reorganisation.38 \nGC&CS was now divided into two distinct parts, civil and \nmilitary. The end of the Blitz meant that the civil side, which \ndealt with economic and diplomatic traffic, could be sent back \nto London with relative safety. It took up residence in Berkeley \nStreet, partly because the work of attacking diplomatic codes \n28 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \noften had to be coordinated with discreet telephone taps on the \nforeign embassies in London. The military side remained at \nBletchley Park. This did not resolve the heated arguments about \nwho controlled the spoils of GC&CS, but it did address the \nimmediate accommodation problems, and created two organi\u00ad\nsations of a more manageable size. Menzies retained his post \nas overall Director, but was a notably absentee landlord. Alastair \nDenniston was sent to London as Deputy Director (Civil), while \nhis talented deputy, Commander Edward Travis, remained at \nBletchley as Deputy Director (Services).39 Travis was now the \nrising star. 40 \nBritish code-breaking in the early years of the war was not just \nabout the German military secrets revealed through Enigma. \nEven harder to break than the Enigma machine had been a \nGerman teleprinter on-line cypher machine known as 'Tunny', \nused by the German High Command to produce 'Fish' messages. \nOn-line cypher machines were especially challenging because \nthey were automatic, and sent a continuous stream of text, \nmuch of it dummy material, sometimes offering no obvious start \nor end points to each message. This went some way to elimi\u00ad\nnating another weakness of the Enigma machine -its opera\u00ad\ntors, who were prone to human error. To address the problem \nof 'Tunny', the British later built 'Colossus', one of the earliest \ngeneral-purpose electronic machines, and perhaps the first device \nthat might be described as a 'computer'. Conceived by Professor \nMax Newman and then developed by Tommy Flowers from the \nBritish Post Office research facility at Dollis Hill, this was one \nof the supreme technical achievements of the warY \nThe achievements of the civil side of GC&CS have often been \nneglected. By 1940 it was analysing not only the diplomatic \ncodes and cyphers of the Axis powers, but also those of more \nthan twenty other countries. These included the Soviet Union, \nwhich did not enter the war until it was attacked by Germany \non 22 June 1941. The diplomatic communications of quarrel\u00ad\nsome allies such as the Free French, or important neutrals such \nSCHOOLDAYS 29 \nas the Turks and the Spanish, proved as interesting and as useful \nas those of Germany. Moreover, the traffic of Germany's allies, \nsuch as Japan, could shed a penetrating light on the mindset \nof Berlin. Throughout 1941 Hitler held regular meetings with \nBaron Oshima, the Japanese Ambassador in Berlin, often \nreferred to as 'Hitler's Japanese confidant'. Japan had its own \ncomplex cypher, known as 'Magic', produced by a machine \ncalled 'Purple', and Oshima used it to send detailed accounts of \nhis long conversations with Hitler to Tokyo. 'Magic' had been \nbroken by the Americans, and early Anglo-American coopera\u00ad\ntion on code-breaking ensured that all this was being read in \nLondon. Remarkably, Berkeley Street was also working on the \ncyphers of the United States, which did not join the war until \nthe Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.42 \nThe dramatic events of 1941 transformed the course of the \nSecond World War. Although the Battle of Britain had staved \noff the possibility of a German invasion, by the summer of 1941 \nBritain had been fighting for almost two years without a major \nvictory. Therefore, Hitler's bizarre decision to invade Russia in \nJune 1941, which required the legions of the Wehrmacht to \nturn east, provided a welcome breathing space. After Japan's \nattack on Pearl Harbor, Britain, the United States and Russia \nfound themselves ranged together against the Axis in what was \nsoon called the 'Grand Alliance'. Welcome as this was, a genuine \nworld war created new dilemmas for the denizens of Bletchley \nPark, who now confronted the ticklish issue of large-scale Allied \ncooperation in the business of code-breaking. \n2 \nFriends and Allies \n... there is no better analogy than the schoolboy with his stamp \ncollection. \nGC&CS, discussing intelligence cooperation \nwith the Russians in 194)1 \nThe most secret aspect of Bletchley Park's wartime work was \nits dealings with friends and allies. Many have pondered whether \nthe British attacked Soviet codes and cyphers during the Second \nWorld War. The official history of British intelligence insists that \nChurchill ordered this activity to stop in June 1941, following \nHitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, since Moscow had suddenly \nbecome an ally.2 However, it is now clear that this is quite \nuntrue. At the end of October 1941, intelligence chiefs were \nactually discussing the expansion of the sigint organisation in \nIndia, which was then dealing with 'material from Russian, \nPersian and Afghan sources'. Remarkably, it was not yet working \non German traffic3 Moreover, in January 1942, and again in \nearly 1943, the British and the Americans were discussing the \nmutual exchange of intercepted material from 'Slavic nations'.4 \nSoviet cyphers had been the core business for Britain's interwar \ncode-breakers, and work on this material never stopped \ncompletely during the Second World War. \nTo understand why, we must cast our minds back to the \napproach of the war. During the 1930s, GC&CS continued to \nfollow the traffic of the Comintern even after other Soviet \nsystems were lost. This revealed persistent efforts to subvert the \nBritish Empire in locations such as India, Malaya and Hong \nKong. Indeed, the Soviet Union appeared to be in league with \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 31 \nGermany after the Nazi-Soviet Pact of August 1939. It is often \nforgotten that Poland was invaded by Germany and the Soviet \nUnion together. For a nightmare period between August 1939 \nand June 1941, many suspected that Germany, Italy, Japan and \nthe Soviet Union would act in uneasy concert, dividing the \nspoils of the world between them. This was precisely the plan \nthat Germany's Foreign Minister, Baron Joachim von \nRibbentrop, was trying to press upon his irascible master. \nHowever, in the end Adolf Hitler's racist outlook could not \ntolerate the idea of alliance with the Slavic peoples, and he had \nalways declared his desire for 'Lebensraum' in the east.5 \nThroughout this dangerous period, before Hitler and Stalin \nturned upon each other, the Soviet Union remained a key intel\u00ad\nligence target. SIS even organised a secret squadron to conduct \naerial reconnaissance of possible bombing targets deep inside \nsouthern Russia, notably the oilfields. GC&CS developed close \nrelations with code-breakers in the Baltic states who were also \nworking on Soviet codes. A month after the outbreak of war \nwith Germany, Clive Loehnis, a naval officer at GC&CS (who \nwould become Director of GCHQ in the 1960s), told Alastair \nDenniston that additional premises were needed to cope with \nthe increase in the interception of Soviet military traffic, so new \nbuildings were erected at Scarborough.6 With the military chiefs \nkeen to 'get cracking on Russian traffic', Denniston began a \nunique and profitable experiment. In 1939 GC&CS sent a party \nof British sigint operators to Sweden to work secretly out of the \nBritish Embassy in Stockholm, where there was better radio \nreception from Russia. The creation of this forward listening \nstation was fortuitous, since Stalin embarked on the Winter War \nagainst Finland in November 1939, and GC&CS enjoyed a front\u00ad\nseat view of the whole proceedings.7 \nJohn Tiltman remained the key figure in the effort against \nSoviet communications. A colonel in the King's Own Scottish \nBorderers, he was noted for his smart uniform, which included \ntartan trews. However, as the war progressed he came under the \ninfluence of the spirit of Bletchley Park, and was often seen in a \n32 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nbaggy pullover and green corduroy slacks.8 One of his first duties \nwas to visit Helsinki to conclude a deal with the talented Finnish \ncode-breakers. Britain funded the expansion of the Finnish cryp\u00ad\ntographic bureau, ami supplied it with the latest equipment in \nreturn for material on the Soviets. In March 1940, after imposing \na series of humiliating defeats on the Soviets, the Finns signed \nthe Moscow Peace Treaty, ceding about a tenth of their territory. 9 \nThe sigint deal with the British was unaffected, and indeed in \nSeptember 1940 its scope was expanded during a visit by Admiral \nGodfrey, the Director of Naval Intelligence. According to an internal \nGC&CS history written after the war, 'The Finns had agreed to \nsupply us with copies of all their intercepts and cryptographic \nsuccesses, provided that we did the same.' Preceding the agree\u00ad\nment with the Americans by more than a year, this was perhaps \nBritain's first comprehensive sigint alliance.lO \nBy March 1940, the interception of Soviet traffic was big busi\u00ad\nness. For the first time, collection began in the Middle East, at \nSarafand in Palestine, although it was still sent to India for analysis. \nSoviet traffic was also being taken at Ismailia in Egypt and Dingli \nin Malta. Meanwhile, in Hong Kong, other British sigint opera\u00ad\ntors were also listening to the Soviets before they packed up their \nequipment to move to Singapore in anticipation of a Japanese \nattack. The surge of Soviet traffic meant changes were required \nat GC&CS, where an inter-service Soviet section was created to \nwork in close conjunction on naval, military, air, diplomatic and \ncommercial material. After the fall of France in the summer of \n1940, evacuated French cryptographers joined the effort on Soviet \ntraffic at GC&CS. A Polish section, based at Stanmore on the \nnorthern fringes of London, soon discovered that it was able to \nlisten in to Soviet traffic as far away as Ukraine.ll \nUltra had provided Bletchley Park with an intimate picture of \nthe build-up of German forces in the east, prior to their attack \non the Soviet Union. As early as January 1941 it was clear that \nHitler's vast armies were being moved eastwards in preparation \nfor some grand project. Yet even with the evidence of many \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 33 \nGerman divisions massing in the east, Whitehall refused to \nbelieve that Hitler was mad enough to deliberately opt for war \non two fronts. Like Stalin himself, the British Chiefs of Staff \nbelieved that this was more likely to be a prelude to a German \nultimatum, a bluff in which Hitler would demand the cession \nof some further territory in Eastern Europe. Throughout early \n1941, Stalin believed that all war warnings were self-serving \nefforts at deception by the West, which sought to provoke a \nwar between Germany and the Soviet Union. Stalin has \nfrequently been ridiculed for ignoring the warning signs of the \nimpending attack, but despite the benefits of Ultra, it was only \nthe month before the fateful date of 22 June 1941 that British \nintelligence chiefs realised what was about to occur. 12 \nHitler's decision to turn east was a fabulous stroke of luck for \nBritain. At a time when its forces were struggling, this was a \nmost welcome redirection of the main German war effort. Taken \ntogether with Pearl Harbor at the end of the year, it is right to \nregard 1941 as nothing less than the fulcrum of the war. However, \nBletchley Park now faced a new problem. Should it pass sensi\u00ad\ntive intelligence derived from Ultra to the new Soviet ally, which \nhad been a dedicated enemy of Britain since 19177 The idea \nthat two of Britain's adversaries were about to fight to the death \nfilled most military intelligence officers with ill-disguised glee. \nMany argued that passing sigint to the Soviets was pointless, \nsince few expected them to hold out later than 1942. Others \ninsisted that not even Ultra could penetrate the fog of self\u00ad\ndeception with which Stalin had surrounded himself.13 \nIn the event, Bletchley Park did develop a precarious sigint \nliaison with the Soviets. When the British Chiefs of Staff \ndespatched a military mission to Moscow, the code-breakers \ndecided to work through it to find out what the Soviets were \ndoing. They began cautiously, asking about 'low-grade material \nonly', notably German Air Force three-letter tactical codes. They \nintended to send an officer from Bletchley, and in the long term \neven hoped to persuade the Soviets to accept a British Y unit, \nor forward listening station, that would intercept German tactical \n34 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nmessages on their front. In late 1941 the Soviets agreed to a \nvisit from Squadron Leader G.R. Scott-Farnie, who worked on \nBritain's Y interception system in the Middle East.14 \nScott-Farnie gave the Soviets a good deal of information on \nlow-grade German Air Force systems, but quickly came up against \na different culture of intelligence exchangeY The Soviets adored \ncaptured documents, and did not attach much credence to any \ninformation that was not supported by such evidence. Once the \ngame of document exchange began, Scott-Farnie discovered that \nthe Soviet approach 'was precisely that of a horse dealer who \nenjoys the poste and riposte of a bargain, and they looked at \nthe exchange of documents on an eye for an eye basis' .16 \nBletchley now had to decide whether to follow up the Scott\u00ad\nFarnie Mission. Alastair Denniston was 'full of hesitation because \nof the continued Soviet retreat before the German onslaught', \nbut the intelligence directorates of Britain's three armed ser\u00ad\nvices thought it worthwhile. Josh Cooper, who had reviewed \nthe exchanged material, concluded that the Soviets were \n'absolute beginners' in their work on the German Air Force, \nbut thought they should be shown the RAF Y stations at \nKingsdown in Kent and Cheadle in Cheshire to point them in \nthe right direction. If the Soviets were impressed, he added, \nthey might allow a British Y unit to be sent to the Soviet UnionY \nIn the end, Edward Crankshaw, an Army Y Service officer, was \nsent out, armed with more barter material in the form of docu\u00ad\nments. This was to be 'swapped' with the Soviet interceptors, \nsince Bletchley Park thought 'there is no better analogy than \nthe schoolboy with his stamp collection'. By the spring of 1942 \nCrankshaw was established in the Soviet Union, and was trading \nhis wares.IS However, the greatest success in the Soviet Union \nwas achieved by the Royal Navy. It was running supply convoys \nto the Russian port of Murmansk, and this justified the setting \nup of a radio station at the nearby town of Polyarnoe. A small \nnaval Y intercept party was soon attached to it, and began co\u00ad\noperating with the Soviets on low-level German naval commu\u00ad\nnications. This kept going until December 1944, and yielded \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 35 \ngood material on subjects such as the movements of the German \nbattleship Tirpitz in northern waters.!9 \nThe main worry about giving Ultra to the Soviets was the \ninsecurity of their own ryphers -in 1942, Bletchley Park was \nincreasingly aware of the German ability to read a great deal \nof Soviet operational military traffic in the field. Frederick \nWinterbotham, who worked on sigint distribution, argued that \nMoscow simply had to be told about the weak security of its \ncyphers. However, Winterbotham's colleagues insisted that it \nwas 'impossible' to tell the Soviets, even though he had 'invented \na good cover story\" to explain how they knew.20 The secret truth \nwas that Bletchley Park was collecting second-hand sigint. The \nGermans were sending their own sigint from the Eastern Front \nback to Berlin using an Enigma key code-named 'Mustard', \nwhich in turn was being read by the British. Although much \nof the sigint obtained from the Soviets was operational, the \nBritish also noted that 'first grade traffic can be read -at least \nin part' by the Germans. Some of the German successes had \nstemmed from a Soviet codebook, 'OKK-5', known to have \nbeen captured by the Finns and given to the Germans. While \nthe British had struggled to break these codes in the 1930s, the \nGermans were having more success.2! On 16 June 1942, Nigel \nde Grey, the Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, stepped in and \nsettled the argument. He noted that Edward Crankshaw, the \nGC&CS liaison with the Soviets, would soon be returning from \nMoscow for another visit. He would be ordered to give the \nSoviets the details of their compromised cyphers and 'the \nmethods of reading'. This decision probably reflected the fact \nthat, against all predictions, the Soviet forces were hanging on \nimpressively and looked as if they were going to be in the war \nfor some time to come.22 \nIn August 1942, Crankshaw briefed the Soviets on their \nappalling lack of security, typified by their alarming tendency to \nuse low-grade cyphers for high-grade secrets.23 There was abun\u00ad\ndant evidence of this in German Air Force Enigma, but Crankshaw \nonly hinted at it by 'somewhat tenuous means'. Predictably, the \n36 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nSoviets would not accept his warnings because 'direct evidence \nwas not forthcoming'. Depressed, he went back to Bletchley Park \nin February 1943, never to return to Moscow. He joined the staff \nat Bletchley Park amI tried to keep the relationship going at a \ndistance, 'but the temperature was falling'. The Director, \nCommander Edward navis, was only willing to allow the rela\u00ad\ntionship to continue 'if it is a solid gain for us'. The Polyarnoe \nnaval listening station continued to function, but with the Soviets \nturning the tide on the Eastern Front they seemed to feel no \nneed for further cooperation, and other contacts 'petered out' .24 \nOn 9 February 1944, London discussed the possibility of a visit \nto Britain by Soviet cypher experts and decided against it.2s \nBletchley Park's heated debate on what information to give \nto the Soviets was academic. All along, one of the KGB's top \nagents, John Cairncross, had been working at Bletchley. \nAlthough Cairncross studied at Cambridge in the early 1930s, \nhe was not recruited by Anthony Blunt, one of the key KGB \ntalent scouts there, who found him both quarrelsome and arro\u00ad\ngant. Instead, after Cairncross joined the Foreign Office in 1936, \nhe was persuaded to work for Soviet intelligence by James \nKlugman, a prominem British Communist, who later served in \nthe wartime Special Operations Executive. Although Cairncross \nwas fearsomely intelligent, his difficult personality ensured that \nhe was always being moved on. At the outbreak of the war \nwith Germany he was sent to the Cabinet Office to work for \nthe Cabinet Secretary, Lord Hankey. There he saw some of the \nearly British thinking on the development of the atomic bomb. \nIn 1941 he was moved to Bletchley Park, labouring in Hut Three \non the Luftwaffe order of battle. His moment of triumph came \nin early 1943 when he was able to warn his KGB controller of \nthe impending German armoured offensive at Kursk. Code\u00ad\nnamed 'Operation Citadel', this was the last great German push \non the Eastern Front. It proved to be the largest tank battle of \nthe Second World War, and the information provided by \nCairncross proved to be important in launching an early attack \nupon the German tactical air force, much of which was destroyed \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 37 \non the ground. Stalin later awarded him the Order of the Red \nBanner in recognition of his achievement.26 \nSoon after Kursk, Cairncross moved again. He now returned \nto London and ended up in Section V, the counter-intelligence \nsection of SIS, working alongside Kim Philby. Although he worked \nwith Philby, Guy Burgess and indeed Donald Maclean, Cairncross \nwas unaware of their common allegiance to Moscow, and believed \nhe was the sole high-grade KGB agent in Whitehall. Bizarrely, he \nwas caught in 1951 because of an official note in his handwriting \nfound in the flat of Guy Burgess after Burgess had fled to Moscow \nwith Maclean. Cairncross had given Burgess this quite innocently \nin the course of official business, without knowing he was a fellow \nspy. Once the note was found, Cairncross was followed, and MI5 \nsurveillance believed they had caught him trying to meet with \nhis KGB controller. Without hard evidence he could not be pros\u00ad\necuted, and he was merely asked to resign. Ironically, the Ultra \nmaterial that Cairncross passed to the KGB was taken more seri\u00ad\nously by Moscow precisely because it was stolen. Had the British \nhanded it willingly to their ally, Stalin's suspicious mind would \nalmost certainly have devalued it.27 \nCairncross was not the only KGB agent with access to Ultra. \nIn late 1942, Anthony Blunt, another high-grade Soviet agent, \nwas designated one of the two MI5 liaison officers who worked \nclosely with Bletchley Park.28 Anxiety about KGB agents and \nsubversion was yet another reason that the British kept working \non Soviet traffic. Monitoring stations, notably the Metropolitan \nPolice intercept station at Denmark Hill in south London, \nreported an upswing in traffic between Moscow and secret \nagents in Britain. There was also a British field unit, called the \nRadio Security Service, that hunted for illegal agent radio trans\u00ad\nmissions, and it told the same story, although the agent traffic \n\" could not be broken.29 John Croft, who worked at the GC&CS \ndiplomatic code-breaking centre at Berkeley Street in London, \nwas one of those who soldiered on with Soviet material. Croft \nwas engaged on wartime Comintern traffic in Europe, known \nas 'Isco!', which could be read. Although circulated only to a \n38 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nvery select group of individuals within Whitehall, this material \nmostly revealed a dutiful Soviet struggle against their shared \nenemy, Nazi Germany. There is no indication that this material \nwas exchanged with Washington.3o \nEarly British cooperation with the American code-breakers \nwas also tentative. Again, the obstacle was obsessive security. \nSecurity problems existed on several different levels. The British \nand the Americans had cooperated on sigint during the First \nWorld War, but this had bequeathed a legacy of doubt and anxiety, \neven distrust. In November 1940, when reviving sigint cooper\u00ad\nation with the Americans was discussed, Alastair Denniston was \nquick to point out that after the First World War the 'notorious' \nAmerican code-breaker Herbert O. Yardley had published a \ntell-all book about his experiences. The very name 'Yardley' \ncaused a shudder in British code-breaking circles. Yardley was \nnow working for the Canadians, and GC&CS insisted that they \nsack him summarily before they were allowed to join the wartime \nsigint club.3l Indeed, the Canadians were told that other agen\u00ad\ncies 'would not touch Yardley with a ten foot pole'.n \nThe British, and especially Sir Stewart Menzies, the Chief of \nSIS, were frosty towards the Americans, and regarded them as \nfundamentally insecure. By contrast, the Americans generously \nopted to share the secret of their spectacular code-breaking success \nagainst the Japanese 'Magic' diplomatic cypher with the British \nas early as January 1941, even handing over precious examples \nof their copies of the Japanese cypher machine. The British were \n'flabbergasted'. They did not expect the Americans to 'simply \nwalk in and plonk down their most secret cryptanalytical \nmachine'.}} Yet the British remained reticent, and did not initially \nreciprocate fully with their knowledge of Enigma. The jibe about \nAmerican insecurity had a certain irony, since the British chose \nto send one of the priceless American copies of the 'Purple' \nmachine out to their naval base at Singapore shortly before it \nfell to the Japanese. The machine was delivered by ship just as \nthe Japanese invasion of Malaya began, and disappeared into the \nchaos of battle. To this day its fate is unknown.34 \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 39 \nCollaboration with Washington was also hard because \nAmerican sigint was a house divided. Although William \nFriedman, the US Army's best cryptologist, was busy advocating \nsigint cooperation with the British in early 1940, the US Navy's \nchief code-breaker, Commander Laurance Safford, was \nadamantly set against working with allies. But after pressure \nfrom President Franklin D. Roosevelt the Navy had been won \nround, and the Americans sent a team of technical experts to \nBritain in early 1941. Known as the 'Sinkov Mission', they spent \nseveral weeks touring Bletchley Park and visiting outlying inter\u00ad\ncept stations. The British were willing to receive them because \nthey knew the main focus of American attention was Japan. \nAt this stage the British were keen to keep discussions focused \non Japan, because this allowed them to hide the extent of their \nknowledge of the German Enigma system. Both Sir Stewart \nMenzies and Sir Alexander Cadogan were adamant that the \nUltra secret would not be shared with the Americans.35 Laurance \nSafford later represented the first Anglo-American exchanges \nof late 1940 and early 1941 as a one-way street in which the \nAmericans handed over their precious 'Magic' material on Japan \nbut got nothing in return. In fact this is far from the case. \nPrescott Currier, one of the Americans who came to Bletchley \nin early 1941, recalled: 'All of us were permitted to come and \ngo freely and to visit and talk with anyone in any area that \ninterested US.'36 Later that year, a select circle of American code\u00ad\nbreakers were also given more details about Enigma.37 \nThe hottest issue was the distribution of sigint to the policy\u00ad\nmakers. In late May 1941, Brigadier Raymond Lee, the American \nMilitary Attache in London, conveyed an American request for \ncomprehensive intelligence exchange in the Far East. There \nfollowed painfully slow and complex discussions about who would \nget sigint with what levels of security: 'The whole thing has been \nso tangled up,' he complained.38 Sigint was also very confused \nin Washington. Unlike Britain's GC&CS, American signals intel\u00ad\nligence was less centrally organised, resulting in great rivalry \nbetween the armed services.39 Because the American wartime \n40 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nsigint organisation was divided between the Army and the Navy, \none of the great problems for the British was cooperating with \none without upsetting the other. Famously, the Americans solved \nthe tussle over who would decrypt Japanese codes by agreeing \nthat the Army would decode the material on the even days of \nthe month, and the Navy on the odd days. A more ludicrous \nsystem for the division of labour would have been hard to devise.40 \nGC&CS might have been more centralised than the Americans, \nbut it had less money. Expanded cooperation with America on \nJapan allowed GC&CS to shed some difficult code-breaking tasks. \nHigh-grade Japanese Army cyphers had proved impenetrable for \na decade. By 1941, Bletchley Park was too busy with the European \nwar, while its Far Eastern code-breakers were struggling to cope \nwith the mass of material on Japanese espionage derived from \nlow-level consular intercepts in South-East Asia. On 22 August \n1941, Anglo-American cooperation lifted this task from their \nshoulders. During talks in Washington, Alastair Denniston \npersuaded the US Army that it should 'take over investigation \nof Japanese main army cipher soon as priority commitment'. \nShortly after, Captain Geoffrey Stevens from Singapore travelled \nto Washington carrying all the British material on the Japanese \nmain army cypher.41 The British were glad to see the back of it. \nAt the end of the war approximately 2,500 Americans would still \nbe working on this one Japanese cypher to no avail. \nAll the while, Britain was also de cyphering some American \ntraffic. Amongst the decrypts selected for the personal perusal of \nWinston Churchill were those of many Allied and neutral coun\u00ad\ntries. GC&CS was clearly working successfully on the American \ndiplomatic code 'Grey' until December 1941.42 Remarkably, there \nwas no embarrassment about this. In June 1941, while discussing \ncomprehensive sharing of Far East intelligence, the British asked \nthe US Military Attachc\\ General Raymond Lee, for his opinion \non the security of American cyphers. This was the conduit through \nwhich sigint would pass between London and Washington. Lee \nreplied tardy that the GC&CS already knew a great deal about \nthis matter. He recorded in his diary: \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES \n* The talk then turned again on the question of security. They \nwanted to know whether my despatches went by radio or \ncable and were relieved to hear that they went by cable, \nand were further relieved to hear that we have a direct \nwire straight into the War Department. However, I pointed \nout that this wire was subject to interception by their people \nhere in England [GC&CS] and I had no doubt they had \ntaken our messages and attempted to decipher them. \n* 41 \nHe added that it was now very much in the interests of GC&CS \nto be honest about the :;ecurity of American cypher systems, \n'because the stuff that is going over it is more vital to them \nthan to us'. Lee's frank exchange with the British underlines \none of the hidden benefits of cooperation between the Allied \ncode-breakers. Once they began to share their most precious \nassets, 'Magic' and then eventually Ultra, improved communi\u00ad\ncations security became paramount. London and Washington \nnow had a vested interest in the impenetrability of each other's \nmessages. After all, if GC&CS could break American codes, then \nso, perhaps, could the Germans.43 \nChurchill eventually wrote to Roosevelt and owned up to British \nwork on American diplomatic codes. 'From the moment we became \nallies: he explained, 'I gave instructions that this work should \ncease. However, danger of our enemies having achieved a measure \nof success cannot, I am advised, be dismissed: In fact, it is unlikely \nthat all work on American traffic ceased. In areas such as the \nMiddle East, Britain had a considerable incentive to continue to \nwork on American commercial traffic, much of which was in \ncommercial code or plain text. Indeed, a close reading of Churchill's \nassurance to Roosevelt suggests that it might have related to diplo\u00ad\nmatic traffic only.44 Some GC&CS staff recall work on the traffic \nof American commercial attaches throughout the war, although \nas yet no documents have been released.45 Predictably, clear traffic \nfrom American oil companies was being intercepted in 1944 as \nthey began to look for new markets in Europe.46 \n42 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nFor this very reason, the US Army and Navy were agreed that \nnothing should be passed to the British about American code\u00ad\nmaking procedures, such as the Sigaba cypher machine. General \nGeorge Marshall, the us Army Chief of Staff, specifically forbade \nany such exchange in September 1940.47 Anxiety about protecting \nnational cypher systems persisted through the war on both sides \nof the Atlantic. In February 1945 Britain's newly formed Cypher \nPolicy Board debated a proposal by its Secretary, Captain Edmund \nWilson, for 'free and complete interchange' with the Americans \non cypher machine development, together with scrambler phones \nand secure speech.48 This horrified both Edward Bridges, the \nCabinet Secretary, and Sir Stewart Menzies, Chief of SIS, and the \nidea was rejected. Cooperation on communications security would \nfocus on machines specially designed for combined use.49 \nThe gradual collapse of the British monopoly over Ultra intelli\u00ad\ngence paved the way for closer Anglo-American sigint coopera\u00ad\ntion. As we have seen, Bletchley's initial idea for wartime \ncooperation was that the Americans would continue their pre\u00ad\nwar focus on Japanese traffic; meanwhile the British would handle \nthe work on Enigma, dispensing its product to the Americans as \nthey saw fit. Although they had informed the Americans about \nEnigma in 1941, some precise details of processing had been \nwithheld. Bletchley was determined to prevent the Americans \nworking on Enigma in parallel, even though the Battle of the \nAtlantic gave Washington a legitimate need for Ultra intelligence. \nHowever, once the German Navy introduced an improved Enigma \nmachine with four rotors, the British could not produce enough \n'bombes' to deal with the increased number of tests required to \nbreak it.50 In September 1942, Joseph Wenger, who led the US \nNavy code-breakers, proposed spending $2 million to acquire no \nfewer than 230 four-wheel 'bombes'. This was ten times the \nnumber available to Bletchley. John TIltman, Britain's Soviet code \nspecialist, realised that American sigint was beginning to operate \non an industrial scale, and that for Bletchley Park the game of \n'Ultra monopoly' was surely Up.51 \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 43 \nIn September 1942, Edward Travis and the head of Bletchley \nPark's Naval Section, Frank Birch, travelled to Washington and \nconcluded the 'Holden Agreement', which established full and \nintegrated collaboration on German naval traffic, including \nEnigma. This was a key part of the emerging Anglo-American \nsigint relationship, and a constituent part of the secret alliance \nwhich still exists to this day. 52 Travis's hand was strengthened \nby the remarkable fact that the US Navy breathed not a word \nabout the Holden Agreement to the US Army. The British there\u00ad\nfore persisted in their hopes of keeping control over the processing \nof Ultra material derived from Luftwaffe and German Army \ntraffic. Nigel de Grey, the Deputy Director of Bletchley Park, was \napoplectic at the possibility of the Americans being allowed to \nduplicate further British work on Enigma. However, a US Army \ncode-breaker based at Bletchley, Colonel Telford Taylor, suggested \na tactful way forward. He advised his superiors in Washington \nthat all they needed for the time being was a small 'foothold' \nin the work on Enigma, which would allow them to gain experi\u00ad\nence. More level-headed organisational types at Bletchley Park, \nsuch as Gordon Welchman, could see that the ability of the \nAmericans to procure unlimited numbers of bombes was crucial, \nadding, 'We certainly need help.'53 The result was the BRUSA \nagreement, a further crucial landmark in the construction of the \nAnglo-American sigint relationship. On 17 May 1943, Bletchley \nagreed to American participation in work on German Army and \nAir Force traffic. A second Holden Agreement on naval sigint \nfollowed in 1944. These treaties were of enormous importance, \nand paved the way for more ambitious post-war sigint alliances. \nThe exigencies of war had broken Britain's cryptographic \nmonopoly on Ultra. However, Ultra was a military system, repre\u00ad\nsenting the core work of Bletchley Park. There is no evidence \nthat Britain and the United States concluded an overarching \ntreaty on dipiomatic or commercial sigint, the material that \nGC&CS worked on at Berkeley Street. In 1942, Alastair \nDenniston, who had been moved sideways to manage diplo\u00ad\nmatic sigint, arranged for cooperation on a number of specific \n44 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \ncountries such as Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Japan and, of \ncourse, Germany. However, this was done on an ad hoc basis. \nThere was no diplomatic BRUSA agreement. It seems that the \nAmericans were not intercepting and working on a range of \nmaterials that would have prompted a wider deal. Typically, \nDenniston told John Tiltman, with evident relief, 'They do no \nwork on any of the Near Eastern governments.'54 \nDenniston's main point of contact in the United States was \nWilliam Friedman and the US Army code-breakers, who domi\u00ad\nnated American work on diplomatic systems. The Americans were \nkeen to cooperate, since up until 1941 the US Army had been \nintensely focused on the diplomatic cyphers of Japan. In 1940 \nthe Americans lost access to Japan's diplomatic cypher, and it \nwas only recovered as the result of a prodigious effort by a team \nunder Frank Rowlett. By contrast, British code-breakers were \nworking on the diplomatic cyphers of some twenty-six different \ncountries.55 Therefore, when the Americans offered access to \n'Magic', the British reciprocated with a wide range of diplomatic \nmaterial, including high-grade Italian systems. Then, in March \n1942, John Tiltrr.an visited Washington and brought with him \nSpanish and Vichy French cyphers. Given the arrival of American \nforces in the Mediterranean, this was valuable material. By 1944 \nthe Americans had received more material from the British on \ndiplomatic cyphers used by the Greeks, Hungarians, Iranians and \nIraqis. However, the processing went on behind a curtain. \nDenniston asked at one point, 'Do they actually work on the \nstuff which we send them, or do they simply put it in their \nlibrary?' Diplomatic cyphers from countries that the British consid\u00ad\nered to be client states, such as Egypt, were withheld. 56 \nSharing diplomatic product caused some embarrassing prob\u00ad\nlems. Foreign diplomats in London or Washington often reported \ntheir conversations with British officials in the messages they \nsent home. The British sometimes did not want the Americans \nto 'listen in' on these conversations, since they might involve \n, disparaging remarks about American policy or officials'. \nTherefore, they developed a special reserved series called 'Res', \nFRIENDS AND ALLIES 45 \nthat co!1tained material that was not to be given to the Americans. \nThis was not an effective solution, because, as Alexander \nCadogan, the senior official at the Foreign Office, explained to \nStewart Menzies, the Americans would often obtain and break \nsome of the same traffic themselves, and so would 'become suspi\u00ad\ncious'. By the spring of 1944 the Americans dearly knew about \n'Res', and pressed the British to abandon the practice. However, \nCadogan refused, since the war was drawing to an end, and the \nantagonistic politics of post-war settlements were looming. 57 \nThe Americans nurtured their own anxieties. Would Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican sigint cooperation continue after the war? As early \nas 1942, Colonel Alfred McCormack, one of the more impor\u00ad\ntant visitors to Bletchley, warned his superiors in Washington \nthat the British were 'very realistic people', and so would \n'certainly at some time -possibly while the war is still on -\nresume work on United States communications'.58 However, \ncontinued convergence of Anglo-American sigint was ensured \nby early fears of the Soviet Union, which were visible as early \nas 1942. Senior officers on both sides of the Atlantic, induding \nField Marshal Lord Alanbrooke and General Douglas MacArthur, \nwere of one mind on the 'Russia problem'. On 31 July 1942, \nGeoffrey Stevens, a code-breaker from GC&CS, went out to \nArlington Hall, the US Army's code-breakers' centre in \nWashington. One of the subjects he discussed there was the \nSoviet Union, and he was fascinated to learn that the Americans \nwere intercepting all the Soviet traffic in and out of Washington. \nThey were also collecting Soviet traffic elsewhere, for example \nbetween Moscow and the Soviet Embassy in Tokyo. He reported \nthat the Americans 'do nothing about it at the moment' by way \nof decryption, since they were so pressed for code-breaking \ncapacity against the Axis. However, sooner or later, he added, \n'They will inevitably try and break this since they do not trust \nthe Soviets further than they could throw a steam-roller. '59 Much \nas Stevens predicted, the Americans began a Soviet Group in \nFebruary 1943. Meanwhile, the British moved their own existing \nSoviet team from Ryder Street in London to larger premises at \n46 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nSloane Square in late 1944.60 Although the two allies were still \nworking in isolation on the 'Russia problem', the foundation of \nfuture collaboration was already emerging. \nAnxiety about the Soviet Union increased markedly during \nearly 1944. By April the Red Army was pushing into eastern \nHungary, and this filled Moscow with a newfound confidence. \nStalin's determination to impose a Communist government on \nPoland was already evident, and pointed to future trouble. Some \nBritish diplomats in the Foreign Office remained hopeful about \nthe possibility of post-war cooperation with the Soviet Union, \nbut their military colleagues did not share their optimism. \nIndeed, the main future strategic planning body in Whitehall, \nthe Post Hostilities Planning Committee, which was shared \nbetween the diplomats and the military, tore itself apart over \nthis issue. The Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden had to step in \nin late 1944, and banned the further circulation of its papers. \nOne staff officer lamented that there were to be 'no more games \nof Russian scandal'. Russia was now a forbidden subject, and \nbetween late 1944 and early 1946 Britain's main body of intel\u00ad\nligence analysts, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), did \neverything it could to avoid discussing the dreaded subject of \nthe Soviet Union.61 \nAccordingly, it was only in June 1945 that the American \ncode-breakers formally proposed to the British that they co\u00ad\noperate against the Soviet Union, giving the overall programme \nthe code name 'Bourbon'. The formal Anglo-American collab\u00ad\noration on the wider 'Russian problem' was so incredibly secret \nthat it was not written down, and amounted to a simple hand\u00ad\nshake between Group Captain Eric Jones, the British sigint \nliaison officer in Washington, and a senior American naval \nofficer in June 1945. Meanwhile, all eyes were on the Allied \nreoccupation of Europe and the remarkable sigint prizes that \nwere even now being recovered from the smouldering ruins of \nthe Third Reich.62 \n3 \nEvery War Must Have an End \nOn 26th August one of the [German] operators from Army Group, \nSouth Ukraine ... suddenly broke into violent remarks about \nHitler, using the peculiarly foul language in which the Germans \ndelight. The operator at Supreme Army Command tried to shut \nhim up in equally filthy language. This interchange lasted for \nabout ten minutes ... \nThe incident is only noteworthy as a possible indication of the \nway things are going. \nNigel de Grey, Deputy Director at Bletchley Park, \nto Sir Stewart Menzies, 14 September 19441 \nBy the autumn of 1944 the Second World War was ending and \nthe Cold War had, to all intents and purposes, already begun. \nIn the east, the German Army was collapsing fast, and by \nSeptember Soviet forces were at the borders of Prussia. A month \nlater, American forces had entered Germany from the west, \ncapturing the ancient town of Aachen. While much bitter \nfighting lay ahead, the minds of officials in London, Washington \nand Moscow were increasingly focused on the post-war settle\u00ad\nment. Wartime relations with Russia had never been easy. \nStalin's intense and unwavering suspicion was underlined by \nthe fact that, throughout the war, he had refused to leave Soviet\u00ad\ncontrolled territory to meet Churchill and Roosevelt. Harsh \nSoviet behaviour in newly occupied areas like Poland already \npointed to post-war confrontation and rivalry, and all eyes were \non the advance into Germany. \nBritain and the United States were gearing up for piratical \nraids on the headquarters and laboratories of a collapsing Third \nReich, and Axis sigint material was the treasure that was most \nactively sought. A joint Anglo-American planning group began \nconsulting with Bletchley Park about what material it wished \nto scoop from an occupied Germany. By early 1945, Intelligence \n48 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nAssault Units were moving into Germany alongside the fighting \nelements of Allied formations, looking for all kinds of top-secret \nGerman experimental weapons. Bletchley Park despatched its \nown Target Intelligence Committee teams, known as 'TICOM \nteams', made up of a mixture of British and American personnel, \nto seek out cryptographic equipment and sigint personnel from \nGermany. The whole TICOM programme was run on what \nCommander Edward Travis called 'an entirely inter-allied' basis.2 \nSuddenly, boffins in glasses and cardigans found themselves \nturned into amateur commandos. Whisked away to a quarry \nnear Bletchley, those selected for this task were given a short \ncourse in the use of sub-machine guns and hand grenades. They \nbegan on the Thompson sub-machine gun, but soon found the \nlighter Sten gun to be an easier weapon to handle. None of \nthem performed well, but nevertheless they were soon on their \nway to Hitler's 'Alpine Lair' at Berchtesgaden. Major Edward \nRushworth, one of the senior British officers from Hut Three, \nled a TICOM team of a dozen officers, accompanied by Selmer \nNorland, an American stationed at Bletchley Park. They arrived \nat the major Ger:rnan headquarters at Augsburg on 8 May, \nVE-Day. Augsburg had been home to the famous German 'Fish', \nor Geheimschreiber, the encyphered teleprinter which Bletchley \nhad eventually defeated with the mighty 'Colossus' computer. \nSadly, all these beautiful machines, lovingly manufactured by \nLorenz, had been smashed and the cypher wheels had gone. \nThe dejected team surveyed the debris. However, a day later \ntheir spirits rebounded when they gleefully recovered a single \nintact late-model 'Fish' from a town on the Austrian border.3 \nOn 12 May 1945 they reached Hitler's Alpine retreat. The \nFuhrer's accommodation had been heavily bombed, but a \nhundred feet below ground was a maze of bunkers and tunnels \nto explore, including an emergency power station and a complete \ntelephone exchange. No more cypher machines seemed to be \nin evidence, and the mission was tailing off when, as a last task, \nRushworth set off for nearby Rosenheim on the Austrian border, \nto question a cryptographer who had been working for the \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 49 \nGerman High Command (OKW). While they were there, a group \nof other German prisoners sent a message asking to speak to \nthe 'proper people'. This team had served in the OKW head\u00ad\nquarters sigint units and 110W revealed that, terrified of the rapid \nSoviet advance, they had buried their equipment under the \npavement in front of their headquarters. Called 'OKW-Chi', they \nhad successfully broken what was referred to as 'Russian Fish'. \nThis was an encrypted Soviet military teleprinter that achieved \nan early version of packet switching, breaking each message \ninto nine different parts and routing it along separate channels, \nbefore reassembling it. The Germans had already worked out \nthat their code-breaking triumph would have post-war value, \nand hoped to sell themselves on as a complete team.4 \nThey were not disappointed. By 23 May they had been encour\u00ad\naged to unearth and set up their equipment, allowing them to \nresume decrypting Soviet command traffic. The Bletchley team \nwere in awe of this vast technical display, which was eventu\u00ad\nally packaged up again in over a hundred boxes and chests. The \neight tons of equipment and the complete German staff were \nloaded onto five lorries, which then wound their way slowly \nthrough a devastated Germany towards Bletchley. They arrived \non 6 June 1945, and the equipment was set up and tested at \nthe nearby radio station of Wavendon Manor.5 The German \nteam was later employed intercepting Soviet encyphered \nteleprinter traffic which the British code-named 'Caviar', and \nalthough the messages were mostly about administration rather \nthan policy or strategy, they provided rare insights into the daily \nactivities of Soviet armed forces in post-war Europe.6 More treas\u00ad\nures followed, and ultimately a further five tons of documents \npertaining to Soviet codes and cyphers would arrive. In mid\u00ad\nJune, Edward Travis asked Russell Dudley-Smith, a senior \nBletchley Park officer, to try to establish some priority in \nexploiting the mountain of material now pouring in, but little \ndid they know that they would still be working on this mate\u00ad\nrial in 1951.7 One-of-a-kind equipment stayed in Britain, while \nany duplicates were shipped to America.8 \n50 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nYet another important haul was brought in by Colonel Paul \nNeff, an American who headed TICOM Team 6. This group \nincluded William Bundy, later US Assistant Secretary of State \nunder President Lyndon B. Johnson, and Geoffrey Stevens from \nBletchley Park. In April 1945 they pushed into southern \nGermany at Magdeburg, near Leipzig, and took control of a \ncastle at Burgscheidungen which had recently been the head\u00ad\nquarters of a code-breaking unit of the German Foreign Ministry \ncalled the Balkanabteilung, whose tasks had largely focused on \nSoviet and Balkan traffic. The fourteen staff and their docu\u00ad\nments were flown to Britain and taken to Bletchley Park. \nBurgscheidungen was in an area that would later be designated \nas part of the Soviet Zone, so Neff destroyed all traces of the \nGerman code-breakers' presence before departing.9 \nThe British caught Generalmajor Klemme, the Senior \nCommander of Radio Intelligence for the Luftwaffe, at the \nHusum-Milstedt intercept station on 19 May 1945. At first he \nwas taken to Neumuenster Prison, but from there he was \nbrought to Britain, and worked with the Allies on sigint in \nGermany until 10 March 1948, when he was considered to \nhave been drained of all he knew about Soviet communications. \nOn 1 May 1945, Major Oeljeschaeger and Major Beulmann \nfrom the Berlin Cryptographic Centre, which had been based \nin a stable block of the Marstall-Neues Palais at Potsdam, had \nfled in the direction of Hitler's complex at Berchtesgaden. A \nfew days later, with the Allies closing in, they stopped at Viehoff \nto burn all the records of Branch 3, and they fell into Allied \nhands on 22 May near Munich. On 5 July they were flown to \nBritain and placed in a special camp. They were surprised to \nbe welcomed by their Branch Chief, Lt Colonel Friedrich, who \nhad been captured before them. By June 1945 the British and \nAmericans had scooped up most of the senior Luftwaffe sigint \nofficers whose traffic they had listened to assiduously for much \nof the war. 10 \nThe TICOM teams were competing with the Soviets, who \nwere also swooping on German cryptographic assets. To their \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 51 \nsurprise, Bletchley Park discovered that the Soviets had taken \nover some German Enigma-based communications nets and Fish \nteleprinters, and had begun using them for their own purposes. \nHowever, initial hopes of a post-war dividend from the breaking \nof these machines were quickly dashed. Roy Jenkins, who was \nthen working at Bletchley Park, recalls this odd interlude in \nMay 1945: \n* When the Russians got to Berlin they took over the Fish \nmachines in the War Ministry, somewhat changed the \nsettings, and proceeded to use them for sending signals \ntraffic to Belgrade and other capitals in their new empire. \nWe continued to do the intercepts and played around with \ntrying to break the messages. We never succeeded. I think \nit was a combination of the new settings being more secure \n(which raises the question of how much the Russians had \nfound out about our previous success) and the edge of \ntension having gone off our effort. \n* Elsewhere, Allied recovery teams regularly overran German \nsigint operations that were still chattering away, producing \ndecrypts of mid-level Soviet Army Group traffic. II \nThe timing of raids on German sigint centres was a precar\u00ad\nious matter. If they were captured too early there was a risk \nthat this would cut off a flow of valuable material that Bletchley \nwas intercepting, or else would alert the Germans to the fact \nthat the British knew more about their cyphers than was desir\u00ad\nable. London was especially anxious to avoid freelance raiding \nactivities that might be counter-productive. As early as May \n1944 the London Signals Intelligence Board, the supreme \ngoverning board which met monthly to set overall British sigint \npolicy, learned that some independently-minded British intelli\u00ad\ngence officers in the Middle East were planning to use the \nSpecial Operations Executive to raid enemy signals intelligence \ncentres in the Balkans. Sir Stewart Menzies, who chaired the \nboard, warned them sternly that operations against such centres \n52 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nwere 'highly undesirable', and that action should 'on no account \nbe undertaken' withOut prior personal authority from him.'12 \nBletchley's corporate takeover of the Axis sigint effort was not \nlimited to Germany. There were even greater TIC OM dividends \nin occupied Italy.13 Many countries competed for the services \nof the talented Italian cryptanalysts. After the Italian surrender \nin 1943, some eighty Italian code-breakers under Major Barbieri \ncontinued to work for the Germans at a station near Brescia in \nnorthern Italy. At the end of the war in Europe they were at \nlast interrogated in Rome, and proved to have a large quantity \nof material, including photocopies of the code books of Turkey, \nRomania, Ecuador and Bolivia. They had also reconstructed \nsome of the code books from France, Switzerland and the Vatican, \nand had smaller amounts of British and American traffic. During \nthe spring of 1945 Barbieri's unit had been concentrating on \nFrench diplomatic traffic, 'a large number being messages to \nParis either from Bonnet [French Ambassador] in New York or \nfrom Catroux [French Ambassador] in Moscow'. This traffic \noffered insights into subjects as diverse as Soviet-Yugoslav rela\u00ad\ntions, Soviet policy in Germany, French economic negotiations \nwith the United States and French plans for exploiting the Saar \ncoal mines in Germany. 14 \nWith British encouragement, this precocious Italian unit \nworked on into the post-war period, without deviating from its \nFrench target. The diplomatic unit at Berkeley Street was already \ndoing extensive work on Britain's European allies, regarding \nthem as either insecure or untrustworthy, or both. Much of this \nsuspicion stemmed from a sense of indignation at their behav\u00ad\niour in 1940. In November 1944, Churchill wrote to Eden: 'The \nBelgians are extremely weak, and their behaviour before the \nwar was shocking. The Dutch were entirely selfish and fought \nonly when attacked, and then for a few hours .. .' General de \nGaulle's Free French government in exile, as other historians \nhave shown, came in for especially close attention from the \ncode-breakers during the war, and this continued into 1946. \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 53 \nDuring the important diplomatic conferences that marked the \nend of the war, Jimmy Byrnes, the new American Secretary of \nState, was apparently more eager to see decrypted French mate\u00ad\nrial than anything else, concerned that Paris was likely to be \nworking with Moscow.ls French traffic from Moscow was of \ngreat interest to London because the former French Air Minister, \nPierre Cot, had indeed begun a special diplomatic mission to \nMoscow to examine the possibility of cooperating against \nGermany in post-war Europe.16 \nFrench traffic provided the British and Americans with a fabu\u00ad\nlous window on the diplomacy of Western Europe.17 Indeed, in \nmid-1946 half the US Army code-breakers' end product was \nbased on intercepting French communications.18 Alarmingly, the \nFrench still seemed keen to develop a close relationship with \nStalin.19 The traffic from French Embassies in Eastern Europe \nproved especially interesting. Typically, an intercept from the \nFrench Embassy in Tirana gave detailed information on the \nbalance of power in the Albanian Cabinet and the waning power \nof the pro-Moscow elements, and intercepted French intelli\u00ad\ngence traffic sometimes offered information about the KGB.20 \nWith the work on Soviet codes still gaining momentum, the \nchatter of other countries that were talking to Moscow provided \ninsights into their thinking. On 13 August 1945, Edward Travis \nsent Joseph Wenger, the senior American naval code-breaker, \na long missive about cooperation on post-war French and Dutch \nsystems, and explained British plans 'to increase the effort here, \nespecially on French', adding that British plans to focus on Paris \n'are going into effect at an early date'. French, Spanish, \nPortuguese and Latin American traffic was soon consolidated \ninto a single group under Josh Cooper.21 \nMajor Barbieri was proud of the work of his Italian code\u00ad\nbreakers against the French, but he pressed for more staff. So \nmany of the best cryptographers, he complained, had been \ncaptured by the French in North Africa, adding, 'the French \nare now employing them in their own service!' Nevertheless, \nthe British concluded that the Italians were 'doing remarkably \n54 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nwell with the limited reserves at their disposal'.22 By mid-1946 \nthey were giving them new tasks, including Soviet traffic which \ncame from military cypher machines at division level code\u00ad\nnamed 'Taper'. British liaison officers with the Italians were \nworking closely with code-breakers in Britain on the identifi\u00ad\ncation of new Taper groups. Senior Italian sigint officers knew \nthat Taper traffic 'which had been taken with so much depth \nand continuity for the past month' was Soviet in origin, but \nmany of their underlings were in a state of blissful ignorance \nabout what they were collecting and who the ultimate customer \nwas.23 \nThe efforts of TICOM were not exclusively directed towards \nraiding priceless sigint secrets from the Germans, the Italians \nand the Japanese. They were also concerned with protecting \nBritain's own secret communications. Until late 1943, Bletchley \nPark regarded weak security as a problem restricted to Britain's \nallies. But the ability to read German messages had revealed a \nnumber of unexpected security nightmares for the Allies. Ultra \nhad shown Britain's code-breakers that the Germans could read \nmany of the codes of the Allies, such as those of the Soviets \nand the Free French. In Asia, terrible cypher security and serious \nhuman agent penetration ensured that Chinese codes were effec\u00ad\ntively an open book to the Japanese, even though Tokyo's code\u00ad\nbreakers were mediocre. Accordingly, keeping Britain's secrets \nsafe meant keeping them away from many of her allies, whose \ncommunications were being read by friend and foe alike.24 \nBy the autumn of 1943 the security situation looked much \nworse. The Italians had now capitulated, and captured Italian \ncode-breakers revealed their successes against British codes. \nCaptain Edmund Wilson, who helped to look after cypher secu\u00ad\nrity at Bletchley Park, held prolonged 'conversations' with \nCommander Cianchi, head of the Italian Cryptographic Bureau \nin Rome, and his staff during late 1943. Wilson explained that \nhe could hardly call them 'interrogations', since Cianchi had \ngiven all of Italy's secret information so happily and freely. Wilson \nsaid that 'very valuable information' on the breaking of British \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 55 \nnaval cyphers had been obtained, and that Britain was \n'extremely fortunate' to have the cooperation of its former oppo\u00ad\nnents. He pressed his colleagues to be 'very careful indeed in \nthe use they made of the information' from these sources.25 \nThe TICOM raids into Germany later confirmed that British \nnaval cypher security had been espedally weak. B-Dienst, the \nGerman naval sigint service, had been reading British naval codes \nand cyphers easily at the start of the war. In early 1940 this had \nallowed it to read British plans for the Narvik raid in Norway, \ncontributing to Germany's success in repulsing that action. In \n1942, the Dieppe raid had also been given away to the enemy \nbefore it took place due to poor cypher security. Incredibly, the \nGermans had been given a full five days to prepare for this \n'surprise attack'. Allied troops -mostly Canadians -paid for \nthis dearly in the slaughter that followed. B-Dienst achieved the \nheight of its success against Atlantic convoy traffic in 1943, \nallowing alterations of convoy routes to be radioed to U-boat \ncommanders within a few hours.26 \nThe autumn of 1943 saw a long-overdue inquiry into the \nsecurity of British cyphers, carried out by Brigadier Chitty, who \nbegan by visiting Bletchley Park. His findings did not make for \ncomfortable reading. 'It is true,' he reported, 'that of the four\u00ad\nteen sections working at B.P. [Bletchley Park] one is named \nSecurity of Allied Communications. From a total staff of some \nsix thousand, however, the part-time services of only one man \n(Dudley-Smith) plus two or three girls, are spared to equip this \nsection.' At a higher level there was a supervising body called \nthe Cypher Security Committee, supposedly chaired by Sir \nStewart Menzies, but this had not attracted Menzies' interest. \nMoreover, it lacked the power to compel Whitehall departments \nto change any practices that they thought lax. Chitty had done \na spot check of twelve departments around Whitehall, and found \nthat few were taking cypher security seriously. Britain needed \na decent operational security section at Bletchley Park, and a \nproper supervisory board with teethY \nNo cypher system, Chitty warned, was unbreakable. Britain's \n56 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nmost sensitive material was sent by one-time pads, which were, \nin his opinion, 'unassailable' if used correctly. Yet he reminded \nhis superiors that Bletchley was making a 'most successful daily \nattack' on the one-time pads of other countries, 'which reach \nus in a steady stream by Photography, Theft, and the sifting of \nEmbassy waste-paper baskets'. The majority of London govern\u00ad\nment traffic went by Typex machine, the British equivalent of \nEnigma. This was much better than Enigma, but Chitty asserted \nthat its security had never really been tested. Again, much \ndepended on the diligence of the operators: \n* One of the most instructive lessons I learnt from the \n[Government Code and Cypher] School was the fact that \nthe Hagelin machine used by several nations including the \nAmericans, affords in practice a widely different degree of \nsecurity in different hands. Whereas this machine, as used \nby the Swedes and the Finns, has so far been virtually \nunbreakable, in the hands of the Italians who are normally \nvery good cryptographers, we have for a long time been \nable to read it with ease. This was entirely due to the \nincreasing idleness of the Italian operators and their \npersistent disregard of the numerous security rules which \nhave been laid down for them. \n* For routine traffic the Foreign Office used more elderly hand \ncyphers, and the services made use of field cyphers in their \nlower formations. Quite rightly, these were thought to be even \nless secure.28 \nBy March 1944, no less a figure than Winston Churchill \nhimself was calling for a shake-up. A new supervisory outfit \nwas created, called the Cypher Policy Board. Although Menzies \nwas in the chair, Edward Travis from GC&CS, together with the \nSecretary of the War Cabinet and a representative of the Chiefs \nof Staff were also there to keep a stern eye on him. This top\u00ad\nlevel representation underlined a deep anxiety about cypher \nsecurity. A new Deputy Director of GC&CS, known as the \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 57 \nCommunications Security Adviser, was also to be appointed, \nwho would serve as the Secretary of the Cypher Policy Board. \nIn reality, this person, Captain Edmund Wilson, was the new \nbroom.29 After the war Wilson was replaced by Commander \nT.R.W. Burton-Miller, who operated from a new headquarters \nat 10 Chesterfield Street Wl, conveniently close to both MIS \nand SIS.3o Soon they had extended their authority over the \ndesign and production of all British cypher machines, with \nGordon Welchman their chief technical adviser.31 \nDuring 1944, Bletchley Park offered an impressive technical \nsolution to worries about cypher security. It fielded a new and \nrather superior cypher machine called 'Rockex l' that produced \nwhat was effectively automated one-time pad traffic. Instead of \nusing tiresome tear-off sheets from a one-time pad that had to \nbe processed by hand, it used code tape, which carried the same \ninformation. This was initially used for messages between \nBletchley Park and its sigint collaborators in Washington and \nOttawa, together with the SIS wartime office in New York. A \nnew version called 'Rockex II' was already being developed by \nthe British. The machine was originally intended for the Special \nCommunications Units that disseminated Ultra to Allied \ncommanders in the field, but after the war it became a main\u00ad\nstream British cypher machine, and was still being used by \nsmaller embassies in the 1970s.32 \nThe super-secret Rockex cypher machine also had another \npurpose. From 1944, it provided extra security for the commu\u00ad\nnications network of Britain's SIS agents around the world. With \nassistance from Bletchley Park, wartime SIS had been able to \ndevelop an effective long-range wireless network to support its \noverseas stations and agents in the field. Known as SIS Section \nVIII, this was run by Brigadier Richard Gambier-Parry from two \ncountry houses not far from Bletchley, at Whaddon Hall and \nHanslope Park. These locations not only provided a wireless \nnetwork for SIS, they also built covert radio sets hidden in suit\u00ad\ncases used by British agents and fitted out vehicles for the Special \nLiaison Units that supplied sigint to overseas commands such \n58 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nas Montgomery's Eighth Army. In addition, Hanslope Park had \nprovided a base for a unit called the Radio Security Service, \nunder Ted Maltby, that had used mobile detection vans to track \nthe radio transmissions of enemy agents hiding in wartime \nBritain. SIS was a small organisation with small volumes of \nradio traffic, and up until 1944 it had been comfortable sending \nits traffic by slow but highly secure one-time pads. The Rockex \nmachine allowed it to take a leap forward.33 \nBy 1944, SIS's Section VIII had expanded considerably and \nwas taking on new customers. With its new Rockex machines, \nit was carrying sume traffic for Bletchley Park, typically from \nCanada, together with secret messages for the Special Operations \nExecutive which conducted sabotage. The Foreign Office was \nnow looking at this efficient radio network with growing interest, \nand at the end of the war SIS Section VIII was simply coopted \nto form the backbone of a new Foreign Office communications \nsystem called the Diplomatic Wireless Service. Gambier-Parry \nbecame the first Foreign Office Director of Communications. As \nearly as 1943 some embassies, such as that in Cairo, had been \nswitching over to 'experimental use of official wireless' by \nmaking use of local SIS facilities.34 Although diplomatic wire\u00ad\nless was technically banned by international diplomatic conven\u00ad\ntion, in practice cable communications had frequently been \ndisrupted during the war, and wireless had crept into wide\u00ad\nspread use as an alternative.35 \nThe gradual development of the Diplomatic Wireless Service \nat Hanslope Park during 1944 and 1945 was another critical \nbuilding block in the creation of the modern British sigint \ncommunity. Alongside the military sigint collection stations in \nlocations such as Ceylon, the Diplomatic Wireless Service, or \n'DWS', doubled as a secret monitoring service working from \nwithin British Embassies and High Commissions. The first perma\u00ad\nnent undercover sigint station was set up at Ankara in 1943. \nDWS staff numbered close to a thousand, and about half its \ntime was devoted to secret collection on behalf of the British \ncode-breakers. Over the years it produced important results from \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 59 \nlocations as far afield as Moscow and Luanda because of its \nability to collect short-range transmissions. \nIn August 1945 the Second World War finally drew to a close. \nWinston Churchill was of the view that Bletchley Park was the \ndeciding factor in the defeat of the Fascist powers: in 1945 he \napparently told King George VI that Ultra had effectively won \nthe war.36 Robert Harris, author of the novel Enigma (1995), \nrightly points out that most of the major combatants had mili\u00ad\ntary forces that were superior to those of Britain, not least in \ntheir weapons technology. Bletchley Park was the one place \nwhere we enjoyed a crucial world lead.37 Harry Hinsley, a junior \nfigure at Bletchley Park, but later the official historian who \nproduced a magisterial study of intelligence during the Second \nWorld War, has famously asserted that Ultra shortened the war \nby several years, saving countless lives on all sides. Without \nUltra, he states, 'Overlord would have had to be delayed until \n1946'.38 Andreas Hillgruber, the distinguished German historian \nof Hitler's strategy agrees, adding that as a result the Soviets \nmight well have aduanced much further west.39 \nYet others, including the British historian Paul Kennedy, have \nargued that the Second World War was largely a battle of mat\u00ad\nerial production, and that once America and Russia were both \npitted against the Axis, their industrial might made the outcome \nonly a matter of time -epitomised by the use of the atomic \nbomb in August 1945. In reality, the debate about the overall \nvalue of Bletchley Park has a troubling 'What if?' quality. \nInevitably, we are encouraged to ponder the alternative universe \nof 'no Ultra'. Ralph Bennett, like Harry Hinsley a Bletchley Park \nveteran turned historian, has expressed impatience with such \ncounter-factual speculations, regarding them as a parlour game. \nHe has argued that the absence of Ultra would have forced the \nfaster development of other forms of intelligence, such as aerial \nreconnaissance.4o Peter Calvocoressi, another distinguished \nhistorian who spent the war at Bletchley Park, has dismissed \nHinsley's assertions as 'silly' .41 \n60 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nSome propositions can however be advanced with confidence. \nUltra and other kinds of sigint contributed hugely to the outcome \nof the Battle of Britain. The breaking of naval Enigma changed \nthe course of the Battl~ of the Atlantic, allowing the Admiralty \nto direct convoys away from concentrations of U-boats and \nbringing the level of ship losses down to a bearable, although \nstill frightening, level. This in turn allowed a breathing space \nfor more successful anti-submarine warfare techniques to be \ndeveloped which would finally turn the tide in the battle against \nthe U-boat in 1943. Ultra also contributed greatly to the British \nnaval victories at the Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941) and \nthe Battle of North Cape (December 1943). Parallel code\u00ad\nbreaking work by the Americans in the Pacific allowed the \ndramatic interception of the aircraft carrying the brilliant Admiral \nYamamoto, architect of Pearl Harbor, which sounded the death \nknell for Japanese naval forces in the Pacific. It is impossible to \nunderstand the war at sea without comprehending the contri\u00ad\nbution of Ultra in the west and the breaking of a range of \nJapanese cypher systems in the east. Appropriately, it fell to a \nnaval officer, Commander Edward Travis, to pilot Bletchley Park \nas it sailed forward into the post-war era. \nEven in the spring of 1945, final victory in Europe had loomed \nlike the end of an interminable school year -with the distant \nsummer holidays already beckoning. Bletchley Park, with its \nnearby dormitories and improvised tennis courts, had looked \nrather like a vast boarding school waiting for the end of term. \nPost-war worries were not troubling many of the brilliant minds \nthere. Instead, for the most part they were yearning for an end \nto war and a return to peacetime activities. The majority of \nBletchley's wartime residents were exhausted from years of \ngruelling hard work. The intellectual pressure had been enor\u00ad\nmous, and some had suffered nervous breakdowns: Jean \nThompson, a Wren who worked at one of the outstations, recalls \nthat they routinely referred to Bletchley Park as the 'Nut \nHouse'.42 Most code-breakers greeted the end of the war with \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 61 \nrelief, returning to their former activities in ivy-covered colleges, \nlibraries and museums. However, a minority had been bitten \nby the intelligence bug. They understood the fundamental impor\u00ad\ntance of what they had been doing for the future of interna\u00ad\ntional affairs, and would stay on. \nThose who remained at Bletchley Park were also thinking of \n'escape' -but in a different sense. For them, the end of the war \ndid not so much offer an opportunity of personal freedom, but \nmore the possibility of liberation for the GC&CS. Their remark\u00ad\nable achievements over the last five years suggested that GC&CS \nmight cease to exist under the cloying direction of Britain's \ntraditional overseas secret service, SIS, where the senior staff \nwere often failed cavalry officers recruited in White's or Boodle's. \nInstead, GC&CS might hope to become an intelligence agency \nin its own right, perhaps one of a new and different kind. Indeed, \nits rising status was already signalled by a gradual change in \neveryday usage from terms like 'GC&CS' and 'BP' to the rather \ngrander cover name of 'Government Communications \nHeadquarters', or 'GCHQ', which had been in intermittent use \nsince early 1940Y \nBletchley Park had already taken some important strides \ntowards becoming a fully-fledged intelligence service. Peter \nCalvocoressi, one of its distinguished wartime denizens, recalls \nthat in its pre-war incarnation the Government Code and Cypher \nSchool was exactly what its name implied, 'and no more'. It \nmade up codes for use by the British government, and broke \nthe codes of other nations. But at Bletchley Park, and especially \nunder Gordon Welchman in Hut Six, code-breaking was grad\u00ad\nually married to an intelligence process to provide a sophisti\u00ad\ncated system for sigint exploitation. No less importantly, \nBletchley also designed a means for the secure and rapid distri\u00ad\nbution of sigint to essential customers, even in distant theatres \nsuch as South-East Asia. The sheer pressure of wartime exigency \nforced rapid and logical developments that might otherwise have \ntaken decades.44 \nAnother massive achievement was that Bletchley Park and \n62 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nits diplomatic equivalent at Berkeley Street in London were \nproperly 'integrated', mixing up staff from the three armed serv\u00ad\nices and civilians. This was immediately obvious to any visitor \nfrom the curious bknd of uniform and civilian dress, often in \nexotic combinations. Occasionally a visiting Admiral or General \nwould fulminate to see members of his service dressed in \ncolourful pullovers, and demand that they return to full uniform. \nHowever, the top brass on day trips from Whitehall were little \nmore than a temporary nuisance. During the 1940s a sigint \nservice which mixed up civilians and personnel from the armed \nservices was quite remarkable. It would take the Americans \nuntil the early 1950s to achieve an integrated organisation that \nmirrored Bletchley. In Nazi Germany as Calvocoressi recalls, the \nsituation had been even worse, for there 'six or seven different \ncryptographic establishments fought each other almost as \nvenomously as they fought the enemy' .45 \nIn the social anthropology of intelligence, sigint was emerging \nas the dominant tribe. 'The Ultra community at BP saw itself \nas -perhaps was --an elite within an elite: recalled one code\u00ad\nbreaker. Material gathered by other kinds of intelligence agen\u00ad\ncies was merely 'Top Secret', but sigint material was \ncompartmentalised as 'Top Secret-Ultra'. The ability to impose \ndraconian security on its product would be a hallmark of a fully\u00ad\nfledged sigint organisation, and dominated its relations with its \nfriends and allies in the code-breaking world. This security obses\u00ad\nsion also extended to people. The security rule at Bletchley Park \nwas 'Once in, never out.' In other words, once people had \nworked in sigint, there was a reluctance to allow them to move \nto other areas of war work, and they were effectively 'captive' \nfor the duration of the war. \nDominance was partly about size. By the end of the war, over \nten thousand people were labouring under Bletchley's direc\u00ad\ntion. The expanded bombe effort alone led to the creation of \nfive further outstations as far away as Stanmore and Eastcote \non the outskirts of London. Working alongside GC&CS were \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 63 \nthe listening units of the armed forces, known as the Y serv\u00ad\nices. Although these fed high-grade material to Bletchley Park, \nthey also worked on low-grade material for their own purposes. \nOften considered 'poor relations', they derived their intelligence \neither from listening in to low-level tactical communications \nthat were not encrypted, including clear voice traffic, or by \nsimply analysing the flow of traffic. Analysing the patterns of \nradio traffic, including volume and direction, even without \nbreaking the codes, could reveal a great deal of information \nabout the enemy, and GC&CS worked closely with the armed \nservices to develop what were known as the 'Y stations'. Bill \nMillward, who continued to serve long after the war, recalls \nthat Bletchley Park's relationship to the Y services was to become \n'a sort of university of signals intelligence, developing tech\u00ad\nniques which all might share' .46 The Y services had been largely \nresponsible for deducing the enemy 'order of battle', the struc\u00ad\nture, strength and location of the units of the German armed \nforces. The Navy ran intercept sites at Scarborough and \nWinchester. The Army ran a site at Fort Bridgelands near \nChatham, and later opened a station at Beaumanor Hall near \nLoughborough in Leicestershire. The RAF were located at \nCheadle in Cheshire, and developed a large new site at \nChicksands near Baldock in Bedfordshire. Many of these loca\u00ad\ntions would continue as sigint sites after August 1945.47 All of \nthem were symptomatic of an industrial revolution in secret \nintelligence: both Bletchley Park and the outstations operated \nlike factories, with three gruelling shifts each day. \nAt a deeper leveL there had also been a social revolution in \nBritish intelligence. Brilliant individuals who only a year before \nhad been members of international chess teams or wrestling \nwith obscure mathematical problems in Cambridge colleges, \nwere now focused on intelligence. Remorselessly logical, they \ncould see that Bletchley Park was the intelligence machine of \nthe future. Moreover, they were outsiders, with no sense of \nbureaucratic anxiety and no fear of the 'Establishment'. They \nfearlessly articulated what to them was self-evident. GC&CS, \n64 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nonce a small school of code-breakers working in the service of \nSIS, had now vastly outgrown its parent organisation. Gladwyn \nJebb, one of a number of rising British diplomats who were \ntemporarily attached to intelligence duties during the war, \nnoticed this dramatic change. The organisations like Bletchley \nPark had been forced to recruit widely from industry and the \nuniversities to fill their ranks, so they had forward-looking staff \nwho brought with them modern organisational techniques.48 \nJebb complained that SIS had 'too much of what I would call \nthe \"false beard\" mentality ... more especially amongst those \nwho have been in the show for a very long time'. The world \nhad moved on, he argued: 'The idea of a deeply mysterious \n\"Master Spy\", sitting in some unknown office and directing an \narmy of anonymous agents, is as outdated as it is romantic.'49 \nThe Americans had also opened the eyes of GC&CS to what \nwas technologically possible. Although hobbled by the bitter \nArmy-Navy divide, Washington nevertheless threw vast scien\u00ad\ntific resources at sigint. On their visits across the Atlantic, a core \nof determined individuals from Bletchley were able to glimpse \nwhat the future might hold. In 1944 a small group of talented \nBritish code-breakers began the long-range planning that would \nturn wartime Bletchley Park -with its chess players and cross\u00ad\nword puzzlers -into Britain's premier post-war secret service, \nwith a strong sense of identity, a large budget and predatory \ndesigns on other agencies. Three key figures were instrumental \nin this: Gordon Welchman, the man behind Bletchley Park's \nintelligence processing centre; Harry Hinsley, who would serve \nas the 'sherpa' for the Anglo-American-Commonwealth sigint \nsummits after 1945; and Edward Crankshaw, who had handled \nwartime sigint discussions with the Soviets. Hugh Foss joined \nthem on his return from a posting in Washington. 50 \nOn 15 September 1944, only weeks after the liberation of \nParis, this planning group began to consider GC&CS's post-war \nfuture. It was led by Gordon Welchman, who was Assistant \nDirector for Mechanisation, and had also been responsible for \nHut Six, where Enigma was broken. Some of the exciting ideas \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 65 \nthe group advanced for the future of GC&CS grew largely out \nof the Hut Six experience. It called for a more centralised 'Foreign \nIntelligence Office' as part of a coherent national intelligence \norganisation, and for a comprehensive body dealing with all \nforms of sigint, together with a modern signals security organ\u00ad\nisation with the latest communications engineering. This, the \ngroup believed, could become a truly modern 'Intelligence \nCentre' governing all types of interception activities.51 \nWelchman's group was tough-minded. There were, it argued, \nfew people in GC&CS with real ability in general planning and \nstrategic coordination. They observed, 'it would be difficult to \ncount as many as a dozen'. This talent should not be wasted \non the final year of the war against Japan. Instead, as soon as \nthe war in Europe was over, 'as many as possible of the few \npotential planners should be set to work in the direction of our \nthree immediate objectives, instead of devoting more of their \ntime to Japanese problems'. GC&CS should not lose touch with \ndevelopments in the field of Japanese sigint problems, since \nthere were interesting things to learn in this sphere. However, \nit should merely extract technical benefits from the Japanese \nWar, rather than expend resources upon it. British commanders \nin Burma, like Field Marshal Bill Slim, realised that they were \nnow a low priority for the intelligence services, and complained \nbitterly about it. 52 \nGC&CS realised that speed was of the essence. It was 'imper\u00ad\native to make an approach to the present Prime Minister at the \nearliest possible moment'. Any successor to Churchill, it \nreasoned, however sympathetic, could not have a real appreci\u00ad\nation of 'the fruits of intelligence in this war', or Churchill's \nkeen appreciation of the importance of tight security. In Churchill \nit had a heavyweight advocate, and it feared a return to the \npre-war situation of under-recognition of what sigint could \nachieve; even now, the true scale of its wartime output was \nknown to only a very few in high places. Moreover, the really \ntalented sigint planners were newcomers, and would soon be \nrecalled to their pre-war occupations unless some positive action \n66 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nwas taken to retain them. Quite simply, this came down to cash. \nGC&CS had to have the status to secure 'a sufficiently liberal \nsupply of money to enable it to attract men of first rate ability', \nparticularly engineers and electronics experts. It was also aware \nthat it would have to give equal weight to all types of intelli\u00ad\ngence about foreign countries, 'including scientific, commercial \nand economic matters'. This was a tacit reference to the targeting \nof friendly states.53 \nIn January 1945, the torch of post-war planning passed to \nWilliam F. Clarke. Clarke, who had served continuously in code\u00ad\nbreaking from 1916, warned that the 'enormous power wielded \nby the Treasury' might soon be brought to bear on GC&CS. As \nhad happened in 1919, work on military cyphers might cease \nin favour of concentration on diplomatic material only. This, he \ninsisted, could be 'disastrous', because the resulting damage to \nongoing cryptographic research might mean that in the event \nof a sudden future conflict, enemy military traffic would prove \ninaccessible. Even more problematic was the challenge of \nbuilding up the prestige of GC&CS. Its very secrecy was its worst \nenemy, ensuring that many in elevated government circles did \nnot know its true value. There was also the 'potential danger' \nof a Labour government coming to power, since the interwar \nLabour government had found many aspects of the secret state \nto be repellent. \nClarke also paused to consider the emerging United Nations. \nAllowing himself some momentary Utopian thoughts, he \nobserved that if the new organisation took the step of abol\u00ad\nishing all code and cypher communications, this action 'would \ncontribute more to a permanent peace than any other'. However, \nhe conceded that this 'is probably the counsel of perfection', \nand was highly improbable. Instead, he predicted that energetic \ncode-making and code-breaking would persist into the post-war \nworld. On the matter of who would control the British code\u00ad\nbreakers, he felt that in the past neither the Admiralty nor the \nForeign Office had been satisfactory. The current system of \ncontrol by SIS also brought with it 'certain disadvantages'. Clarke \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 67 \nvigorously asserted that GC&CS should break free, not only of \nSIS but also of the Foreign Office. Instead it should be a separ\u00ad\nate organisation under either the Chiefs of Staff or the Cabinet \nOffice, and should be regarded as a wholly separate third secret \nservice. 54 \nAs late as October 1944, some senior figures at Bletchley \nwere still arguing for reabsorption by SIS. John Tiltman, the \nSoviet specialist, argued that the code-breakers should be \n'closely fused with S.LS. under the Director General [Sir Stewart \nMenzies] as the one and only Intelligence producing service'.55 \nHowever, the stock of Menzies was continuing to fall among \nsenior figures in Whitehall. In January 1945, the Chairman of \nthe JIC, Victor Cavendish Bentinck, concocted his own influ\u00ad\nential vision of 'the intelligence machine'. He suggested that \nGC&CS should remain under the overall direction of 'e', but \nat the same time it would be a separate organisation and 'not \na part of SIS'. It would boast its own budget alongside the other \nsecret services as part of the Secret Vote, Britain's quaintly titled \nintelligence budget.56 It was thus Commander Edward Travis, \nnot Menzies, who determined the final shape of GC&CS shortly \nafter VJ-Day. Although peace had arrived, Travis's mind was \nalready focused on possible future conflict with the Soviets. \nRecalling the earliest days of the last war, he observed, 'When \ninformation was most urgently required, very little was forth\u00ad\ncoming.' The next war was likely to be of shorter duration, \nwith little time for mobilisation. In such a conflict the British \nwould have to fight with what they had. It was essential that \ncontinuity be maintained, and that rapid expansion was possible \non the eve of war. \nExactly when the post-war term 'GCHQ' came into common \nusage is a matter of dispute. It was first used as a cover name \nto confuse workmen dropping off furniture at the Bletchley \nPark site as early as the end of 1939.57 By 1946, although tech\u00ad\nnically still merely a cover name, it was used more and more \nwidely to denote Britain's code-breakers. Travis decided that the \nnew post-war GCHQ would be divided into five groups run by \n68 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nhis key subordinates. 58 To cover its multifarious tasks, he hoped \nto have a thousand civilians plus a hundred military staff at a \nnew sigint centre located somewhere near to the policy-makers \nin London. By contrast, the outlying Y stations would be manned \nby about five thousand additional personnel, of whom only a \nfew would be civilians. GCHQ's own core staff fell rapidly from \nan end-of-war strength of 8,902 to a projected 1,010 for 1946.59 \nDespite the dramatic drop in numbers, Travis concluded that \nthe post-war deal he had struck with the Treasury was 'on the \nwhole most satisfactory'. For him it was about quality rather \nthan quantity. A few days before Christmas 1945 he explained: \n'The war proved beyond doubt that the more difficult aspects \nof our work call for staff of the highest calibre, the successes \nby the Professors and Dons among our temporary staff, espe\u00ad\ncially perhaps the high grade mathematicians, put that beyond \ndoubt: He wanted suitable conditions with which to attract \nthese sorts of people, although he knew this would be diffi\u00ad\ncult.60 Captain Edmund Wilson, Travis's Principal Establishment \nOfficer, echoed this view, arguing that of the 260 officers to be \nkept on in their post-war establishment, some two hundred of \nthem must have not only initiative but also 'first class brains' .61 \nWhere would GCHQ's new centre be? What it craved was a \nsite in central London, next to the policy-makers, but even with \nthe post-war demobilisation of many government departments, \nnothing suitable could be found. The solution was what John \nBetjeman would immortalise as 'Metroland'. GCHQ moved to \nthe outer fringes of north-west London, close to Harrow and \nPinner. The precise location was Eastcote, which had been used \nas a wartime outstation of Bletchley Park. It was also close to \nDollis Hill, where the laboratories of the Post Office Research \nDepartment had built the remarkable 'Colossus' computer. \nTogether with Stanmore, Eastcote was one of two large out\u00ad\nstations built in 1943 to accommodate the ever-expanding number \nof bombes that were being used to cope with the flood of Enigma \ntraffic. However, while it provided reasonable single-storey build\u00ad\nings that were superior to the huts of Bletchley, the overall site \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 69 \nwas regarded as cramped and unattractive. In June 1946, William \nBodsworth, a British code-breaker, returned from a period in \nAmerica to the cold and rain of an English summer to take over \nGCHQ's Soviet section. He found his first sight of Eastcote 'frankly \nshattering'. Expecting 'a nice old country house', instead he found \nit to be 'more cheerless than any of the temporary buildings I \nhave seen in this racket either here or abroad'.62 \nThose who were leaving Bletchley for good and returning to \ncivilian occupations were given the security warning of their \nlives. Edward Travis issued a 'Special Order' to everyone in \nGCHQ. He began by thanking them all for their admirable \nachievements and the substantial contribution they had made \nto the winning of the war. He then moved quickly on to the \nmatter of maintaining secrecy, even after the end of hostilities. \n'At some future time we may be called upon again to use the \nsame methods. It is therefore as vital as ever not to relax from \nthe high standards of security that we have hitherto maintained. \nThe temptation to \"own up\" to our friends and families as to \nwhat our war work has been is a very real and natural one. It \nmust be resisted absolutely:63 However, in the Far East, the \nsecret of 'Magic', the breaking of Japanese diplomatic codes, \nwas already out. When Bruce Keith, commander of the vast \nBritish sigint station located at HMS Anderson in Ceylon, tried \nto outline Travis's tight security measures, some of his subor\u00ad\ndinates openly laughed at him and observed that 'the Americans \nhad spilled the beans in the paper the other day'. 64 \nThe move from Bletchley to Eastcote was undertaken during \nearly 1946 in four main parties. The first was the priority group, \nand included the Soviet and East European Division; the last \narrived in April 1946.65 Staff turning up in leafy Pinner in search \nof lodgings were allowed to refer to their place of work as \n'GCHQ', but they were told firmly that any reference to 'signals \nintelligence' was forbidden.66 Between 1945 and 1948 the term \n'GCHQ' was used interchangeably with both 'London Signals \nIntelligence Centre' and 'Station X'.67 \nBletchley Park was now an empty shell in the Bedfordshire \n70 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \ncountryside. Barbara Abernethy, who had worked as Denniston's \npersonal assistant, rec.alls: 'We just closed down the huts, put \nall the files away and sent them down to Eastcote. I was the \nlast person left at Bletchley Park. I locked the gate and took the \nkey down to Eastcote. That was it:68 Much of the machinery \nwas broken up, including examples of the mighty 'Colossus' \ncomputational machine. However, Professor Max Newman, who \nhad been central to its development, managed to secure two \n'Colossus' machines for his new computing department at \nManchester University. These were transported by the Ministry \nof War Transport at the price of thirty-four shillings a ton. \nNewman offered to send a junior university lecturer down 'to \nsit on the van' to make sure that the precious machines were \nnot damaged in transit.69 In fact, this was not quite the end of \nBletchley Park's active life in sigint, since GCHQ continued to \nuse it for training courses as late as the 1960s. \nThe intention behind GCHQ's post-war move to London was \nto service the centres of power in British government. \nAccordingly, in the autumn of 1945 Travis took the opportu\u00ad\nnity to look at how the sigint product -the 'blue jackets' or \n'BJs'-circulated around Whitehall. The Foreign Office was a \nbig customer, receiving three sets of BJs daily. One set stayed \nwith Ernest Bevin, the new Foreign Secretary and his war\u00ad\nweary Permanent Under-Secretary, Cadogan, 'for their imme\u00ad\ndiate information'. Another went to the Services Liaison \nDepartment, which worked closely with the JIe. The third went \nto the main departments. Virtually everyone in the operational \ncore of the Foreign Office habitually saw BJs, but they were \nalways kept separate from other documents in special boxes \nwhich were locked up overnight.70 \nIn MI5, the ritual of sigint security was closely observed. \nDistribution was presided over by the redoubtable 'Mrs \nArbuthnot', who recorded everything meticulously in her log. \nSecurity of BJs seems to have been at its most lax inside SIS, \nwhere batches of them circulated around sections for as long \nas six weeks before being returned. Nor were they properly \nEVERY WAR MUST HAVE AN END 71 \nlogged. GCHQ noted that, quite uniquely, inside SIS BJs were \nnever treated as requiring special security measures, and indeed \nin some cases had 'found their way into the General Office for \nfiling'. This broke the cardinal rule that sigint was never to mix \nwith ordinary paperwork.71 \nThe first major international crisis of the Cold War era was not \nlong in coming. In June 1948, the Soviets decided to block road \nand railway access to the western sectors of Berlin, which were \ncontrolled by the British, the French and the Americans. The \nBerlin Blockade was defeated by a massive airlift of some four \nthousand tons of supplies a day. Hidden amongst the innum\u00ad\nerable supply flights heading to Berlin were anonymous but \nhighly secret aircraft collecting sigint for GCHQ, which provided \nsome of the best intelligence during the crisis. Even before the \ncrisis ended in May 1949, GCHQ had already been working \nhard on the 'Russian problem' for almost five years. The early \nonset of the Cold War had not only provided GCHQ with new \ntargets, but had helped to perpetuate the wartime alliance \nbetween British code-breakers and their counterparts in allied \ncountries. This, as we shall see, was fundamental to the post\u00ad\nwar success of GCHQ. \n4 \nThe I(G B and the Venona Project \n... Paul [Guy Burgess], and Yan [Anthony Blunt] consider that \nthe situation is serious. \nMessage from the KGB station in London to Moscow, \nFebruary 19501 \nThe 'Venona Project' was possibly the most astounding code\u00ad\nbreaking effort of the early Cold War.2 Employing perhaps no \nmore than a hundred people, it exploited a weakness in KGB \ncommunications and decoded some of the messages sent by Soviet \nintelligence. As a result, it revealed key Soviet agents and illumi\u00ad\nnated the unexpectedly vast scope and scale of KGB espionage in \nthe West during the 1940s. This material was so significant that \neven though no new messages were collected after 1948, British \nand American code-breakers continued to work on the residue \nuntil October 1980. Initiated by the Americans, Venona collected \nnew partners -first the British, and later the Australians, the \nCanadians, the Dutch and even the 'neutral' Swedes. It is justly \nfamous for revealing some of the 'giants' of Russian espionage, \nincluding Klaus Fuchs and Donald Maclean, but the vast pool of \nmessages that remain unsolved is also significant. Even now, it \npoints unambiguously to many other cases yet to be resolved. \nAnxiety about the compromise of sigint secrets was always \ncentral to the code-breaking profession. Back in 1927, Prime \nMinister Stanley Baldwin's infamous exposure of the reading of \nSoviet high-grade systems in the House of Commons had taught \na whole generation of interwar code-breakers the price of care\u00ad\nless talk. Thereafter, anxiety about the Ultra secret persuaded more \nthan ten thousand people to keep their wartime vow of silence \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 73 \nfor decades. However, Venona introduced an even greater level \nof paranoia, since it hinted at the possibility of hundreds of Soviet \nagents active inside the governments of the West, some in high \npositions. For this reason it is unlikely that Venona was ever made \nknown to President Roosevelt, and it was three years before his \nsuccessor, Harry Truman, was let into the secret. Clement Attlee, \nBritain's first post-war leader, was not told until a major security \ncase made it unavoidable in late 1947.3 Nevertheless, the Venona \nproject was compromised by several Soviet agents within five \nyears of its initiation. This did not entirely negate its value, since \nthe Soviets could not prevent the West from continuing work on \nthe immense volume of KGB messages that had already been \ncollected during the 1 940s, patiently revealing the names of impor\u00ad\ntant agents. In the late 1950s, for example, GCHQ suddenly began \nto have success with Soviet Naval Intelligence messages, having \nused a new analytic technique.4 \nThe extreme secrecy of the Venona project was its Achilles \nheel. Although the material often pointed to the identity of \nSoviet spies in the West, for security reasons it could not be \nshown to those arrested to persuade them to confess; still less \ncould it be produced in court. Any sensible defence lawyer \nwould seek to probe the nature of Venona, not only exposing \nits fragmentary nature, but also revealing sensitive secrets about \nsigint. Therefore, once spies had been identified by Venona, they \nhad to be either caught red-handed meeting with their KGB \ncontroller, or successfully interrogated and broken. The result \nwas a game of cat and mouse in which the mouse sometimes \ngot away. In 1951, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and John \nCairncross were among those who escaped by a whisker. \nRemarkably, Theodore Hall, an American Communist spy within \nthe atomic programme, also brassed it out, despite close inter\u00ad\nrogation, escaping what would almost certainly have been death \nin the electric chair.5 By contrast, in 1950 the atom spy Klaus \nFuchs succumbed to repeated and patient questioning by MI5 \nafter his arrest. He told his interrogators that he 'supposed he \nwould be shot', and was pleasantly surprised when he wasn't.6 \n74 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nVenona revealed the security-minded nature of the Soviets. \nMuch of their traffic was encrypted using a one-time pad system. \nThis was time-consuming and slow, but they were willing to put \nin vast effort to protect their communications. This required huge \nvolumes of tear-off pads with sheet after sheet of random \nnumbers. The difficulty of generating thousands of sheets of truly \nrandom numbers should not be underestimated, and no one is \nclear how the Soviets made them. One individual has recalled \na room full of women simply shouting out any number that \ncame into their heads, but this seems improbable. Others have \ndescribed devices not unlike lottery machines, with numbered \nballs. Whatever system was used, the logistical difficulties of \ngenerating many thousands of one-time pads and distributing \nthem proved too much for wartime Russia.7 Some time in early \n1942, with Moscow on the verge of evacuation and much of \nSoviet industry badly dislocated, operators began to run out of \npads. The KGB department that printed them committed the \nfatal error of reprinting twenty-five thousand pages. This made \na small proportion of the messages, which should have been \nunbreakable, vulnef3.ble to cryptanalysis. Far worse, they were \nsent to KGB units as well as to military and diplomatic users.8 \nThe Venona project that exploited this mistake began in \nWashington. The Americans had collected Soviet messages during \nthe war, but they lacked time to work on them. On 1 February \n1943 the US Army's code-breaking service, called the Signals \nIntelligence Service, began a modest effort to see if it could \nexploit Soviet diplomatic communications. The telegrams had \nbeen collected at Arlington Hall, in Virginia, a former girls' school \nwhich was commandeered by the Army as its main code-breaking \ncentre. Interest increased dramatically when it was discovered \nthat some of the streams of traffic related to espionage. In October \n1943 a young code-breaker, Lieutenant Richard Hallock, a Signal \nCorps reserve officer who had been a peacetime archaeologist \nat the University of Chicago, was looking at Soviet commercial \ntraffic when he realised that the Soviets had committed a terrible \nerror and were reusing their pads. This was an astonishing \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 75 \ndiscovery, and thereafter Venona slowly began to unravel some \nof the KGB's most precious secrets.9 \nThe US Army's head of signals intelligence, Carter W. Clarke, \nwas the main enthusiast for Venona. Clarke was a tough, impa\u00ad\ntient, hard-drinking individual who many regarded as uncouth, \nbut he was also a lateral thinker. Like many military intelligence \nchiefs in both Britain and the United States, he nurtured a deep\u00ad\nseated distrust of the Soviets, asserting bluntly: 'They're your \nfriends today and they're your enemies tomorrow, and when \nthey're on your side find out as much as you can about them \nbecause you can't when they become your enemy.'10 The US Navy \ncode-breakers also began work on Soviet traffic in the summer \nof 1943. The fact that by the autumn of 1944 the two rival anned \nservices were both referring to all Soviet radio intercepts by the \nsame code name of 'Rattan' suggests a directive from a high level. \nThe following year the code name was changed to 'Bourbon'.11 \nBy 1944, another talented young American code-breaker, \nMeredith Gardner, was busy making the first breaks into KGB \ntraffic and even some from Soviet military intelligence (GRU). \nOther code-breakers were now drafted in to help. One of them \nwas Cecil Phillips, a chemistry student who was sent to Arlington \nHall in June 1943, initially to work on Japanese naval messages. \nIn May 1944 he was switched to Soviet diplomatic traffic. He \nquickly realised the scale of duplication, and made a number \nof progressions that led to wider breaks in the cypher system \nused by the KGB. \nHowever, substantial activity had to await the end of the war \nwith Japan, when larger numbers of staff could be transferred \nto work on 'the Russian problem'. 12 Some of the Soviet messages \nwere double-encrypted, and so represented a fantastic level of \ndifficulty. Nevertheless, on 20 December 1946 Gardner decrypted \na KGB message listing the names of scientists who had been \nworking on the wartime development of the atomic bomb at \nLos Alamos, known as the 'Manhattan Project'. In spring 1947 \nhe decyphered a message that showed that the Soviets were \nbeing given highly classified material from inside the US War \n76 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nDepartment.13 KGB agents were rarely referred to by their real \nnames in the messages. The British spy Donald Maclean, for \nexample, was 'Homer' or 'Gomer'. Accordingly, their identities \nhad to be figured out from their activities and from what mat\u00ad\nerial they were providing to the Soviets.14 \nEarly accounts of Venona suggested that the first breaks were \nachieved as a result of the recovery of a partly burned Soviet \ncodebook found in Finland and sold to America's wartime intel\u00ad\nligence agency, the Office of Strategic Services. Stories have long \ncirculated about how American diplomats insisted that protocol \nrequired that it be returned to the Soviets. In fact, up until \n1952, the progress made on Venona was probably driven by the \npure sweat of mathematics, and represented a remarkable intel\u00ad\nlectual achievement. A little help was gained by intercepting \nJapanese traffic that contained Soviet material purchased from \nthe Finns in 1944. The Finns had not been reading high-grade \ntraffic, but had learned enough to be able to sort messages into \nhomogeneous groups, the first stage of a cryptanalytical attackY \nIt was only in 1953 that the American team realised that one \nof the KGB system~ it was working on related to a Soviet code\u00ad\nbook that had been in their possession since 1945. At the end \nof the war TICOM Team 6, led by Lieutenant Colonel Paul Neff, \nhad seized a copy of a partially burned Soviet codebook while \nexploring the German sigint centre at Burgscheidungen. The \nGermans had themselves seized the codebook from the Soviet \nConsulate in Petsamo in Finland during June 1941.16 \nThe big shock was revelations about espionage within the \nManhattan Project. This immediately raised the question of how \nthe material might be employed for counter-espionage. Liaison was \nestablished with Robert Lamphere of the FBI's Intelligence Division, \nwhich had responsibility for maintaining physical surveillance on \nSoviet espionage activities. Venona was of immense help to the \nFBI, but it was not a one-way street. Occasionally the Bureau \nundertook burglaries of Soviet premises and photographed Soviet \ndocuments. Over the next decade, attempts were made to match \nmaterial from these 'black bag jobs' with Venona material, but \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 77 \nsadly there were few connections. Nevertheless, Lamphere ensured \na coordinated exploitation system with the code-breakersY \nMeredith Gardner recalls that tight security for Venona only \ncrept in slowly. In the beginning, everyone in the branch where \nit was being worked on was potentially privy to it, and 'no \nspecial treatment was given'. This was partly because crypt\u00ad\nanalysts had to support each other by discussing problems, since \nsystems were often related to each other. There were people \nwho genuinely needed to know, and there were also 'mere \nbusy-bodies who perhaps considered themselves consultants at \nlarge for all'. The Army intelligence liaison man, Howard Barkley, \nheard that 'there was something interesting going on' and came \nfor a look, even though he had not been formally indoctrinated. \nKnowledge of Venona 'might have been picked up almost \nanywhere' in the branch at Arlington.ls \nYet Venona was 'so sensational' that eventually something \nunusual had to be done on the security front. The focus was less \non restricting the knowledge that it existed than on tightly control\u00ad\nling the contents of the messages. However, counter-intelligence \nis a messy business. What the US Army code-breakers needed in \norder to identify the spies was background material from other \ngovernment departments -so they were forced to work closely \nwith a gradually expanding circle of people scattered across \nWashington. Typically, seven copies of one Venona message, issued \non 30 August 1947 and entitled 'Cover Names in Diplomatic \nTraffic', were circulated. One went to GCHQ through its liaison, \nColonel Patrick Marr-Johnson. The US Army code-breakers noted \nthat the British surrounded the material with 'rigid safeguards'. \nTVvo copies went to the heads of Army and Navy code-breaking. \nFour went to mainstream Army Intelligence, Naval Intelligence \nand FBI. The State Department was also an important collabo\u00ad\nrator. Given that informal secondary briefing must have taken \nplace, this means that perhaps as many as thirty people may have \nbeen given information from one circulated Venona message.19 \nBy contrast, an understanding on Venona was only reached with \nthe CIA in September 1948, and detailed cooperation on active \n78 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \ncases did not occur until 1952. Remarkably, this was six years \nafter the American code-breakers had fully indoctrinated the \nBritish at GCHQ.20 \nIt was the TICOM raids of early 1945 into Nazi Germany that \nhad forced the British and the Americans to reveal their respec\u00ad\ntive hands on the 'Russian problem'. TICOM was an Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican project, and no one could disguise the fact that material \non German code-breaking successes against the Soviet Union \nwas one of its top priorities. TIC OM led to some of the greatest \nsuccesses of the early Cold War. During the autumn of 1945 \nsome of its best results were coming from a Soviet encyphered \nteleprinter system code-named 'Caviar' which was almost \ncertainly being broken with the help of the German team recov\u00ad\nered by Rushworth and Norland on their foray into Germany. \nNo less important was the breaking of a number of Soviet mili\u00ad\ntary machine cyphers that were not dissimilar to the Enigma \nmachine, or its widely used Swedish equivalent, the 'Hagelin' \nmachine. GCHQ code-named these machines the 'Poets Systems'. \nThe first success was with an encoded Soviet teletype system \ncode-named 'Coleridge' that gave great administrative detail \nrelating to the Red Army in Eastern Europe. Carefully combined \nwith material from more basic techniques such as radio direc\u00ad\ntion-finding, it provided a superbly detailed picture of the Soviet \nArmy in Europe. Thereafter, a team of GCHQ cryptanalysts led \nby Gerry Morgan working with an American naval team helped \nto decrypt another Soviet system called 'Longfellow'. Some of \nthe best successes against Soviet machines were the product of \nthe brilliant mind of Hugh Alexander, combined with the enor\u00ad\nmous computer power provided by GCHQ's American allies. In \nthe Far East, Soviet naval codes were beginning to yield, but \nimmediately after the war, 'Coleridge' and 'Longfellow' were the \nmost important Soviet systems being exploited by the West.21 \nBritain was told about the embryonic Venona project as early \nas August 1945, and thereafter John Tiltman, head of the \nCryptographic Group at Eastcote, was kept informed of progress.22 \nHowever, full cooperation came a little later. The young American \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 79 \ncode-breaker Cecil Phillips spent six months at GCHQ's new loca\u00ad\ntion at Eastcote collaborating with Philip Howse. They focused \non Soviet traffic that had been collected in Australia by moni\u00ad\ntoring Moscow's Embassy in Canberra. More senior figures such \nas John Tiltman did not give them much attention, since Phillips \nand Howse initially thought much of the traffic to be low-level \nconsular material. In 1947 GCHQ received a further briefing, \nthis time from Meredith Gardner, the key American analyst of \nthe Venona messages. However, GCHQ did not set up a proper \nVenona office at Eastcote until December 1947, sparked by the \nrecognition that the Australian material was actually KGB \ntraffic.23 Eastcote was itself in a state of permanent revolution, \nwith sections being constantly reformed and merged, to the extent \nthat the 'rumblings of reorganisation' drew comment from figures \nlike Joseph Wenger, Washington's senior naval code-breaker.24 \nThe rumblings were the sounds of growth. From an establish\u00ad\nment of just over a thousand in December 1945, GCHQ was \nnudging three thousand staff by 1948, and was already looking \nfor new premises to accommodate its swelling numbers.25 \nThe British had also collected plenty of interesting wartime \nKGB traffic. As early as June 1943, Alastair Denniston had met \nColonel Ted Maltby of the Radio Security Service, together with \nRoger Hollis and John Curry of MIS, to discuss 'the intercep\u00ad\ntion of certain apparently illicit transmissions from this country \nwhich have been \"DF-ed\" to the Soviet Embassy'. ('DF'referred \nto the technique of radio direction-finding by triangulating \nbetween several aerials, sometimes mounted on detector vans.) \nThese messages had attracted interest because they had nothing \nin common with the old Comintern style of transmissions, and \nit was noted that they might well be KGB traffic as they showed \n'great technical skill'. Collecting this material stretched Britain's \ninterceptor resources, since the traffic had lasted for eight hours \nsolid in every twenty-four-hour period. Meanwhile, it was also \nsearching for an illegal Comintern radio station in Wimbledon, \nusing a disguised Ford Thames van with direction-finding equip\u00ad\nment and security personnel in civilian clothes.26 \n80 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nBy 1948, the Venona teams at GCHQ and Arlington Hall were \nsmall but extremely integrated. Although the British employed \na different code name for Venona, calling it 'Bride', they adopted \na standard procedure for the translations. The British cell was \nsuperintended by William Bodsworth, one of the initial team \nthat began studying Enigma in 1937.27 Like so many interwar \ncode-breakers, Bodsworth was a linguist, not a mathematician, \nhaving read Spanish at Cambridge. Cheerful and possessed of \na gentle humour, he was dubbed 'Snow White' because of his \nmop of white hair. Bodsworth's team undertook much of the \nlaborious task of trying to reconstruct the Soviet codebooks. The \nseven dwarfs supplied almost enough nicknames for the Venona \nteams: by the end of 1950, the number of people at Eastcote \nworking on 'Bride' remained at less than ten. For the Americans, \nBritish input was essential both to the efforts to track down the \nidentity of figures like 'Homer' and to obtaining background \nmaterial to allow the analysis of the KGB's Canberra messages.28 \nIt is almost certain that the first person to alert the Soviets \nto the existence of the Venona project in any detail was a KGB \nagent named Willi2.m Weisband. Born in the Soviet Union in \n1908, Voldya Weisband had emigrated with his family to the \nUnited States in the 1920s. In 1940 he had changed his name \nto William, and had registered at the American University in \nWashington DC. By 1942 he was serving as a lieutenant in a \nUS Army code-breaking unit in the Middle East. He was posted \nback to Arlington Hall in July 1944, and was soon working in \nthe Soviet section. Weisband had in fact been a KGB agent since \n1934, and he certainly displayed all the traits of a classic agent. \nGregarious and popular, he had friends throughout what was \nnow called the Army Security Agency, and charmed the senior \nofficers. His reputation as a problem-solver allowed him wide \naccess within the Soviet section, and Meredith Gardner actu\u00ad\nally recalls him looking at a list of names derived from Venona \nmaterial in late 1946. Weisband was not himself identified by \nVenona, but seeing the messages decrypted must had made him \nfeel queasy, since his name -or at least his code name 'Zhora' \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 81 \n-was certainly buried in traffic somewhere. In 1948 the Soviets \nsummarised Weisband's reports that had been fed back to KGB \nheadquarters in Moscow. They contained worrying news: \n* For one year, a large amount of very valuable documentary \nmaterial concerning the work of the Americans on deci\u00ad\nphering Soviet cyphers, intercepting and analysing open-radio \ncorrespondence of Soviet Institutions was received ... On the \nbasis of Weisband material, our state security organs carried \nout a number of defensive measures, resulting in the reduced \nefficiency of the American deciphering service. This has led \nto a considerable current reduction in the amount of de\u00ad\nciphering and analysis by the Americans.29 \n* In May 1950 Weisband was named by another agent who had \nbeen revealed by Venona and interrogated by the FBI. \nAlthough Weisband was questioned, there was insufficient \nevidence to charge him. There was also a fear that a court \ncase would advertise the work of signals intelligence to other \ncountries, which !night then take steps to upgrade their \ncommunications. He was never prosecuted for espionage.3D \nYet Weisband caused immense damage to Western code\u00ad\nbreaking. On Friday, 29 October 1948 the Soviets implemented \na massive change in all their communications security procedures. \nAmerican code-breakers referred to this fateful event as 'Black \nFriday'. Many Soviet radio nets moved over to one-time pads, \nwhich henceforth were not reused. Much of the procedural mate\u00ad\nrial that had been sent 'in clear', or unencrypted, between oper\u00ad\nators running medium-grade Army, Navy, Air Force and Police \nsystems, was now encrypted for the first time. Operator chatter \nwas banned. In the space of twenty-four hours, most Soviet \nsystems from which the West had been deriving intelligence were \n1051.31 This affected the 'Poets Systems' which the British and \nAmericans had been reading successfully as a result of their raids \ninto Germany in 1945.32 This was the most serious British intelli\u00ad\ngence loss of the early Cold War. \n82 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nFor the British, Venona was full of irony. As a joint \nprogramme with the Americans it symbolised the highest level \nof trust. However, its subsequent revelations damaged the most \nimportant parts 'of the transatlantic relationship, including \nagreements on code-breaking and atomic cooperation. This was \nbecause in early 1950 Venona uncovered Klaus Fuchs, who \nhad come to Los Alamos as part of the British contribution to \nthe Manhattan Programme, but was in fact an agent for the \nKGB. Venona also raised serious doubts about the possibility \nof Anglo-American-Commonwealth sigint and defence coop\u00ad\neration because of the number of KGB agents identified in \nAustralia. Directly or indirectly, Venona also exposed four of \nthe KGB's top agents inside the British establishment: Kim \nPhilby, Donald Maclean, Guy Burgess and John Cairncross. The \nmain problem for the KGB was that it did not know how many \nof its previous messages had been broken by the Venona project, \nand which of its agents had been exposed. This made it hard \nfor it to warn specific agents. Venona also contributed to Soviet \nparanoia about double agents who might be planting disinfor\u00ad\nmation. The KGB's strange tendency not to wholly trust even \nits best sources, including the SIS officer Kim Philby, was one \nmanifestation of this.33 \nIn August 1949 Philby returned from a posting in Istanbul \nto London. He was preparing to take over from Peter Dwyer as \nSIS liaison officer with the CIA in Washington, and was briefed \nby Sir Stewart Menzies, Chief of SIS, together with two of his \nsenior officers, James Easton and Maurice Oldfield. Oldfield, \nwhose responsibility was counter-intelligence, explained Venona \nto him in detail. Philby's blood probably ran cold as Oldfield \nobserved that they had broken about 10 per cent of the KGB's \nWashington-Moscow telegrams and were now searching for a \nBritish diplomat working for the KGB and code-named \n'Homer'.34 Philby immediately requested a conference with his \nKGB controller, Yuri Modin. The KGB station in the Soviet \nEmbassy in London reported the crisis that now confronted \nthem: \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT \n* Stanley [Philby] asked to communicate that the Americans \nand the British had constructed a deciphering machine \nwhich in one day does 'the work of a thousand people in \na thousand years'. Work on deciphering is facilitated by \nthree factors: (1) A one-time pad used twice; (2) our cipher \nresembles the cipher of our trade organisation in the USA; \n(3) a half-burnt code book has been found in Finland and \npassed to the British and used to decrypt our communi\u00ad\ncations. They will succeed within the next twelve months. \nThe Charles [Klaus Fuchs] case has shown the counter\u00ad\nintelligence service the importance of knowing the past of \ncivil servants ... Stanley, Paul [Guy Burgess], and Yan \n[Anthony Blunt] consider that the situation is serious\u00b735 \n* 83 \nYuri Modin recalls that Venona 'hung over us like the sword \nof Damocles'.36 Nevertheless, he and Philby agreed gloomily \nthat in the short term there was nothing they could do, 'only \nwait and behave with extreme care and caution'.37 Arriving in \nWashington in November 1949, Philby was offered a ringside \nseat on Venona. He was given Venona summaries by the GCHQ \nliaison officer in Washington, and was actually taken to \nArlington and briefed on the project in detail several times.38 \nIncredibly, in July 1950 he put in a successful request for GCHQ \nto give him an extra copy of any Venona-related material it \nwas sending to the Americans in Washington, so he could peruse \nit at leisure. In any other circumstances this would have been \nan espionage triumph, but it caused Philby no joy. The arrests \nat this time of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, perhaps the most \nfamous figures ever to be charged with espionage for the Soviet \nUnion, cannot have calmed his nerves.39 \nUnderstandably, the Americans had initially refused to show \nthe British the KGB Washington-Moscow traffic.40 This delayed \nthe search for the Foreign Office spy code-named 'Homer', who \neventually turned out to be Donald Maclean. In 1947, the earliest \nperiod of good code recovery, analysts knew that several messages \n84 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nfrom late March 1944 began with a stock preamble and greeting. \nSuch standard openings were a gift for code-breakers. In this case \nit read: 'To the 8th section. Material \"G\".' The Eighth section was \nthought to receive political intelligence, and short breaks in other \nKGB messages showed that the material concerned Britain's \nAmbassador in Washington, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. By December \n1948, further work by Philip Howse revealed that it seemed to \noriginate from telegrams sent by Churchill. In January 1949, after \na month of frantic night-time digging in the registry of the Foreign \nOffice (a daytime search would have alerted the regular diplo\u00ad\nmatic staff), the originals were found. The circle of suspects was \ngradually narrowing. The final breakthrough came in August 1950, \nwhen the Americans recovered two short stretches of material \nthat referred to 'Homer' being entrusted with decyphering a \ntelegram from 'Boar' [Churchill] to 'Captain' [Roosevelt]. This \npointed directly to someone in Britain's wartime Washington \nEmbassy, and the finger of suspicion began to circle over the heads \nof a very few people. Further work on the messages suggested \nthat 'Homer' was married. However, it was only on 30 March \n1951 that the code-breakers were sure that 'G' and 'Homer' were \nthe same. This information placed him in New York in June 1944.4l \nAt this moment, Philby knew that Maclean had been identi\u00ad\nfied. However, he also knew that MI5 would have to gather tradi\u00ad\ntional evidence against him to support an arrest, so a window of \nopportunity existed. Philby's friend and fellow Soviet agent, the \ndiplomat Guy Burgess, was being sent home from Washington \nin disgrace after an especially embarrassing drunken episode, and \nPhilby used him to pass a message to Yuri Modin, their KGB \ncontroller in London. On Friday, 25 May 1951, Burgess and \nMaclean fled from Britain on a ferry to St Malo. It was a narrow \nescape: MI5 had planned to confront Maclean when he turned \nup for work the following Monday. Once in France, a KGB contact \nhanded them false papers which ensured that they could travel \nin relative safety across Europe towards Moscow. The false papers \nwere essential, since by now every security service in Europe was \nlooking for them. Inevitably, suspicion also fell on Philby, not \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 85 \nleast because Burgess had been lodging with him in Washington, \nbut there was no hard evidence. Philby was recalled and forced \ninto retirement, but no other action was taken against him.42 \nVenona also had ramifications in the British Commonwealth. \nIn July 1947, Field Marshal Montgomery, now Chief of the \nImperial General Staff, had held a meeting with Australia's \nMinister for External Affairs, Dr H.Y. Evatt, about joint weapons \ndevelopment in Australia. Montgomery noted that 'good secur\u00ad\nity precautions are very necessary' because of the appearance \nin Australia of a spy who was connected to the Igor Gouzenkou \ncase, in which a defecting KGB cypher clerk had revealed a \nmajor spy ring in Ottawa in 1946. But in November and \nDecember 1947 Venona revealed that despite enhanced secur\u00ad\nity precautions, sensitive documents were regularly leaking from \nCanberra to the KGB.43 These revelations soon made their way \nto the highest level. On 27 January 1948, Admiral Roscoe \nHillenkoeter, Director of the CIA, warned President Truman: \n'Indications have appeared that there is a leak in high govern\u00ad\nment circles in Australia, to Russia.' He explained that MI5 was \nengaged in expansive undercover investigations to determine \njust where the leakages were.44 Highly sensitive material had \nbeen passed to the KGB from the Department of External Affairs \nin Canberra. The Soviets considered it to be spectacular stuff, \nfor it included copies of the 'explosive' future strategy papers \ndrafted by the British Post Hostilities Planning Committee, or \n'PHP'. This was bare-faced anti-Soviet planning material, \nprepared with the encouragement of the British Chiefs of Staff, \nthat had already resulted in rows in Whitehall. Anthony Eden, \nthen Foreign Secretary, had banned its circulation abroad in late \n1944, but by then it was too late, and the volatile PHP reports \nhad already made their way via Canberra to Moscow.45 The \nKGB chief in Australia considered the PHP papers to be such \nan important coup that he asked Moscow for permission to send \nthem by cypher rather than courier. This was a bad mistake, \nfor the two lengthy papers, 'Security in the Western \nMediterranean and the Eastern Atlantic' and 'Security of India \n86 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nand the Indian Ocean', provided the code-breakers with a vast \nword-for-word 'crib' to get into other Soviet traffic.46 Partly \nbecause it was relatively easy to identify which documents had \nbeen taken in Australia, the KGB Moscow-Canberra cables \nproved to be the most successful part of the Venona operation. \nRemarkably, by early 1948 so much progress had been made \nthat GCHQ was virtually reading the messages in real time.47 \nLondon did not regard the Australians as competent enough \nto handle this security crisis. In February 1948 Sir Percy Sillitoe, \nthe head of MI5, was despatched to Australia. With him came \nRoger Hollis, head of MI5's C Division (later himself wrongly \naccused of working for the KGB), concerned with protective secur\u00ad\nity and background checks, and another senior security officer, \nRoger Hemblys-Scales. With Courtney Young, MI5's resident \nSecurity Liaison Officer in Australia, they persuaded the Prime \nMinister, Ben Chifley and Defence Minister, Frederick Shedden, \nto permit vigorous investigations. In July, following further discus\u00ad\nsions with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee, the Australians \naccepted British proposals for the creation of an Australian equiv\u00ad\nalent of MI5 later known as the Australian Security Intelligence \nOrganisation (ASIO).48 Sillitoe returned to London, but Hollis and \nHemblys-Scales remained in Australia to set up ASIO and work \non the list of Venona suspects, which numbered twelve. \nThereafter, ASIO was almost entirely focused on what it called \n'The Case'. Tracing documents quoted in KGB traffic indicated \nlikely suspects, including a typist, Frances Bernie, who helped \nto run a Communist youth league and who worked personally \nfor Dr Evatt, the Minister for External Affairs. It also pointed \nto two Australian diplomats with Communist leanings, Ian \nMilner and Jim Hill. Hollis and Courtney Young did not tell the \nAustralians that the names came from intercepts, but the nature \nof the material led some of the more experienced ASIO hands \nto suspect sigint as the key source. Some of the suspects were \nreferred to by code names rather than real names, and their \nidentities could only be deduced by careful circumstantial guess\u00ad\nwork. Miiner and Hill, who were identified positively, refused \nTHE KGB AND THE VENONA PROJECT 87 \nto 'come over'. William Skardon, MIS's most experienced inter\u00ad\nrogator, made a soft approach to Hill when he visited London \nin 1950, trying to persuade him to 'be sensible' and 'make a \nclean breast of it', but Hill denied everything.49 \nThe 'Venona Twelve' kept ASIO's staff of close to two hundred \nbusy well into the 1950s. Each new suspect opened a world of \nfurther associates and contacts who required separate examina\u00ad\ntion. The task was difficult, since the Communist Party of Australia \nhad long expected to be banned, and had built up a substantial \nunderground organisation. Not unlike the Communist Party of \nIndia, seasoned by years of security attention, it had also achieved \nsome infiltration of the police. Even the infiltration of ASIO seemed \na possibility. ASIO's staff worked around the clock watching and \nbugging the flats of suspect Soviet diplomats in Canberra. Each \nvisitor was tailed and investigated. ASIO's staff were learning the \nhardest lesson of counter-espionage and counter-subversion: \nworking security cases really diligently only manufactured more \nleads and opened more cases. 50 Almost a quarter of the Venona \nmessages relating to Canberra still remain classified, presumably \nbecause they relate ta KGB agents not pursued or prosecuted.51 \nThe British and Australians were not alone in suffering KGB \npenetration. Although headlines about Klaus Fuchs and Donald \nMaclean generated anxiety about Britain amongst the American \nelite, those on the inside knew Washington had its fair share of \nSoviet agents. Venona uncovered spies in the State Department, \nthe Treasury, even in the White House. They included Harry \nDexter White, a senior Treasury officiaL and Laughlin Currie, \nwho had been a personal assistant to Franklin D. Roosevelt. This \nwas not particularly surprising, since the vast influx of academics \nand scientists moving into government work during wartime \nhad inevitably included some Communist Party sympathisers. \nThe Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the CIA, which \nhad recruited heavily from the East Coast academic establish\u00ad\nment, harboured perhaps a dozen people working for the Soviets. \nVenona had profound implications for the development of \nthe security state in America, Britain, Canada and Australia. \n88 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nJust at the moment when the public were anxious to throw off \nthe claustrophobic constraints of wartime security, officials were \nconfronted with irrefutable evidence of a massive programme \nof Soviet espionage. Selling strong security measures in the late \n1940s was an uphill task. This was nowhere more true than in \nAustralia. The creation of ASIO by a Labor Prime Minister, Ben \nChifley, was a remarkable development. Like the British Labour \nParty, its Australian counterpart had historically been sceptical \nabout surveillance, associating it with right-wing anti-union \nactivities. In Britain too, Venona led indirectly to the introduc\u00ad\ntion of detailed personal background checks, or 'positive vetting', \nfor officials. British civil servants resisted the idea, but it was \nincreasingly clear that without it, Anglo-American strategic \ncooperation on matters like atomic energy was likely to end.52 \nVenona represents a documentary source of high value, and \nhas helped to resolve some of the most bitterly contested Cold \nWar espionage cases. These include the famously controversial \ncases of the atomic scientist Julius Rosenberg and the diplomat \nAlger Hiss, who were both active espionage agents for the \nSoviets. In these important cases, Venona offers us what Nigel \nWest has rightly called 'a glimpse of the unvarnished truth'.53 \nAt the same time, much of the Venona material is rather frag\u00ad\nmentary, and in 1995 it was further obfuscated by the lamen\u00ad\ntable decision of the British and American governments to blank \nout some names on grounds of potential political embarrass\u00ad\nment. Some KGB code names for individuals were re-used and \ngiven to more than one person. Moreover, it is possible that a \nminority of the people who appear in the Venona cables did \nnot knowingly have a relationship with Soviet intelligence offi\u00ad\ncers, or were identified as possible targets for future recruit\u00ad\nment, but were never actually recruited. The tendency of some \nintelligence officers to exaggerate their triumphs has also to be \nborne in mind. In short, Venona has provided us with fabulous \nrevelations, but the full story awaits the moment when histo\u00ad\nrians access the files of the KGB and Soviet military intelligence, \nor GRU, in Moscow. That will not happen for a long time yet. \n5 \nU!(USA -Creating the \nGlobal Sigint Alliance \nMuch discussion about 100 per cent cooperation with the USA \nabout SlG INT. Decided that less than 100 per cent cooperation \nwas not worth having. \nAdmiral Andrew Cunningham, Chief of the Naval Staff, \n21 November 19451 \nOne of the most important legacies of the Second World War \nwas the creation of the vast global signals intelligence alliance \nknown as 'UKUSA'. The signing of the UKUSA intelligence \ntreaty between Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia \nand New Zealand has long been regarded as marking the birth \nof a secretive leviathan, a global multilateral alliance that has \ngrown to embrace Gumerous countries and to command almost \nunlimited intelligence power. Its origins are often traced to a \nsingle landmark treaty between Britain, the United States and \nthe Commonwealth deemed to be concluded in 1948. Indeed, \nthe highly classified UKUSA treaty is widely considered to be \nnothing less than the linchpin of the West's post-war intelli\u00ad\ngence system. UKUSA supposedly created a cosy Anglo-Saxon \nclub sharing everything in the super-secret realm of sigint. \nRemarkably, there is in fact no singular UKUSA 'treaty' of \n1948, and none of the above assertions is true. Instead, UKUSA \nis less an alliance than a complex network of different alliances \nbuilt up from many different overlapping agreements. It is the \nsum of a curious agglomeration of many understandings that \nwere mostly between two countries only, that accumulated \nover more than two decades.2 Britain and the United States \nconcluded the main agreements in 1943 and 1946, together \nwith a further convention in 1948. According to the historian \n90 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nPeter Hennessy they are still in force, and as recently as August \n2006, some sixty years on, the authorities deemed them so \nsensitive that, after anxious deliberation, they announced that \nthey could not be released.3 Further agreements were added \n-and continue to be added -creating a complex spider's web \nof cooperation. However, each agreement has its limits, and \nall parties have withheld sigint material from each other. In \nshort, there is no common pooling of material. Moreover, rela\u00ad\ntions between the various parties have often been tense, and \nlatterly Washington has threatened some adherents, including \nBritain, Australia and New Zealand, with suspension or exclu\u00ad\nsion. If UKUSA is an alliance, its members are only 'allies of \na kind'.4 \nIt is also wrong to think of UKUSA as exclusively concerned \nwith sigint. It is, rather, a sigint and security network. Security \nagreements on physical control of the sigint product and on \nprotecting the security of communications were perhaps the \nmost important aspects of the UKUSA network. Sigint reports \non particular subjects were rigidly compartmentalised and given \n'Codeword' status, ensuring that they could only be seen by \npeople cleared to see that series, and making them effectively \n'above Top Secret'. Venona is the best-known example of such \na Codeword. Much of this obsessive secrecy was codified in a \nbiblical tome entitled 'International Regulations on Sigint', or \n'IRSIG', which had reached its third edition by 1967.5 UKUSA \nwas also about secretly undermining the communications secur\u00ad\nity of other states, even neutrals and allies. Communications \nsecurity, or 'comsec', is perhaps even more sensitive than sigint. \nThe efforts of the UKUSA powers to control it have been among \nthe darkest secrets of alliance politics in Western Europe. In \nshort, the realm of sigint alliances is profoundly realist -at times \neven paranoid -with operators 'taking what they can get'. While \nUKUSA might appear from the outside to represent a single \npowerful intelligence colossus, on the inside it was anything \nbut unified. \nThe best example of allies spying on allies is provided by \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 91 \nFinland. The end of the Second World War had not turned out \nwell for the Finns, sillce their Russian enemy had returned to \nthe Baltic in overwhelming strength. Anticipating the arrival of \nthe Russians, the talented Finnish code-breakers decamped en \nmasse to Sweden, complete with their relatives, equipment and \nsupport staff. There they began a veritable car-boot sale of their \ncryptographic wares, including the results of sixteen years of \ncontinuous work againsI Russian systems. The beauty of selling \ncodes is that the same items can be sold many times over. \nPredictably, the Finns paid their ground rent by assisting the \nSwedish equivalent of Bletchley Park, the F6rvarets Radioanstalt, \nor FRA. In the last days of the war they also sold complete \nRussian codebooks to the American wartime intelligence agency, \nthe Office of Strategic Services, to Britain's SIS and also to the \nJapanese. They also sold the Americans the details of the British \ncodes they had broken, and work they had completed against \nsome US State Department cyphers. The Americans were eager \ncustomers. This episode -known as the 'Stella Polaris' case \nbecause of its northern origins -underlines the duplicitous \nnature of friendships in the realm of code-breaking.6 \nIn the autumn of 1945, even while the Stella Polaris case \nwas 'live', President Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, was \nengaged in the abolition of the Office of Strategic Services. Two \nyears later its remnants would be revived to become the Central \nIntelligence Agency, but for now many of its intelligence offi\u00ad\ncers were dispersed and its agents paid off. By contrast, Truman \nregarded sigint as indispensable, and secretly gave permission \nfor the American code-breaking agencies to work on into the \npost-war period and 'to continue collaboration in the field of \ncommunication intelligence between the United States Army \nand Navy and the British'.7 All major countries desired the \nmaximum world coverage. On 19 November 1945, Admiral \nAndrew Cunningham, Britain's senior naval commander, \nattended a critical meeting of the British Chiefs of Staff. There \nwas 'Much discussion about 100 per cent cooperation with the \nUSA about Sigint,' he recorded, adding that they 'Decided that \n92 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nless than 100 per cent was not worth having.' In Ottawa, George \nGlazebrook, a senior Canadian diplomat, recommended to the \nCanadian Joint Intelligence Committee that Canada enhance \nher independent sigint effort in order to stake a claim in this \nsecretive emerging cooperative system. 'It is paramount,' he \ninsisted, 'that Canada should make an adequate contribution to \nthe general pool.'B \nYet a 'general pool' was not what emerged. Moreover, the \nway ahead was strewn with obstacles and tortuous negotiations. \nThe complex package of agreements, letters and memoranda of \nunderstanding was not completed until 1953. In this process, \nBritain derived considera.ble benefit from her dominance over \nher Commonwealth partners and her imperial bases. GCHQ's \napproach was to align her Commonwealth affiliates to create a \ncritical mass before entering negotiations with the Americans. \nThe story of Britain's sigint relations with Australia illustrates \nthis well. In March 1945, with the end of the European war \nlooming, Edward Travis set off from Bletchley Park on a veri\u00ad\ntable world sigint tour. The possibility of transforming wartime \ncooperative arrangements into a post-war sigint alliance was \nalready in his mind.9 En route, he and his party visited major \nsigint centres at Heliopolis in Egypt and HMS Anderson in \nCeylon. They arrived in Melbourne in early April, and spent \ntime with the Australian code-breaking organisation there, called \nthe Central Bureau. On 17 April they departed for New Zealand \nand then moved on to Hawaii, San Francisco and finally \nWashington. By the time they reached Hawaii they were running \nlow on funds, and had to beg a cash advance from the Foreign \nOffice before they could proceed further. At each stop, the possi\u00ad\nbility of continued post-war cooperation was gently raised.1O \nRelations with the Australians were somewhat awkward. \nTypically, London had reluctantly agreed that Sir Frederick \nShedden, the new Australian Defence Minister, could be indoc\u00ad\ntrinated into the secrets of sigint, but only so he could use his \npower to prevent a reduction of Australian spending on intel\u00ad\nligence. There had also been alleged leaks about intelligence in \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 93 \nCanberra, and in September 1945 there were momentary doubts \nas to whether any cooperation with Australia on sigint would \nbe authorised.11 Indeed, by December 1945 a 'dangerous posi\u00ad\ntion' had developed, with the Australians seeming to want to \ngo it alone with their own system; what was worse, there were \nrival elements within the Australian armed services. British \nliaison officers warned, 'If we are not prompt to give a lead \nthere may even be 3 or 4 rival shows in Australia with no hope \nof proper security.' During the war, material collected in \nAustralia and the Far East had often been sent back to Britain \nfor analysis. However, there was now a possibility that the \nAustralians might end up 'insisting on full exploitation in \nAustralia'. This was a situation that British code-breakers \nwanted to avoid at all costs, since final exploitation was power, \nand they wished to keep their Commonwealth associates in a \nsubordinate position.12 \nThe crucial moment in the creation of the global sigint alliance \noccurred on 22 February 1946, when Britain opened a two\u00ad\nweek Commonwealth conference for 'Signals Intelligence \nAuthorities'. This gave them critical mass prior to concluding a \ndeal with the Americans the following month. The attendance \nof Australia and Canada was a foregone conclusion, and given \nthe significant contribution that New Zealand had made during \nthe war to naval sigint, there were hopes that she would also \njoin in.l3 The conference was also attended by senior officers \nfrom GCHQ's regional centres. Bruce Keith, the commander of \nHMS Anderson, the massive sigint collection station in Ceylon, \nwas there, accompanied by his deputy, Teddy Poulden.14 At this \nconference Australia offered sixty-five operating teams, \namounting to 417 personnel, from the three armed services as \nits contribution to a new global sigint network. IS Australia was \npersuaded to set up a British-style Joint Intelligence Committee \nand, most importantly, a unitary Signals Intelligence Centre \nalong the lines of GCHQ, which was given the cover name \nDefence Signals Branch.16 \nThe big issue was the choice of the director of Australian sigint. \n94 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nThe Australians fielded four candidates, all experienced wartime \nintelligence officers. However, Travis told them bluntly that it \nwould be a British officer. Some Australians were affronted, but \non balance Travis's dedsi0n was probably correct, since it ensured \nthat Australia would have good access to British sigint. Travis's \nchoice was Teddy Poulden, who had spent the last two years of \nthe war as deputy to Bruce Keith, the commander of HMS \nAnderson, on CeylonP Poulden took over in April 1947, \ncommanding a staff of around two hundred, about twenty of \nwhom were GCHQ personnel on secondment. Although senior \nAustralian sigint officers resented the fact that Poulden had his \nown private cypher for communicating with Travis, he was broadly \nconsidered to have done a good job. In the early 1950s he was \nsucceeded by an Australian, Ralph Thompson, who remained in \nthe position until 1978, making him easily the longest-serving \nWestern sigint chief. 18 In January 1947 a further Commonwealth \nsigint conference was held in London, and the Chifley govern\u00ad\nment gave final approval for the integration of Australian sigint \ninto UKUSA at the end of the year.19 However, this was delayed \nby the security COGcerns raised by Venona, so there was little \nsigint contact between Australia and the United States until 1949 .20 \nCanada's slgmt organisation under the long-serving \nLieutenant Colonel Edward Drake suffered similar 'colonial' \ntreatment. Although Drake was a Canadian, his deputy was the \nstalwart British code-breaker and expert on Russian systems \nGeoffrey Stevens, who arrived to take up his post in Ottawa in \nMarch 1946. A few weeks later, on 13 April, the Canadian Prime \nMinister Mackenzie King authorised the consolidation of a \nnumber of wartime organisations into a small post-war unit of \nabout a hundred staff known as the Communications Branch \nof the National Research Council (CBNRC). A number of senior \nposts were filled by staff seconded by GCHQ, prompting locals \nto observe that CBNRC stood for 'Communications Branch -\nNo Room for Canadians'. By the late 1940s Drake had resolved \nto offset this British oligopoly by developing better relations \nwith the US Army code-breakers.21 \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 95 \nThe two-week sigint conference that GCHQ had convened \nwith the Commonwealth partners in February 1946 was a vital \nprelude to business with the Americans the following monthY \nIndeed, the Australians and Canadians had given GCHQ permis\u00ad\nsion to negotiate on their behalfY On 6 March, William \nFriedman, one of the US Army's most senior code-breakers, \narrived in London to complete a revised version of the previous \nwartime agreements between Britain and the United States. The \nmain section of the agreement which followed this policy confer\u00ad\nence between the principals was only four pages long; however, \na UK-USA Technical Conference followed in June 1946 which \nadded many annexes and appendices. Much of this new mat\u00ad\nerial was about attempting to agree on security procedures for \nhandling sigint.24 The terms of the 1946 agreement are still \nhighly secret. Both parties agreed to 'pool their knowledge of \nforeign comint organizations', and that in any future negotia\u00ad\ntions with other parties 'every effort should be made to avoid \ndisclosure of US/UK collaboration in the COMINT field' .25 Joseph \nWenger, the head of America's naval code-breakers, accepted \nthat the 1946 conference had only dealt with generalities, and \nthis had generated 'some criticism'. Nevertheless, his priority \nwas to 'set up the framework and establish the will to make it \nwork', so in his view it was a great success, and 'laid the foun\u00ad\ndation of a very fruitful and important partnership'.26 \nFor GCHQ, liaison with allies was all-important to its new status \nas a proper intelligence agency in its own right. By the spring \nof 1946, Edward Travis was operating with two deputies at \nEastcote. Nigel de Grey was the senior deputy, and had respon\u00ad\nsibility for operational coordination between the five main \ngroups at GCHQ, together with recruitment, training and secur\u00ad\nity. Following the important allied sigint conferences of February \nand March 1946, Travis added a second deputy, a naval officer \ncalled Captain Edward Hastings who had much wartime exper\u00ad\nience of working with Canada. His responsibilities included \nliaison with the US, the Commonwealth and India, together \n96 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nwith managing GCHQ's overseas collection stations.27 \nGCHQ's strategy for cooperation with the Americans was to \nrapidly reorientate its collection towards Russia. Typically, the \nvast Forest Moor wireless station near Harrogate in Yorkshire, \nwith an aerial farm of some ten square miles, was switched from \ncollecting German traffic from the Eastern Front to Russian traffic \nas soon as the war drew to an end. British field units in Germany, \nAustria and Italy joined the suborned Italians in collecting Russian \nmilitary traffic. The re-established sigint stations in Singapore \nand Hong Kong also focused on Russian traffic, with the latter \nspecialising in KGB messages. All this made Britain an attrac\u00ad\ntive partner for the United States.28 The core of Anglo-American \ncooperation was a 'relentless attack' on the wartime generation \nof Russian cyphers. Figures like John Tiltman and Hugh \nAlexander provided the code-breaking expertise, while the \nAmericans provided most of the processing capability. 29 \nAll the three American armed services were routinely circu\u00ad\nlated with GCHQ finished product on Russia. A key instrument \nwas the 'Comintsum', a digest of the latest 'hot' material which \nmade its way around comint-cleared centres. London would \nsend twenty copies of this sort of document to Washington on \na regular basis, with two copies going to US Air Force intelli\u00ad\ngence, two to US Army intelligence and so forth.3D On Russian \nmilitary targets at least, the British and Americans operated \nsmoothly as one machine. A very high priority was given to \njoint planning for the use of nuclear weapons in any future \nwar. As early as 28 April 1948, General Charles Cabell, head of \nUS Air Force intelligence, reviewed the intelligence arrange\u00ad\nments in support of the current emergency atomic strike plan \n'Operation Halfmoon'. 'At the present time,' he noted with satis\u00ad\nfaction, 'there is complete interchange of communications intel\u00ad\nligence information between the cognizant United States and \nBritish agencies. It is not believed that the present arrangements \n... could be improved.'3l This was cemented by a further Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican agreement on communications intelligence signed in \nJune 1948. \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 97 \nHowever, the sharing of material on other parts of the world \nremained selective, reflecting the political tensions of the \nmoment. In 1948, even while the UKUSA alliance was gradu\u00ad\nally being drawn together, Britain and America were at logger\u00ad\nheads over Palestine and the emerging state of Israel. There was \nanxiety in London about sharing intelligence on the Middle East \nwith the Americans. On 15 February 1948, Britain's Joint \nIntelligence Committee discussed the problem of circulating its \nown reports, which included material from SIS and GCHQ, to \nthe newly formed CIA. Although British intelligence represen\u00ad\ntatives in Washington were not aware of a specific 'pro-Zionist \nbloc in the Central Intelligence Agency', nevertheless they \nasserted that 'Jewish sympathisers were no doubt included in \nits establishment', and complained that there had been leaks. \nWilliam Hayter, the Chair of the JIC, insisted that its material \non Palestine should be shown in the first instance only to the \nDirector of Central Intelligence in person. He added that 'It \nshould be explained to him that if he could not guarantee that \nthey would not fall imo pro-Zionist hands, then he could not \nbe left with them.' Even so, it was decided to withhold more \nsensitive recent reports on Palestine from the Americans.32 \nMeanwhile, 'Operation Gold', run by US Navy intelligence, was \nintercepting the cable traffic of Jewish arms smugglers, but this \nwas not being shared with Britain, or indeed acted upon.33 \nAmerican links with the Commonwealth parties were also \nhesitant. The Americans were slow to do business with the \nCanadians. They worried about how much GCHQ had told the \nCanadians about Anglo-American agreements, and suspected \nthat GCHQ was secretly giving Ottawa some American sigint.34 \nDuring the 1948 discussions of possible CAN-USA sigint agree\u00ad\nments, it became clear that the US Communications Intelligence \nBoard was anxious to prevent an information free-for-all. It \npreferred to hand material to the Canadians on a 'need to know' \nbasis, and was anxious to prevent a proliferation of sigint liaison \nofficers.35 Meanwhile, somewhat foolishly, Canada resisted the \nall-important standardisation of security procedures that was a \n98 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nfoundation stone of the BRUSA agreement, so negotiations were \n'very difficult', dragging on until 1953.36 The Americans were \neven more wary of sigint cooperation with the Australians due \nto the KGB spy cases uncovered by Venona in the late 1940s. \nThis, in turn, retarded the joint sigint effort against the newly \nformed People's Republic of China from 1949. In late 1953, the \nadvent of a Liberal (Le. conservative) government in Australia \ntriggered a full resumption of cooperation, formalised at a tripar\u00ad\ntite sigint conference between the Americans, British and \nAustralians. New Zealand also came in as fifth partner. It was \nonly at this point that the name 'UKUSA' was adopted at GCHQ's \nrequest.37 \nThe most prickly area of alliance relations was the business \nof cypher security, which protected the secrecy of diplomatic \ncommunications. Foolishly perhaps, at a meeting in London in \nMay 1947, the British launched an audacious bid to persuade \nthe Americans to share the innermost secrets on matters of their \ncode-making. The discussion revolved around the replacement \nof the Combined Cypher Machine, which had been developed \nfor inter-allied communications during the war, but was now \nthought obsolete and vulnerable. The British were also keen to \nreplace their own national machine, the Typex, but were desper\u00ad\nately short of money as a result of post-war austerity, and argued \nthat for reasons of economy any new cypher machines should \nbe capable of inter-allied use, and proposed joint research and \ndevelopment with the Americans.38 The Americans were star\u00ad\ntled: it had been a cardinal principle never to share the secrets \nof their unique and highly prized Sigaba machine. Hoping to \novercome this psychological barrier, the British revealed that \nthey were in fact already knowledgeable about Sigaba. They \nnot only described its inner workings 'quite accurately', but \nconfessed that they had 'incorporated its principles in a radiotele\u00ad\ntype machine for their own use'. Hoping that they had pushed \nthe Sigaba obstacle aside, the British then made their pitch. \nThey claimed that they had developed an approach to cypher \nmachines that was 'new and revolutionary', and 'superior to \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 99 \nthe Sigaba principle'. They were happy to share this with the \nAmericans, and perhaps make use of it in joint machines that \nmight be developed for both national and allied use. \nFar from being reassured, the Americans were horrified. \nDiscussion had to be 'temporarily discontinued' while they with\u00ad\ndrew to confer amongst themselves. The US Army could see no \nobjection to releasing the Sigaba principle for use in a combined \nallied machine, since the British had dearly unravelled it. \nHowever, the US Navy offered 'serious objections', and used \ntheir veto. Thus the British were told that Sigaba had to be \ncompletely eliminated from the discussions. At this point they \nrevealed their 'new and revolutionary idea' for future cypher \nmachines, only to find that their American colleagues sneered \nat it and dismissed it as 'impractical' on engineering grounds. \nThe two sides parted without agreement.39 \nWhile GCHQ was overawed by the scale of American sigint \nresources, matters looked quite different from Washington. With \nthe Second World War now over, and an economising Republican \nCongress controlling the federal purse-strings, resources for \nAmerican comint interception activities were remarkably tight. \nThis contributed to American under-preparedness prior to the \nKorean War. It also enforced a division of labour between GCHQ \nand the Americans, and prevented American sigint from \nexpanding its activities in Europe in the way it had hoped. In \n1949, US Army Security Agency interception units in Europe \nwere still passing much of their product to GCHQ for analysis, \nrather than back to Washington. Moreover, GCHQ retained \nprimary responsibility for areas such as Eastern Europe, the Near \nEast and Africa.40 Because of this division of labour, the late \n1940s saw the gradual development of American and British \nspheres of influence. In Scandinavia, for example, relations with \nNorway were an American responsibility, while those with the \nSwedes belonged to GCHQ, although this demarcation was not \nalways strictly adhered toY GCHQ enjoyed the additional bene\u00ad\nfits of the panoply of bases provided by Britain's imperial and \n100 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \npost-imperial presence. Although the Empire was shrinking, \nthe very process of retreat and the euphoria of independence \noften rendered the new successor states willing to grant limited \nbase facilities to the de:parting British. These 'communications \nrelay facilities' may have seemed innocuous, but in fact many \ncountries were unwitting hosts to important GCHQ collection \nsites.42 \nThe outbreak of the Korean War early on the morning of \nSunday, 25 June 1950 took Britain and the United States by \ncomplete surprise. Although they had co mint units in locations \nsuch as Hong Kong and Japan, their main focus was Russian \ntraffic, and their sigint capabilities against North Korea were \nnon-existent. The NSA official history notes that there was 'no \nperson or group of persons working on the North Korean \nproblem', and even had they done so, they had 'no Korean \nlinguists, no Korean dictionaries and no typewriters'. Although \nthe CIA had picked up what might be called 'rumours of war' \nfrom human agents, there was no high-profile attack warning \ndelivered to policy-makers. During the first few weeks of the \nwar, the Americans and their South Korean allies suffered serious \nreverses and were almost overrun. Sigint helped the Americans \nto beat back the attacks on their rapidly shrinking perimeter by \nproviding excellent tactical intelligence, but they blundered again \nby missing the entry of the Chinese into the war in October \n1950.43 \nThe Korean War resulted in a headlong expansion of American \nsigint. More than two thousand additional staff were recruited, \nand more than $ 5 million of additional spending on comint and \ncomsec was authorised within weeks of the war commencing.44 \nThe outbreak of the war also meant crash expansion in Asia. \nThe Americans informed London of their 'urgent need' for a \nUS Air Force sigint unit to be deployed to Hong Kong, and other \nsites were quickly developed on Taiwan in an attempt to remedy \nthe yawning intelligence gap in East Asia.45 \nKorea had another important impact. With new employees \nflooding into the training wing at Nebraska Avenue in central \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 101 \nWashington DC, the Americans soon had a vast backlog of people \nrequiring security clearance before they could begin work. By \nthe end of 1950, more than a third of sigint employees were \n'uncleared'. It was then discovered that since 1948 the CIA had \nbeen using the polygraph, or lie detector test, initially only to \nscreen people who had access to sigint, although its use was \nsoon extended to all CIA employees. By May 1951 it had been \nadopted for all American code-breakers, and polygraph exam\u00ad\niners were testing 'from seven in the morning till eleven at \nnight' to clear the backlog. Polygraphs soon became an embedded \npart of American sigint culture, but were not introduced at \nBritain's GCHQ.46 \nThe Korean War was of enormous importance for GCHQ \nbecause it fundamentally reshaped the American sigint commu\u00ad\nnity. There had been several failed attempts to create a single \nunified American sigint organisation along the lines of GCHQ.47 \nThe war broke the logjam. In 1952, President Truman suddenly \ninsisted on the creation of a strong central body called the \nNational Security Agency, or 'NSA', under General Ralph Canine. \nThe armed services fought a desperate rearguard action: in \nAugust 1952, General Samford of US Air Force intelligence \ndenounced Truman's desire for 'strong central control' as nothing \nshort of a 'major error'. However, Truman's mind was made \nup, and in November he signed the order for the reshaping of \nAmerican comint.48 NSA was given unambiguous control over \ncomint in a historic document called NSCID-9.49 This brought \nabout a reduction in, but not the elimination of, what the leading \nhistorian of NSA has called 'the fractious and seemingly never\u00ad\nending internecine warfare' between the American service \ncomint organisations. The British were immensely relieved. In \nthe background, figures like Edward Travis had been quietly \nurging inter-service unity on their American collaborators since \nthe summer of 1945.50 \nThe creation of NSA also had physical consequences. Up until \nthis point there had been a plan to relocate the headquarters of \nAmerican sigint to Fort Knox, near Louisville in Kentucky. \n102 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nHowever, it was now realised that the need for high-grade \ncommunications circuits and for civilian workers made this \nimpossible. The policy-makers, who were the consumers of their \nintelligence 'product' in Washington, also protested about the \nmove, rightly anticipating that it would mean a worse sigint \nservice. They insisted that the new headquarters be within a \ntwenty-five-mile radius of the Washington area.51 On 3 November \n1952, Fort Meade on the northern edge of Washington's Beltway \nwas designated the likely new headquarters for NSA under a \nsecret programme entitled 'Project K'. Over the next five years \nthis location would become the headquarters of the world's \nlargest, most expensive and most secretive intelligence agency. 52 \nBritain's GCHQ had made precisely the opposite decision. In \n1952 it moved away from its suburban site at Eastcote on the \nperimeter of London to a comparatively distant location at \nCheltenham in Gloucestershire. Although GCHQ had only \nfinished the move to Eastcote in June 1946, by April 1947 it \nwas already looking for a new home. This was partly because \nof the physical limitations of the Eastcote site, and also because \nTravis realised that in any future war there would not be time \nto relocate to a safe place like Bletchley, away from Soviet \nbombing. Several possibilities were considered, and in October \n1947 GCHQ scouts had found promising twin sites at Oakley \nFarm and Benhall Farm, near Cheltenham, which were occu\u00ad\npied by the Ministry of Pensions. These single-storey tempor\u00ad\nary office complexes had been built in 1940, initially for the \npossible evacuation of government from London during the \nBlitz. After 1942 they were used for the logistical organisation \nof the US Army in Europe. The wartime presence of the \nAmericans was the key, since it had left a helpful legacy of \nimproved trunk cable communications. 53 \nAn alternative explanation for the choice of Cheltenham is \noffered by Professor R.V. Jones, one of the famous architects of \nthe 'Wizard War' which deployed British science against Nazi \nGermany. Jones served as scientific adviser to GCHQ in the early \nUKUSA -CREATING THE GLOBAL SIGINT ALLIANCE 103 \n1950s, and recalls that the scout who initially found the \nCheltenham site was Claude Daubney, one of the senior GCHQ \nstaff who liaised with the Y Units of the armed services, and \nwho spent much of his time in Whitehall. Daubney was a typical \nRAF officer of the thirties, handsome and 'heavily moustached'. \nHis main relaxation was betting on horseraces, and he argued \nendlessly with Jones about the theoretical possibility of beating \nthe bookmakers. He 'deliberately chose Cheltenham, as he told \nme, so that he could combine visits from his London office to \nGCHQ with attendance at Cheltenham races' .54 Others support \nthe idea that GCHQ was attracted to Cheltenham by its prox\u00ad\nimity to the racecourse.55 Whatever the truth of the matter, the \ncourse would serve as an occasional helicopter landing pad for \nfuture visits by British Foreign Secretaries.56 The move from \nEastcote took place between 1952 and 1954, but the rapid \ngrowth of GCHQ during the Korean War meant space was tight \neven at the new location. This contributed to the decision to \nconstitute comsec as a separate organisation called the London \nCommunications Security Agency. Its staff either moved to \ncentral London offices in Palmer Street, or stayed at Eastcote.57 \nIn its move to Cheltenham, GCHQ created a unique intelli\u00ad\ngence town. It brought with it Bletchley Park's formidable repu\u00ad\ntation for secrecy. Within a decade almost everyone in \nCheltenham had a family member or friends who worked at \nGCHQ, but nobody talked about what they did. The town \nwelcomed the 'Foreign Office types' with open arms, and GCHQ \nwas soon contributing an enormous amount to its intellectual \nand artistic life, quite apart from being its biggest employer. \nThe GCHQ staff were also sporty, providing most of the players \nin the Foreign Office football team that won the Civil Service \nFootball Cup in 1952. This could present some peculiar prob\u00ad\nlems. When local reporters covered matches in Cheltenham, \nthey were told they could name the goal-scorers of the visi\u00ad\ntors, but not of the local team. Reporting these games tested \ntheir copywriting skills to the very limit.58 \n* * * \n104 BLETCHLEY PARK AND BEYOND \nThe previous ten years had been a formative decade for GCHQ. \nBy 1944, the code-breakers of Bletchley Park had made them\u00ad\nselves Britain's premier intelligence service. Out of the chaotic \nbrilliance housed in a few wooden huts in the Buckinghamshire \ncountryside came one of Britain's most forward-looking and \ninnovative organisations. Another crucial legacy of the late \n1940s was the agreements with the United States and the \nCommonwealth that laid the foundations of UKUSA, a world\u00ad\nwide sigint alliance, agreements that are still in force today. \nAnxiety about Moscow had been a driving force behind these \nagreements, and even before the Second World War was prop\u00ad\nerly over, the Western allies had been paying increased atten\u00ad\ntion to Soviet cyphers. Despite the triumphs of Venona, and \nthe uncovering of key KGB agents like Klaus Fuchs and Donald \nMaclean, Moscow's higher-level communications remained \nmostly unbreakable after 1948. Accordingly, GCHQ and its \npartners were already searching for new kinds of intelligence\u00ad\ngathering to use against the Soviet Union, opening up a whole \nnew vista in the electronic war. 59 \nTHE 1950s \nFIGHTING THE \nELECTRONIC WAR \n6 \n'Blint' and the Soviet Nuclear Target \nOur intelligence about Soviet development of atomic weapons is \nvery scanty. \nJoint Intelligence Committee, 29 October 19471 \nIn late August 1949, Lavrentii Beria, chief of the KGB, arrived \nat a small settlement on the steppes of Kazakhstan, not far from \nthe city of Semipalatinsk. Here, Soviet scientists were hard at \nwork in a set of temporary laboratories, intently focused on \nwhat they obliquely called 'The Article'. They were referring to \nthe Soviet Union's first atomic bomb, now situated precariously \non top of a scaffolding tower fifty miles away. Houses, loco\u00ad\nmotives, buses and even tanks, together with some unfortunate \nfarm animals, had been placed close to the weapon to gauge \nthe effects of an explosion. The Soviet Union's chief nuclear \nscientist, Igor Kurchatov, gave the command to detonate, and \na small but incredibly bright light appeared at the top of the \ntower. Suddenly it became a white fireball. A blast wave swept \nout, clearing everything in its path, as the explosion itself rapidly \nturned into a chaotic mix of orange, red and black. A dark \nmushroom cloud, five miles high, formed over the test site. \nBack in the laboratories, the scientists were jubilant and kissed \neach other on the foreheads. A month later, nineteen key figures \nfrom the nuclear programme, including a German scientist, were \nmade Heroes of Socialist Labour. Beria is reported to have used \nthe same list of names that identified those who would have \nbeen shot immediately had the test failed.2 \nIn the event, it was Western intelligence that had failed. Soviet \n108 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nprogress towards a nuclear weapon had been a top intelligence \ntarget. The predictions of Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, \nthe highest authority for analysis, had actually become steadily \nless accurate. By 1949, when the test took place, Britain's top \nintelligence analysts were arguing that the probable date of the \nfirst Soviet test would be mid-1953. They were adrift by no less \nthan four years. The CIA was no more accurate, and had simi\u00ad\nlarly told President Truman that mid-1953 was the most likely \ndate. Shocked by the surprise atomic test, Britain and America \nnow redoubled their intelligence effort in the field of Soviet \nstrategic weapons.3 Throughout the Cold War, the key target \nfor GCHQ would remain Soviet nuclear weaponry. This included \nnot only the atomic bomb programme, but work on ballistic \nmissiles, bombers and other means of delivery. The Chiefs of \nStaff were worried by Britain's relative vulnerability to nuclear \nattack, and wanted intelligence forecasts on this crucial issue. \nIn their list of 'sigint targets' for 1948, the JIC exhorted Britain's \ncode-breakers to focus their efforts on this area, together with \nparallel strategic threats such as chemical and biological \nweapons.4 Other Soviet activities, including KGB espionage and \ndiplomatic initiatives, only constituted GCHQ's second and third \npriorities. \nBut ever since the massive revision of Soviet cypher proce\u00ad\ndure on 'Black Friday' in 1948, GCHQ had been having a hard \ntime with its main target. The one-time pads employed for the \nhighest-grade Soviet messages were now being correctly used, \nand so could not be broken, and machine cypher procedure on \nsystems like Taper, effectively a Soviet military version of Enigma, \nhad also been tightened up. Moreover, Moscow and its satel\u00ad\nlites enjoyed common borders and so often used landlines instead \nof wireless transmissions, which could not be easily intercepted. \nAll this eventually prompted the British to follow the Soviets \ndown the path of more extensive physical bugging of diplo\u00ad\nmatic premises in the mid-1950s.5 \nGCHQ was nevertheless providing Whitehall with large quan\u00ad\ntities of useful material on lower-priority issues. It continued its \n'ELINT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 109 \nlong tradition of attacking the communications of smaller states \nlike France, Turkey and Egypt. The JIC had also asked it to look \nat subjects such as Arab nationalism and the relations of Arab \nstates with Britain and the USA, and the attitude of France, \nItaly and the Arab states to the future of North Africa, espe\u00ad\ncially Libya. Because of the ongoing insurgency in Palestine, \nGCHQ was also urged to focus on the Zionist movement, \nincluding its various intelligence services. All of these proved \nmore accessible than Soviet traffic.6 The diplomatic traffic of \nsmaller states also provided an excellent window on the Soviets. \nConversations between Soviet diplomats and the officials of these \ncountries were often captured in telegrams sent from Moscow \nthat could be read with ease. In 1946 Alan Stripp, a British \ncode-breaker who had spent the war working on Japanese \ncodes, found himself redeployed to the Iranian border. \nThroughout the Azerbaijan crisis of that year, when the Soviet \nUnion appeared to be behind a potential breakaway state in \nnorthern Iran, he worked on Iranian and Afghan communica\u00ad\ntions.7 This sigint revealed the scale of Soviet activities and ambi\u00ad\ntions in the region, helping to trigger robust counter-pressure \nby President Truman.8 \nHow the main target lists for sigint were drawn up was of central \nimportance. In theory, they were created by the JIe. However, \nmuch of the preliminary work was undertaken by more shadowy \ncommittees working under the London Signals Intelligence \nBoard, Britain's supreme sigint authority. These enjoyed strong \nmilitary input. When diplomats complained that political and \ncolonial subjects were not getting enough attention, they did \nnot get an enthusiastic response. Many felt that undue weight \nwas being given to defence priorities, and to nuclear warfare in \nparticular. The overwhelming emphasis given to defence had \nprofound implications for the shape of British sigint. It acceler\u00ad\nated the development of a revolutionary new kind of sigint that \nfocused on equipment and military formations.9 \nDuring the Second World War, Bletchley Park's primary \n110 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nemphasis had been the interception of communications signals \nfor intelligence purposes. However, as the war progressed, there \nwas growing interest in another kind of sigint that was derived \nfrom intercepting electronic signals, such as radar, which had \nbeen developed during the Second World War. A related field \nof interest was the growing use of radio waves to create missile \nguidance systems. Examining these enemy radio signals was \nknown as electronic intelligence, or 'elint'. Elint revealed a great \ndeal about enemy weapons, and was also essential for conducting \n'radio warfare', which involved jamming enemy signals and \nradar. The first example of this had been the successful efforts \nof Professor R.V. Jones to divert the beams used to guide the \nGerman bombers attacking London. These techniques were \nrefined during the war against Japan. An elaborate elint unit \nwas set up within Mountbatten's South-East Asia Command \nunder the improbable cover name of the 'Noise Investigation \nBureau'. In the summer of 1945, elint-equipped aircraft called \n'ferrets' patrolled the night skies over Rangoon listening to \nJapanese radar.lo Elint and radio countermeasures, conducted \njointly by GCHQ and special units of the RAF, were a massive \ngrowth area after 1945, partly because they were so closely \nlinked to strategic weapons. One great advantage of elint was \nthat it rarely required the reading of complex enemy codes.11 \nIncreasingly, the business of signals intelligence would consist \nof two branches, the familiar one of communications intelli\u00ad\ngence or 'comint' and the new one of elint. \nBritain had excelled in the use of both comint and elint during \nthe Battle of Britain, and later in bombing raids over Germany. \nOne of the architects of this system was Arthur 'Bill' Bonsall, \nwho would become Director of GCHQ in 1973.12 This success \nhad made a deep impression on American intelligence officers \nin Europe, who felt admiration and not a little envy.13 In early \nFebruary 1945, the US Army Air Force held a conference of all \nsenior air intelligence officers (A-2s) across Europe, at which \n'every A-2 expressed his disappointment at our utter depend\u00ad\nence on the R.A.F: in sigint matters. The US Ninth Air Force \n'ELINT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 111 \nhad deployed some very effective converted Flying Fortresses \nas airborne listening stations, but the British had controlled the \nflow of strategic sigint. The lesson was clear. Colonel Robert D. \nHughes, Director of Intelligence for the Ninth Air Force, told \nWashington that he wanted his own air sigint units with control \nover sigint policy and sigint research: 'We feel that you should \ndemand, and organize under your control, for peace as well as \nwar, an organization similar to that of the R.A.F. ... Unlike other \nhighly technical forms of intelligence, in which our American \nAir Forces have shared, we have continued to depend entirely \non the R.A.F. for this level of work in \"Y\" :14 \nElint formed one of the closest parts of the Anglo-American \nsigint relationship during the immediate post-war period because \nit focused on the Soviet military target. Exchange on elint was \nnot initially linked to the Allied sigint agreements reached at \nthe end of the war, but in 1948 it was being brought within \nthe growing body of Western intelligence pacts that formed \nUKUSA. GCHQ approached Washington with a proposal to \n'extend the present British-US Comint collaboration to include \ncountermeasures, in~ercept activities and intelligence' in the field \nof elint. This meant coordinated patterns of 'ferret' flights -\neffectively a division of labour -with the reSUlting intelligence \nbeing swapped 'via Comint channels'Y By the 1950s, GCHQ \nhad achieved control over elint in Britain, and so was managing \nrelations with all the various American outfits in this field. This \nhad meant redrawing GCHQ's charter to include not only comint \nbut also elint, something which had not pleased everyone. R.V. \nJones, who was Director of Scientific Intelligence at the Ministry \nof Defence in the early 1950s, strongly resented losing this part \nof his empire; the benefits of having all activities superintended \nby GCHQ were nevertheless overwhelming.16 \nAnglo-American sharing was important, because elint was \nan expensive business. Many of the target Soviet signals were \nshort-range and could only be collected from 'ferrets', which \nwere effectively flying intelligence stations. Initially, the RAF \nwas ahead in this new field. By 1947 a fleet of specially equipped \n112 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nLancaster and Lincoln aircraft patrolled the East German border, \nmonitoring Soviet ail\" activity. This was complemented by ground \nstations at locations such as RAF Gatow in Berlin listening to \nbasic low-level Soviet voice traffic. British 'ferrets' made adven\u00ad\nturous forays over the Baltic in June 1948 and the Black Sea \nin September 1948. Remarkably, they were soon crossing Iran \nto reach the Caspian Sea, thus flying perilous missions close to \nthe very heart of the Soviet Union.17 On the ground, a British \nundercover team was also operating in northern Iran, moni\u00ad\ntoring Soviet radar in the Caucasus as well as Soviet missile \ntests at Kasputin Yar on the edge of the Caspian. The team \nconducting this work were posing as archaeologists, a favourite \nBritish cover for all sorts of intelligence work. Once a week they \ndrove from the Iranian border with the Soviet Union to the \nBritish Embassy in Tehran to deliver their precious tapes. IS \nEarly Western elint efforts in the air were spurred on by the \nknowledge that the Soviets had launched their own secret 'ferret' \nprogramme. In April 1948 an American radar station in Germany \nreported that it was being probed by 'ferret' aircraft, and in \nNovember a Soviet plane circled a US radar station at Hokkaido \nin Japan collecting signals for an hour, and then escaped without \ninterception due to bad weather. Defectors also brought tanta\u00ad\nlising snippets. In May 1948 Baclav Cukr, General Secretary of \nthe Czech Air Force Association, escaped to the West bringing \nknowledge of a group of Dakota -like planes at Zote airfield \noutside Prague. These mysterious aircraft were kept under \nconstant guard in special hangars, and had 'several special \nantennae on the outside', a sure sign that they were elint collec\u00ad\ntors.19 \nDuring the war the vested interests of many different RAF \ncommands had made it difficult to create a single coherent elint \norganisation.20 Post-war rationalisation allowed the fusion of \nthese elements. RAF Watton in Norfolk was selected as the new \nhome of elint, and collected the remnants of many wartime \nunits into 100 Countermeasures Group.21 The result was a weird \nmenagerie of aircraft which were one-off flying laboratories \n'EUNT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 113 \nadapted for various special tasks. The mainstays were twenty \nageing Handley Page Halifax bombers. There were also B-17 \nFlying Fortresses, Lancasters, Mosquitoes and Avro Ansons, \ntogether with an Airspeed Oxford and a Percival Proctor. The \nunit at Watton soon received some new Avro Lincolns, effec\u00ad\ntively updated Lancasters. All were stuffed with unique items \nof electronic listening equipment and primitive wire recorders \nfor collecting voice traffic. \nChristened the Central Signals Establishment, or 'CSE', Watton \nboasted a Signals Research Squadron, a dedicated sigint unit \nknown as Monitoring Squadron and a Radio Countermeasures \nSquadron. The Avro Lincolns were the best aircraft available, \nand they were given over to radio countermeasures and radar \njamming, since they would have to work closely with RAF \nbomber formations in any future war with the Soviet Union. \nThe Lincolns would soon be fitted with the revolutionary new \ncarcinotron, or 'backward wave oscillator', in effect an elec\u00ad\ntronic gun that produced powerful microwaves of the same \nfrequencies used by radar, giving them enormous onboard \njamming power. By contrast, some of the other airframes used \nfor listening were antique. However, it was a venerable Halifax \nfrom Monitoring Squadron that was despatched on sigint collect\u00ad\nion duty over the Soviet Zone of Germany during the early \nstages of the Berlin Blockade in 1948. This was the first sign of \na possible 'hot war' between East and West, and GCHQ decided \nit was time to share the lessons of sigint more widely. For the \nfirst time lectures on radio countermeasures and tactical sigint \nwere given to officers passing through the RAF Staff College at \nBracknell. A handbook on tactical sigint was prepared for all \nstaff officers, albeit no mention was made of the mysterious \n'Ultra' .22 \nIn 1951 the monitoring aircraft were rechristened 192 \nSquadron, and worked ever more closely with GCHQ. \nMeanwhile the radio countermeasures and jamming unit was \nrebranded as 199 Squadron. The RAF received four Boeing RB-\n29 'Washington' aircraft, which were really American B-29 \n114 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nSuperfonresses modified for listening. Their vast internal space \nallowed additional sigint equipment to be fitted by the sigint \nground engineers at RAF Watton, who were known as the \nSpecial Radio Installation Flight, or 'SRIF'. In 1953 two English \nElectric Canberras were acquired and refitted for secret sigint \noperations by SRIF. Their standard duty was flights along the \nborders of the Warsaw Pact, alternating with longer visits to the \nBaltic and the Mediterranean. Training of special operators was \nundertaken on slow but reliable Vickers Varsity aircraft. 23 \nBeneath the sea, an even more sensitive sigint programme was \nunder way. Much of what London and Washington knew about \nthe Soviet Navy had been derived from captured German intel\u00ad\nligence material harvested from Berlin in 1945, or from what \nthe British had gleaned directly from their surprisingly good \nrelations with the Soviet Navy during the war. However, this \ninformation was now outdated. The US Navy decided to send \ntwo submarines into the Bering Sea to test the possibility of \nundertaking listening operations off the major Arctic ports used \nby the Soviets. These successful pilot operations were limited \nto an investigation of the area using sonar. A much more ambi\u00ad\ntious mission was then attempted. This was a proper sigint \ncollection operation, designed to scoop the signals that emanated \nfrom regular Soviet missile tests in the Barents Sea.24 \nIn the summer of 1949 the US Navy picked its latest \nsubmarines for this mission, the USS Cochino and the USS Tusk. \nThey had been built at the end of the war, and in 1948 they \nwere modified to bring them up to U-boat standards and fitted \nwith the latest snorkels. This allowed them to run submerged \nfor long periods on diesel power, venting their exhaust to the \nsurface. They had also been streamlined and fitted with the \nfastest available propulsion systems. The specialist elint equip\u00ad\nment for capturing missile control signals, or 'telemetry', was \ninstalled by British sigint technicians at Portsmouth. The sub\u00ad\nmarine chosen for fitting was the Cochino, under Commander \nRafael Benitez. The name 'Cochino' was supposed to denote a \n'EUNT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 115 \nspecies of trigger fish, but in Spanish it simply meant 'The Pig'. \nPreparations were masterminded by Harris M. Austin from the \nUS Naval Security Group and civilian sigint engineers. Additional \naerials, known as 'ears', were fitted to the tailfin. The elaborate \nlistening technology required the drilling of small holes for wires \nin the submarine's pressure hull, which weakened it and did \nnot best please the crew. Trials were held along the British coast \nin July 1949. In August the Cochino, escorted by three other \nsubmarines, including the Tusk, headed for Arctic waters. In the \nBarents Sea, the Cochina separated and sat off the coast hoping \nto collect the high-frequency signals that indicated a missile test, \nbut found nothing of great interest. After a few days of lurking, \nit headed back to a rendezvous with the Tusk.25 \nHowever, disaster now struck. Four hundred miles north of \nthe Arctic Circle the Cachino ran into a severe storm. Water \npoured in through a malfunctioning snorkel and a serious battery \nfire developed, burning for fourteen hours and producing large \nvolumes of dangerous hydrogen. Some of the crew battled the \nfire using breathing equipment, but after a series of explosions \nthey staggered back and admitted defeat. One crew member \nrecalls: 'They formed a grotesque aspect with their faces and \nhair burned. The skin was falling from their hands. '26 \nCommander Benitez and his seventy-eight crew decided to \nabandon ship just after midnight. Despite a rescue by the Tusk, \nseven men were lost to the stormy seas off the Norwegian coast. \nSix of these fatalities were brave rescuers from the Tusk who \nwere equipped with faulty survival suits, while the seventh was \ncivilian signals intelligence expert Robert W. Philo from the \nCochino. Commander Benitez was the last man to make the \ntreacherous crossing -effected by a swaying plank -between \nthe two vessels. By the time the Tusk pulled clear the Cochino \nwas already half-submerged. 'With a final burst of spray she \ndisappeared from sight: plunging into 950 feet of water. The \nTusk took the casualties, many with severe burns, to Hammerfest \nin Norway, from where they were flown to London.27 These \nwere the first casualties in one of the most secretive and \n1 16 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ndangerous areas of Cold War signals intelligence activity. \nHowever, London and Washington were not deterred. By the \nearly 1950s, British and American sigint submarines were regular \nvisitors to the headquarters of the Soviet fleet.28 \nElint flights over the open sea were also sensitive and risky. \nOn 8 April 1950 a US Navy elint aircraft, a PBY-42 Privateer, \nlaunched from Bremerhaven in northern Germany, was shot \ndown while trying to identify new Soviet missile bases along \nthe Baltic coast. The crew of four, who had named their aircraft \nthe Turbulent Turtle, all perished. The Soviets later salvaged the \nPrivateer's elint equipment from the waters of the Baltic, and \nwere in no doubt about the nature of the mission. Further \nmissions were postponed.29 Within a month of the shootdown \nof the Privateer, General Omar Bradley, then Chairman of the \nUS Joint Chiefs of Staff, set out the case for resuming the flights, \ninsisting that the intelligence they gathered was of the 'utmost \nimportance'. President Truman finally agreed to a resumption \nwhen told that US aircraft close to Soviet-controlled territory \nwould be armed' and instructed to shoot in self -defense'. Truman \nminuted, 'Good sense, it seems to me: The President's green \nlight was received on 6 June 1950, but after the outbreak of \nthe Korean War later that month the flights were suspended \nfor another few weeks due to 'current hyper-tension and fear \nof further shoot-downs'. By the end of 1950, regular operations \nwith RB-50Gs, 'special mission' elint aircraft adapted from an \nupgraded Superfortress bomber, were operating out of RAF \nLakenheath airbase in East Anglia.30 \nNorway was an early partner in all types of sigint operations. \nIn 1952, Rear Admiral Anthony Buzzard, Britain's Director of \nNaval Intelligence, paid a secretive visit to Norway. His requests \nwere so sensitive that only handwritten notes were taken at \nthe meetings. Buzzard asked for permission to launch special \nreconnaissance flights from Norway into Russian airspace using \nthe RAP's new Canberra aircraft, and also to run elint flights \nconducted within Norwegian airspace. However, the fate of the \nUSS Cochino and then of the American Privateer had alerted the \n'EUNT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 117 \nNorwegians to elint operations as a potential flashpoint, and \nthey were cautious. Only permission for the latter flights within \nNorwegian airspace was granted.31 By the mid-1950s the \nNorwegian Defence In1:elligence Staff was beginning to experi\u00ad\nment with the use of commercial trawlers as platforms for intel\u00ad\nligence-gathering in the Barents Sea. Initially these were used \nfor photographic reconnaissance, but they were gradually \nexpanded to involve sigint monitoring. A 'cover' shipping \ncompany, Egerfangst, was established to run these operations, \nand its first vessel, the Eger, was in operation by 1956 using \nequipment supplied by the American NSA.32 \nAlthough the most important sigint collected at short range came \nthrough perilous operations by air and sea, the British and \nAmericans also boasted vast armies of land-based listeners \ncrouching over their radio sets in wooden huts, often in inhos\u00ad\npitable locations. Tactical sigint in peacetime presented a problem, \nsince there was not much for Y service sigint to listen to. Yet on \nthe first day of any future war with Russia -and war, if it came, \nwas expected to CJme suddenly -the RAF would be required \nto reconstitute its vast legions of secret listeners.33 In the event, \nthe three services kept a large inter-service intercept formation \nin place, using personnel who were doing National Service. \nDuring peacetime they were lent to GCHQ, and spent much of \ntheir time collecting a wide range of signals, including diplo\u00ad\nmatic and commercial traffic. One RAF sigint officer observed, \n'Our only function is to receive the stuff in its cryptic form - a \npurely mechanical process -and pass it on to the body whose \njob it is to break it down.'34 By 1950 a system was in place \nwhereby all those beginning National Service were asked if they \nwould volunteer to learn Russian. The huge numbers of \npersonnel who were trained up guaranteed a vast pool of tactical \nsigint operators who could be recalled on the eve of war, although \nGCHQ worried about how to hide the scale of the operation. \nThis had profound consequences for the balance of power within \npost-war British sigint. It ensured that while the overall British \nlIB FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nslgmt p!ogramme was coordinated by GCHQ, it was in fact \nprovided by a complex alliance of GCHQ and the three armed \nservices. This secret pact suited everyone -except for the Treasury, \nwhich struggled to track sigint spending, hidden as it was under \na welter of misleading headings and cover organisations.35 \nThe outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 triggered \na massive expansion of the riskier and more dangerous short\u00ad\nrange operations to collect all types of sigint, including elint. \nTensions were high, because the strategic planners believed that \nthe outbreak of global war was not far away. Hitherto the \nAmericans had been dependent on the British to cover much \nof north-west Europe, but now Americans began to arrive in \nnumbers and their listening stations sprouted all over Britain, \noften disguised as RAF stations. In 1952 the 47th Radio Squadron \nof the US Air Force Security Service arrived at Kirknewton \nairbase in Scotland, from where it could monitor shipping off \nthe Kola Peninsula. In October that year Squadron Leader J.R. \nMitchell became the first dedicated 'Liaison Officer for GCHQ' \non elint in Washington. 36 \nThe accelerated pace of operations paid dividends. By 1952 \nelint experts in London and Washington had achieved a compre\u00ad\nhensive picture of the Soviet Air Force. This had not required \nthe breaking of Soviet codes. Instead, most of it was achieved \nthrough a mixture of elint or direction-finding, which simply \nmeant using triangulation to locate specific Soviet units. GCHQ \nalso listened in on clear voice traffic used by Soviet air-defence \ncontrollers giving instructions to fighters. There were large gaps \nin both Soviet air warning and coastal radar, which were mapped \ncarefully. Anti -aircraft radar around Moscow was examined with \nspecial attention. Elint experts had been able to follow air\u00ad\ndefence exercises in which the Soviets had used tiny strips of \naluminium foil dropped from aircraft, known as 'chaff', as a \nradio countermeasure to fool radar operators into thinking large \nnumbers of aircraft were airborne. Some of the more sophisti\u00ad\ncated Soviet work was thought to have been carried out by \nGerman experts captured by the Russians after 1945. Korea \n'EUNT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 119 \nitself had proved to be a bonanza, with new Soviet radio equip\u00ad\nment being captured, including direction-finding equipment \nwhich showed 'marked improvement in design and construc\u00ad\ntion'.37 \nSuccess in the exciting new field of elint offset some recent \ndisappointments. GCHQ and its American partners had not yet \nrecovered the medium-grade Soviet cyphers lost during the infa\u00ad\nmous 'Black Friday' of October 1948. They had not detected \nthe advent of the first Soviet atom bomb, nor had they antici\u00ad\npated the outbreak of the Korean War. However, the elint effort \nagainst the Soviet Air Force, which also involved direction\u00ad\nfinding and traffic analysis, was one of the key areas in which \nGCHQ could claim outstanding achievement in the first post\u00ad\nwar decade -and it was sustained. \nThere was an especially secret reason why GCHQ and NSA \nexamined the operational anatomy of the Soviet 'nuclear bear' \nso minutely. During the early 1950s, target intelligence officers \nin London and Washington had been busy exchanging sensi\u00ad\ntive data on 'the mission of blunting the Russian atomic offen\u00ad\nsive'. This meant planning early counter-force attacks against \nSoviet nuclear forces, especially bombers, in the hope of \ndestroying them on the ground in Eastern Europe before they \ncould be used in a future war. GCHQ had given particular atten\u00ad\ntion to this matter because of the vulnerability of Britain, and \nthe Americans were impressed by the progress London had \nmade on it. GCHQ and the RAP's secret units had amassed 'a \nsignificant amount of evaluated intelligence, particularly in the \nspecial intelligence field, which would be of the greatest value' \nif war broke out.38 \nAmerican officers considered that 'vigorous efforts should be \ntaken immediately to ensure rapid development of a joint \nresearch program to insure maximum exploitation of the British \nresources'. In short, it was not just the raw elint that the British \nhad collected, but their sophisticated analysis of it that allowed \nit to be turned into high -quality finished intelligence, a legacy \nof the skills garnered during Bletchley Park's Hut Three operation. \n120 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nMost of the airfields and the operational procedures for the \nSoviet Union's nuclear air force in the European theatre had \nbeen mapped by 1952.39 In June of that year a team from the \nUS Air Force Security Service centre at Brooks Field, led by \nMajor Hill, visited GCHQ and one of its outstations at Knockholt \nin Kent to further converge their activities in this area. Hill also \nwanted to discuss the creation of new 'ground-based electronic \nintercept stations' in Europe. Korea had greatly accelerated \npreparations for a 'hot war', and GCHQ's elint success on Soviet \nair defences helped it to justify budget increases.4o \nThroughout 1951 and 1952, global war often seemed immi\u00ad\nnent. Communist China had entered the Korean War in 195 L \nand numerous Soviet advisers were busy assisting the North \nKorean forces. Soviet and American pilots were actually fighting \neach other in the skies of East Asia. Although the public were \nnever told, sigint made this fact clear to the secret listeners. In \nthis increasingly fevered atmosphere, improved intelligence was \ngiven a high priority. On 22 January 1952 the British Chiefs \nof Staff met the Permanent Under-Secretary of the Foreign \nOffice to review plans for accelerating intelligence. GCHQ was \ngiven a large tranche of new money over five years under the \nheading 'Methods to Improve'. Its extensive shopping list \nincluded larger computers and 'high speed analytical equip\u00ad\nment' for renewed attacks on high-grade Soviet communica\u00ad\ntions. These were given the highest priority, and government \nresearch and supply elements were instructed accordingly. \nGCHQ and the Admiralty were beginning a new programme \nto build better receivers for ground-based and seaborne \n'Technical Search Operations' which were critical to elint. Again, \nmuch of this was about targeting, and the Chiefs of Staff contin\u00ad\nually reiterated the 'very great importance' of speeding up tech\u00ad\nnical development in these areas.4! By November 1952, British \ndefence chiefs wanted increased expenditure on intelligence, \nand were unanimous that in the short term the emphasis should \nbe on sigint.42 \nLate 1952 was an exciting time for GCHQ. Equipped with a \n'ELINT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 121 \nlarger budget, staff had begun to move to their new head\u00ad\nquarters at the twin sites in Cheltenham. It also had a new \nDirector, Wing Commander Eric Jones. Given the rise of airborne \nsigint, it was appropriate that an RAF officer should have \nsucceeded Edward Travis, who had been increasingly ill during \nthe late 1940s with lumbagoY Jones was a Bletchley Park \nveteran who had proved himself while in charge of the criti\u00ad\ncally important Hut Three. Bill Millward, another long-serving \nGCHQ veteran, recalls that at first glance 'his qualifications for \nthe post were not apparent'. He had spent the 1930s as a cloth \nmerchant in Macclesfield. However, he was a quick learner, a \nnatural diplomat and a man of obvious principle.44 He had proved \nan excellent liaison officer in Washington towards the end of \nthe war, and after the 'happy outcome' of the BRUSA confer\u00ad\nence of 1946 he had decided to 'stay in the racket' .45 This was \ngood for GCHQ, since Jones proved to be a leader who inspired \ninstinctive trust. In late 1952 he was busy filling the three \nhundred extra staff posts recently authorised. GCHQ had already \nproposed an additional increment of a further 366 staff, and \nwas going from strength to strength.46 \nIn the late summer and the autumn of 1952, senior GCHQ \nofficers like John Somerville had been pressing defence scien\u00ad\ntists and intelligence chiefs to join them in planning the future \nexpansion of airborne sigint.47 Good results were being obtained, \nand GCHQ was making the most of the facilities at its disposal, \nbut there were just not enough 'ferret' flights, and the e1int\u00ad\ncollection effort needed 'more equipment, personnel, aircraft \nand ships'.48 The RAF was using its three RB-29 Washingtons, \nwhich were big enough for the increasingly complex equipment \nrequired.49 It was a Washington that had captured the first \nrecordings of 'Scan Odd', the new airborne radar which equipped \nSoviet fighters. However, the RAF's Washingtons were slow and \nvulnerable compared to the upgraded American variant, which \ncould reach 400 mph, as fast as a wartime fighter. 50 British e1int \nspecialists longed to enter the jet age with the military version \nof the de Havilland Comet, but there seemed to be no hope of \n122 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ngetting this desirable aircraft. Part of the problem was that 192 \nSquadron was not seen as a front-line fighting unit, tended to \nbe overlooked and was continually moved between commands \nover the next two decades.51 There was also an acute shortage \nof staff at GCHQ qualified in the rarefied field of elint analysis, \nwhich was made worse by the upheaval of the move to \nCheltenham. 52 \nThe required extra momentum came from the Americans. \nWashington pressed the British for more spending and more \neffort at a major US/UK elint conference in December 1952.53 \nAccordingly, in 1953, Britain's elint specialists acquired more \nsmall specialist Canberra. jet aircraft, and a year later, after much \ndiscussion, the Treasury reluctantly approved the purchase of \nthree much-prized de Havilland Comet C2s, a modified version \nof Britain's first jet airliner. Until now, all of the sigint aircraft \nhad been rough-and-ready adaptations. The Comet C2 was \nBritain's first dedicated airborne sigint platform designed from \nscratch. In the spring of 1957 the first C2 arrived at CSE Watton \nand was placed in the hands of SRIF, the RAF's secret team of \nsigint engineers, vvho were based in No.3 Hangar. Their task \nwas to cram a whole mini -sigint ground station into the cramped \ninterior of an airliner. For George Baillie, the Principal Scientific \nOfficer at Watton, this was the most complex task his team \nwould ever undenake. Equipping the three Comets was \nextremely expensive and time-consuming. It was therefore with \ncomplete horror that they discovered a fire in No.4 Hangar in \nthe early hours of the morning of 3 June 1959. One plane was \ncompletely destroyed, leaving CSE with only two Comets to \nfulfil the many missions requested by GCHQ. The Treasury \nboggled at the cost of the unscheduled replacement of the third \naircraft, and it was two years before GCHQ's Deputy Director \nJoe Hooper persuaded it to find the money. 54 \nIn America, the new NSA was now responsible for commu\u00ad\nnications intelligence or 'comint', the most important area of \nsignals collection and code-breaking. However, battles over elint \nstretched on into the 1960s. Even ten years after the creation of \n'EUNT' AND THE SOVIET NUCLEAR TARGET 123 \nNSA, American officials envied the more centralised British model, \nwhich placed GCHQ ill charge of both fields of sigint activity. 55 \nIn 1953 the British approached the Americans to suggest a \ncombined organisation for planning electronic warfare and radio \ncountermeasures. The problem for the Americans was that they \nwould first have to settle their bitter inter-service disputes, which \nwas proving near impossible.56 Notwithstanding this, the two \nnations managed to get together for a major US/UK Electronic \nWarfare Conference every two years.57 The GCHQ approach made \nsense, because it was becoming harder to distinguish between \nsignals that carried communications and other types of electronic \nsignals. The Americans noted wistfully that this 'has been recog\u00ad\nnised by the British, who have placed all electronic search and \nreconnaissance under the control of COMINT authorities' -in \nother words, under GCHQ. In the US, control over these matters \nremained fiercely contested as late as the Vietnam War.58 \nBy 1953, elint was considered so valuable that more aggres\u00ad\nsive British operations were being authorised. These included \nclandestine operations on the ground. GCHQ had manufactured \na new short-range elint reception and analysis kit, code-named \n'Deaf Aid', that looked like a suitcase. SIS was sending agents \ninto the Eastern Bloc with these sets -the results are still clas\u00ad\nsified. The Joint Intelligence Committee decided that the equip\u00ad\nment would also be secretly deployed in diplomatic posts inside \nthe Eastern Bloc alongside the covert comint stations operated \nby the Diplomatic Wireless Service.59 By February 1954 exper\u00ad\nimental versions were also being deployed on the ground by \nthe British Military Mission, or 'Brixmis', effectively a team of \nroving military attaches in East Germany.60 GCHQ was settled \ninto its new accommodation by January 1954, allowing it to \nwork with the Ministry of Defence's Directorate of Scientific \nIntelligence on the much-needed expansion of T Division, the \nanalytical unit at Cheltenham which made sense of elint once \nit was collected.61 \nAll these new intelligence activities meant risk. In October \n1952 A.V. Alexander, the Defence Secretary, and Anthony Eden, \n124 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nthe Foreign Secretary, had been chewing over the delicate ques\u00ad\ntion of who should approve the expanding programme of 'ferret' \nflights and perilous submarine missions around the edge of the \nSoviet Union. They agreed that the buck should be passed \nupwards to Downing Street, and a process developed whereby \na list of proposed secret sigint missions was regularly sent to \nPrime Minister Winston Churchill. Rather disingenuously, \nAlexander told Churchill that Britain had in the past, in coop\u00ad\neration with the Americans, 'carried out one or two flights with \nspecial aircraft near Soviet territory with the intention of \n\"sniffing\" at RUSSIan transmissions'. In reality, a veritable fleet \nof elint aircraft had been buzzing around the perimeter of the \nSoviet Union for more than five years. Churchill was assured \nthat they kept at least thirty miles from the Soviet coastline. \nAlexander continued: \n* The aircraft are almost certain to be picked up by Russian \nradar. In fact we shall be disappointed if they are not, for \nthat is the whole object of the operations. But since the \nflights will take place at the darkest period of the month, \nand the Russians do not (as far as we know) possess airborne \nradar, the risks of actual interception are small. \n* In other words, if the intelligence operations against Soviet air \ndefences were to succeed, they had to actually create alerts and \nprompt the Soviets to launch their fighters, as it was precisely \nthese procedures that GCHQ wanted to listen in to. Alexander \nadded that a key purpose in undertaking these operations was \n'making our own contribution to the Anglo-American intelli\u00ad\ngence pool from which we will expect valuable returns in kind'.62 \nWhat would happen if a secret British spy plane crashed inside \nthe Soviet Union, or if a submarine was caught inside a Soviet \nharbour? So far the GCHQ's clandestine collection programmes \nhad been remarkably free of incidents, but this enviable record \nwas not to last for much longer.63 \n7 \nThe Voyages of HMS Turpin \nDepth charging continued for longer than I care to re\u00ad\nmember ... \nTony Beasley, HMS Turpin, off the Soviet coast, \nMarch 19551 \nBy early 1953 the Americans had lost a submarine and an \naircraft during perilous short-range sigint missions. Their human \nlosses were already in double figures. By contrast, the British \nwere increasingly confident, having flown many missions \nwithout incident. The lumbering RB-29 Washington aircraft of \nthe RAF's 192 Squadron regularly flew their routes around the \nBaltic, and were often 'intercepted' by Soviet fighters, but were \nnever fired upon. This may have been because the British used \na small number of experienced and specialised units for forward \nsigint collection who were dedicated to covert missions, working \nunder the direction of GCHQ. Equally it could have been sheer \ngood luck. However, in 1953 that luck was to change. \nThe first serious British 'flap' was the loss of an RAF Avro \nLincoln on 12 March 1953. The Lincoln was effectively an \nimproved version of the Lancaster bomber that had entered \nservice just as the Second World War ended. It saw active service \nagainst insurgents in Malaya and Kenya during the 1950s, and \nalthough it remained Britain's heavy bomber until the arrival \nof the first V-bombers in 1955, a number were transferred to \nintelligence duties. Some were allocated to 199 Squadron, the \nradio warfare unit that operated out of RAF Watton. Armed \nwith a powerful carcinotron, they were capable of a formidable \nbarrage of jamming, and were often called on to disrupt the \n126 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nsigint-gathering activities of Soviet spy trawlers around the coast \nof Britain.2 The RAF also boasted a Radar Reconnaissance Flight \nof Lincolns that took 'radar pictures' of important landmarks \ndenoting routes to ke~' bombing targets. Some of the more \nprecarious Anglo-American overflights of the Soviet Union \nduring 1952 and 1954 were effectively engaged in an intelli\u00ad\ngence-mapping exercise for bombing missions that might be \ndirected against Moscow and Kiev. 3 \nThe RAF Lincoln lost on 12 March 1953 was not directly \ninvolved in radio warfare or special duties. It was merely on exer\u00ad\ncise, and wandered out of one of the defined twenty-mile air \ncorridors over the Soviet Zone between West Germany and Berlin. \nHowever, as we have seen, British and American exercises were \noften designed to trigger an alert so that Soviet air-defence systems \ncould be listened in on. The frequent efforts to get their defences \nto 'light up' ensured that the Soviets were often on high alert, \nand were inclined to fire at anything that came into their terri\u00ad\ntory. Accordingly, all RAF flying near the Soviet Zone of Germany \ninvolved an element of risk. This was underlined by a Polish pilot \nwho chose to defect to the West on 5 March 1953, and landed \nhis Soviet-built MiG-IS jet fighter in Denmark. He confirmed \nthat MiG pilots were 'under orders to shoot down an aircraft if \nit refuses to obey signals to land, even if it does not open fire'.4 \nOn the morning of 12 March 1953, two Lincolns took off \nfrom the Central Gunnery School at Leconfield in Yorkshire. \nThis was a routine training flight that involved an exercise with \nNATO partners and took place every fortnight, heading out over \nGermany on a simulated mission of about six hours. The first \naircraft, 'H' (RF503), was under the command of Flight Sergeant \nDenham, and carried the Director of the Gunnery School, \nSquadron Leader Frank Doran. En route to Germany, as part \nof the exercise, Denham's aircraft was 'intercepted' by \nThunderjets of the Dutch Air Force, Belgian Meteors and RAF \nVampires. Unusually, as they approached Kassel, still well inside \nthe British Zone, they were surprised to see two Soviet MiG\u00ad\nISs underneath them. The MiGs conducted a number of mock \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 127 \nattacks, but did not open fire. Their activity was recorded on \nthe cine cameras that were attached to the gun turrets of the \nLincoln for training purposes. The anxious crew turned north \nand then headed back to their base in Yorkshire. \nThe second Lincoln, 'C' (RFS3I), under the command of Flight \nSergeant Peter Dunnell, was following along the same track, \ntwo hours behind. It also carried an important passenger, \nSquadron Leader Harold Fitz, who had just taken over as \nCommanding Officer of 3 Squadron and who had come along \nfor the ride as co-pilot. Just after I p.m., near the air corridor \nthat stretched across the Soviet Zone from Hamburg to Berlin, \ntwo more MiG-ISs appeared. This time they opened fire. \nAlthough the Lincoln had strayed some way into the Soviet \nZone, by the time it was fired on the crew had realised their \nerror and retraced their steps. They were now just west of the \nRiver Elbe, inside the British Zone. The firing took place over \nthe village of Bleckede, where ammunition belts from the MiGs \nwere later recovered. The Lincoln entered a steep dive, still \npursued by the MiGs, and broke up, with the main fuselage \nlanding in a wood near Boizenburg, just inside the Soviet Zone \non the eastern bank of the Elbe. Other parts of the aircraft, \nincluding the starboard wing, came down on Luneburg Heath, \na British military exercise area fifteen miles south of Hamburg.s \nOf the seven crew, four were found dead inside the wreckage. \nThree of the crew had managed to bail out, but one parachute \nfailed to open. The other two crew members seemed to para\u00ad\nchute successfully, but several shocked German witnesses testi\u00ad\nfied that one of the Soviet MiGs swooped low and strafed them \nwith cannon fire. Wilma Muller, one of the witnesses, testified \nthat one of the crew had a 'perforated parachute' as a result of \nbeing fired upon. Both crew members whose parachutes had \nopened died of terrible wounds shortly after landing.6 \nThe RAF concluded that the Lincoln had gone off course \nand strayed into Soviet airspace shortly after it entered the \nair corridor to Berlin. However, it was obvious that its inten\u00ad\ntion was to head up one of the three twenty-mile-wide air \n128 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ncorridors that connected the three sectors of Germany occu\u00ad\npied by the West to Berlin. While the Soviets insisted that \nthe British crew had fired first, it was soon proved beyond \ndoubt that the Lincoln had been unarmed, since much of the \nfiring mechanism from its turret guns was routinely removed \non training sorties. However, the Foreign Office resisted the \nidea of pressing hard for compensation because inspection of \nthe wreckage showed that the Lincoln was actually carrying \nsome ammunition, even though it was unlikely that it had \nfired. 'We might have to admit that the aircraft accidentally \npenetrated the Soviet Zone of Germany,' it noted. \nNevertheless, it was confident that, from where the cases \nfrom the Soviet cannon shells fell, the MiGs had downed the \nLincoln over the British Zone.7 \nBritish Members of Parliament were outraged. They pressed \nfor compensation from the Soviets for the crew's families, and \nwere told by the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Selwyn \nLloyd, that the British High Commissioner in Germany had been \nordered to 'demand' adequate payment. Churchill was dearly \nanimated about the matter, but behind the scenes officials were \nsoft-pedalling.8 High-level instructions were given to British \nrepresentatives to 'avoid post-mortems', and instead to focus \non talks that would avoid a repetition of the incident.9 Three \nmonths after the event, Foreign Office officials urged, 'We should \nbe in no hurry to do anything: and were anxious to prevent \nthe public from learning that the Soviets had refused compen\u00ad\nsation from the outset. 10 The bodies of the seven crew members \nwho had fallen in the Soviet Zone were returned to RAF CelIe, \nand eventually to their families. II \nWhile the Lincoln had not been on an intelligence flight, its \nprogress was being carefully tracked by a British sigint unit on \nthe ground at RAF Scharfoldendorf in the British Zone of \nGermany. The unit carefully transcribed the conversation between \nthe MiG pilots and the Soviet ground controllers, which were 'in \ndear' voice communications. This sigint report was soon on the \ndesk of the Prime Minister, and the unit received praise for \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 129 \ncatching the Soviets 'red-handed'. The report made it clear that \nthe Lincoln was shot down in cold blood, and led to Churchill's \nbitter comments on the 'wanton attack' in the House of \nCommons.12 It also helped to confirm that before turning around \nand retracing its steps, the Lincoln had in fact penetrated Soviet \nairspace 'fairly deeply'. 13 Later, the families of the crew members \nasked why Churchill was so certain about the exact pattern of \nevents, but of course the sigint aspect of his information could \nnot be revealed to them.14 Churchill ordered that in future all \nflights over Germany, including training flights, would not only \ncarry ammunition but would also fly with guns 'loaded and \ncocked'. In 1955 his successor, Anthony Eden, still required all \ntraining aircraft to carry ammunition when over Germany.15 \nAn agreement with the Soviets on air incidents was badly needed. \nAs air historians have noted, the first half of 1953 was a period \nof high tension in Western Europe. Only a few days before the \nLincoln incident, an American F-84 Thunderjet had been shot \ndown by a MiG. A week later a British European Airways Viking \nairliner was strafed by MiGs while travelling down the Berlin \nAir Corridor, but managed to limp home. A fortnight after that \nan American bomber was attacked by MiG-ISs over Germany, \nbut repelled them with vigorous cannon fire. In the Far East, \nwhere the Korean War was drawing to a close, things were even \nworse. On 27 July, a few hours before the final armistice came \ninto effect, an American F-86F Sabre pilot shot down a civilian \nAeroflot Il-12 airliner, killing all twenty-one persons on board. \nThe Americans and the Soviets engaged in a protracted argu\u00ad\nment as to whether the airliner was over North Korea or China \nwhen it was shot down. No one could disguise the fact that the \ndebris came down in China.16 Two days later, presumably in \nretaliation, the Soviets downed a US Air Force RB-50G \nSuperfortress sigint reconnaissance aircraft near Vladivostok, with \nthe loss of seventeen of the eighteen crewP The RB-50G was a \nmuch faster version of the RB-29 Washingtons flown by the \nRAP's 192 Squadron, but it had still not been able to escape. All \n130 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nNATO aircraft flying near the Inner German Border were now \noperating on a fully-armed 'fire back' basis.18 \nDiscussions between the four occupying powers over the RAF \nLincoln did not go well. In 1945 the Allies had agreed that there \nwould be three air corridors stretching from different points in \nthe Western Zones of Germany across the Soviet Zone to Berlin, \nwhich was itself divided between the four powers. Sensibly, the \nSoviets suggested replacing the complex and confusing system \nof three different air corridors with a single wider corridor or \n'funnel'. The Allies refused, because although this solution would \nhave been safer, each of the three corridors passed over a subject \nof 'intelligence interest'. Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, who represented \nthe British, explained to officials in London: \n* The crux of the matter is really how much importance we \nattach to the intelligence interest. The Americans are at \npresent very strong on this (they are particularly anxious \nto retain ability to watch the Fulda Gap), and have suggested \nto us privately that we are not attaching sufficient impor\u00ad\ntance to intelligence interest in the Northern Corridor. \n* Negotiations were made more complex by the fact that the \nFrench, who also had a sector in Berlin, were 'obviously' not \ntold about the intelligence issues during the negotiations.19 \nThe Americans later explained that the retention of the \nsouthern corridor was 'an absolutely vital requirement' for \nthem, since what they needed above all was early warning \nof any concentration of forces signalling an impending Soviet \nattack. As well as the regular sigint flights that travelled down \nthe corridors, the Americans were now using special aircraft \nequipped for lateral photography, claiming that the photo\u00ad\ngraphs were so good you could 'see a golf ball on a tee at 40 \nmiles'.20 The Americans were 'entirely rigid' on intelligence \ninterests being paramount. Accordingly, the negotiations \nfoundered, and the existing system, with its three corridors, \nremained largely unchanged.21 \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 131 \nThe RAF sigint units based at CSE Watton were especially \nlucky not to lose any aircraft in this mini air-war. In 1954 a \nGloster Meteor from 527 Squadron, which claimed to be on a \n'radio calibration missic'll', strayed over the border into East \nGermany. This seems to have been due to a navigational error. \nThe crew were oblivious to their mistake, but soon realised they \nwere running short of fueL and opted to land at the next visible \nairfield. The pilot, Sergeant Don Coleman, and his navigator, \nSergeant Mike Thomson, stepped out onto the tarmac and -to \ntheir horror -realised that the approaching troops had red stars \non their caps. The Soviets spent several weeks inspecting the \naircraft before it was returned to the RAE The incident earned \nColeman the unwelcome nickname 'Dan Dare'. \nThe following year, another Gloster Meteor on a 'radio cali\u00ad\nbration flight' from Watton arrived unannounced in East \nGermany. Again the pilots had run out fuel, but this time they \ncould not find a runway, and opted for a belly landing in a \nfield. After a suitable delay for technical inspection of the radio \nwarfare equipment on board, the Meteor was again returned \nby the Soviets. On the night of 26 June 1955 there was a much \nmore serious incident when a radio countermeasures Lincoln \n(WD 132) from 199 Squadron exercising over West Germany \ncollided with a USAF F-86D Sabre jet fighter. The Lincoln crashed \nseven miles north of Bitburg, and all the crew were 10st.22 \nEarly incidents like these mostly occurred in northern Europe. \nHowever, Turkey and the Black Sea were also of enormous \nintelligence importance because of the presence of rocket\u00ad\ntesting sites in the southern Soviet Union around the Caucasus. \nAs early as September 1950, Britain's Technical Radio \nInterception Committee was directing a series of flights against \nSoviet radar targets on the Black Sea.23 The sought-after prize \nwas elint from Soviet guided missiles being tested at Kapustin \nYar. In 1954, trials had been held in Turkey to see if ground \nstations could intercept the signals, but the equipment was \nnot sensitive enough, and in any case it was hard to collect \n132 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nsignals during the early stages of rocket flight, since they were \nblocked by hills near the launch site. The only option was to \nget closer to the take-off sites and to monitor from altitude, \nwhich meant flights over the Black Sea or the Caspian Sea. \nThe most desperate option was perilous missions by SIS's \nTechnical Collection Service, with human spies furnished with \nspecially equipped suitcases, rather like the suitcase radios \ncarried by wartime resistance workers, which were something \nof a liability, since close inspection would have revealed their \ntrue purpose.24 This was the unit that also specialised in gath\u00ad\nering intelligence on the Soviet atomic programme.25 \nThe nearest miss probably occurred in 1955, when the RAP's \n192 Squadron identified the first MiG-15 with airborne radar by \nflying directly at the Soviet border in an area near the Caspian \nSea. However, the slow-flying RB-29 Washington only narrowly \nescaped being shot down, and returned peppered with holes. \nThe Squadron Commander, Group Captain Norman Hoad, was \nawarded an Air Force Cross for the discovery of this new Soviet \nairborne radar.26 Was the risk worth it? As a result of this inci\u00ad\ndent, in mid-December 1955 some members of the Joint \nIntelligence Committee began to challenge the remorseless collec\u00ad\ntion of elint on Soviet air-defence capabilities. To some it seemed \nboth expensive and dangerous. However, Eric Jones, the Director \nof GCHQ, argued that in the realm of sigint it was possible neither \nto dart about from one subject to another, nor to concentrate \non one only. He reminded them that it was the extremely thor\u00ad\nough, if tedious, collection of 'order of battle' intelligence that \nhad allowed them to pick up specialist guided weapons activity \nthat was of extreme interest to all three services, revealing new \nSoviet missile developments. While this was true, one might \nargue that Jones was bound to defend 'order of battle' activity \nfor institutional reasons. Struggling against high-grade Soviet \ncyphers that could not be broken, this was the best product he \ncould squeeze out from the other available electronic sources. \nMoreover, it reflected GCHQ's secret deal with the armed ser\u00ad\nvices, which wanted sigint to have a strong focus on assisting \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 133 \nmilitary operations. The RAF shared the costs of airborne collec\u00ad\ntion, and as Jones remarked, more than half of GCHQ's work \nwas now in support of defence activity. 27 \nBritain's most dangerous and dramatic Cold War sigint opera\u00ad\ntions remain largely unknown. Some of the most perilous \nmissions were not in the air along the Inner German Border, \nbut at sea. During the early 1950s, GCHQ and the Royal Navy \nhad developed a joint programme for the concerted monitoring \nof Soviet signals around Murmansk and other important naval \nbases within the Arctic Circle. This involved sending submarines \ninto Soviet territorial waters, and in some cases actually inside \nSoviet harbours. The Red Fleet knew these activities were taking \nplace, and often responded with depth charges, making such \nsecret missions breathtakingly dangerous. \nThe most important figures on these missions were the \n'sparkers'. These were radio communications operators who \nhad been sent to the Royal Navy's Signals SchooL located at \nthe naval station HMS Mercury near Petersfield in Hampshire, \nfor special training in sigint listening. Here, a secret unit called \nthe Radio Warfare Special Branch cooperated with GCHQ and \nplanned the naval dimension of Britain's sigint operations. Its \ntask was not only to record Soviet voice traffic and telegraphy, \nbut also to listen out for elint, including transmission from \nnew Soviet radars on high frequencies such as'S band' and \n'X band'. In May 1953, ten new recruits passed through the \nbasic radio course at Mercury and then, to their abundant \nhorror, were told that they had 'volunteered' for duty on \nsubmarines. The Royal Navy had only recently lost the \nsubmarines HMS Truculent and HMS Affray in tragic accidents, \nso submarines were not a particularly popular assignment at \nthe time. One of the more thoughtful individuals on this basic \nradio course, Tony Beasley, managed to dodge immediate \ndeployment to submarines by volunteering for a sigint course \nwith 'Special Branch' that included a long period ashore \nlearning Russian at HMS Pucklechurch. \n134 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nBy 1954, Beasley had managed to join the elite ranks of the \nRadio Warfare personnel, which had its own heavily guarded \ncompound on the northern edge of HMS Mercury. Here he \nwas first instructed in S~viet communication procedures in \npreparation for his language course. Although HMS Mercury \nwas far from the Soviet Union, radio signals bounced off the \nionosphere at night, so transmissions from as far afield as Baku \nand Tbilisi could be heard comfortably. Towards the end of the \nten-week 'special course' Beasley began to study the arcane \nsubject of Soviet radars and guidance systems, which consti\u00ad\ntuted elint collection. He had found his forte in the mysteri\u00ad\nous world of electronic signatures and wavebands, and \naccordingly he was diverted away from the Russian course at \nHMS Pucklechurch to become more of an elint specialist. Soon \nhe was serving on fishery-protection vessels, including HMS \nTruelove, Mariner and Pickle. Operating out of Norwegian \nharbours such as Troms0, their fishery duties gave them a legit\u00ad\nimate reason to be close to Soviet exercises in northern waters, \nallowing them to sit listening at their leisure, often using their \nown personal monitoring equipment which they put together \n'Heath Robinson style'. \nLate in 1954, Beasley and three of his comrades found them\u00ad\nselves back at HMS Mercury, where they had been called in to \nsee the head of the Radio Warfare Special Branch, Lieutenant \nCommander Harry Selby-Bennett. As experienced elint and \ncomint operators, they had been selected for 'special duties'. \nThey were told to write six weeks' worth of letters that would \nbe posted to their families at intervals, but were given no infor\u00ad\nmation about where they were going, or even what they might \ndo. Arriving at Portsmouth with their kitbags, they were trans\u00ad\nferred to a motor launch, still none the wiser about their mysteri\u00ad\nous task or their destination. One of the four suggested it might \nbe a submarine, but the other three laughed out loud at the \nidea, since none of them had been through the stringent oblig\u00ad\natory three-month submarine course at nearby Gosport, which \nincluded passing through the famous hundred-foot salt-water \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 135 \nescape tower. Moments later they pulled alongside the vessel on \nwhich they were to serve for many months. \n'Never in a million years were we expecting a submarine,' \nrecalls Beasley. 'We just could not believe it ... Standing \ntogether like clockwork soldiers we were ushered towards the \nescape hatch, just forward of the conning tower and told to \ndrop our holdalls down the steep ladder and follow. Time was \nof the essence: Their escort, Leading Seaman 'Snowy' Snow, \nwas horrified to discover that none of his new charges had \nbeen trained for submarines, and regarded them as a danger \nto themselves and the rest of the crew. One of Beasley's three \nfellow sparkers called out: 'What's the name of this iron coffin?' \nThe answer came back, 'HMS Turpin:28 \nHMS Turpin was a Group 3 T-class submarine which entered \nservice at the end of the Second World War. In 1945 the Allies \nwere aware that their submarine technology was well behind \nthat of the German U-boats, especially Hitler's legendary late\u00ad\nmodel Type-2Is. The Group I and Group 2 submarines that had \nbeen built earlier in the war were scrapped, but like the ill\u00ad\nfated USS Cochino, the Turpin and seven other Group 3 T-class \nsubmarines were sent for what was termed 'Super-T Conversion', \nessentially an interim measure before new classes of submarine \ncame on stream. Crucially, the later Group 3 submarines were \nof welded rather than riveted construction, making them more \nstreamlined than their predecessors. Their hulls were now \nlengthened to accommodate more electronic equipment, in some \ncases a sigint listening room, together with additional electric \nmotors and new batteries. The deck gun was removed and the \nconning tower replaced with a more modern design that enclosed \nthe periscopes and masts. The radar and sonar were improved. \nAll eight boats could now achieve a speed of over eighteen \nknots, giving them an excellent chance of evading any Soviet \nhunters.29 \nTony Beasley and his three 'Telegraphist Special' comrades \nwere treated to a tour of the Turpin. Snowy explained that, \ntogether with all the recent conversions to bring it up to the \n136 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nstandard of the most advanced German V-boats, extra rib \nsupports had been fitted to the pressure hull so that it could \nexceed its formal safety depth in case of an emergency. As the \nsparkers toured the suhmarine, their place in the operational \njigsaw gradually became clear. Of the eight submarines that had \nbeen converted to Super-T specification, the Turpin and the Totem \nhad been stripped of some of their radar and echo-sounding \nequipment, and had instead been fitted out with the most up\u00ad\nto-date sigint collection technology. The sigint receivers were \nattached to the snorkel and the aft periscope, and the wires \ntrailed everywhere. The sigint operators had their own listening \nroom near to the boat's operations centre. \nQuestions as to where they were going were met with blank \nlooks. Only the Commander, John Coote, knew their destina\u00ad\ntion, and he was keeping his mouth firmly shut. Before depar\u00ad\nture, the Turpin received its final blessing when a harbour tug \ncame out and painted over the serial number on the conning \ntower and spot-welded shut the escape hatches. This was because \nof the danger of ramming by a Soviet destroyer, which would \nrupture the hatches. With the escape hatches welded shut, all \nthe escape apparatus was useless, so it had been removed, \nmaking space for more stores for the long journey ahead. The \nmission was code-named 'Operation Tartan', and the destina\u00ad\ntion was the exercise area of the Soviet Northern Fleet on the \nKola Inlet and the Rybachi Peninsula, deep inside the Arctic \nCircle. \nDuring early March 1955 the crew endured a long journey \nnorth. Once they were within the Arctic Circle the sigint moni\u00ad\ntors began their work. Beasley's colleagues monitored comint \nwhile he listened for 'X band' and'S band' radar. While doing \nthis, to his surprise he detected an unusual short-range radar \nknown as 'Q band'. GCHQ had warned him before departure \nthat anything that was transmitted on 'Q band' would have a \nrange of no more than two and a half miles. The signal faded and \nthen returned much stronger. Beasley realised they were being \nrammed, and despite being new to submarines, instinctively \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 137 \nshouted out the command to crash dive. This was a perilous \nbusiness with the periscope and the snorkel still raised. Water \nbegan pouring into the control room through the snorkel. The \nperiscope was quickly lowered, and its handles, that weighed \nclose to a ton, hit Beasley, sending him crashing across the \ncontrol room and inflicting a debilitating lifelong neck injury. \nThe Turpin levelled off at 120 feet below the surface. The \nextremely cold water made sonar unreliable at any depth, and \nSoviet ships came and went for the next few hours, searching \nenergetically, but without finding their quarry. Glad to have \nevaded the submarine hunters, Commander Coote waited for \nthem to depart and then set a course for home.3D \nBack in London, the Admiralty Signals Division was doing \nwhat it could to protect the secrecy of its submarine missions. \nOne of the activities it undertook was a communications secur\u00ad\nity survey of the radio transmission from HMS Totem, Turpin's \nsister ship, while she was on an identical mission off the Soviet \ncoast code-named 'Operation Defiant'. The results were not \ngood. The Signals Division warned the Director of Naval \nIntelligence that the KGB's listeners, the Soviet equivalent of \nGCHQ, might well pick up 'unusual very secret traffic on a \nhome station submarine broadcast' continuing over a number \nof weeks, and might also notice that Totem was absent from the \nnormal exercise areas. In future, it suggested that a suitable \ncover plan with 'dummy communications' be thought up. This \ndummy traffic would have to run on a long-term basis if special \nsubmarine operations were to continue to be carried out at short \nnotice without the Soviets identifying what was going on.3J \nTony Beasley's next mission to the Arctic Circle, 'Operation \nSanjak', was yet more eventful. In July 1955 HMS Turpin had \nbeen loitering off the Soviet coast for over two weeks, but was \nexperiencing problems with its elint equipment. Reception was \ngood while the submarine was stationary, but not when it was \nin motion. They moved to the western edge of their patrol area \nso they could surface and see what was wrong. After a perilous \nclimb up the submarine fin in a rolling sea, the problem, which \n138 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nproved to be a cross-threaded aeriaL was resolved and Turpin \nsubmerged once more to complete the last few days of her \npatrol. The elint profiles of several radars from their intercept \ntarget list had already been collected, and with only two days \nto go they picked up an unusual contact. Commander Coote \ndecided to chase this contact to the edge of their permitted area, \nmoving closer to the coast than was allowed under their strict \noperating rules. Suddenly, Beasley intercepted an 'X band' radar \nvery close to them, and picked up a contact dead ahead. The \nTurpin crash dived immediately. \nAll four sigint operators now reported multiple contacts. They \nwere under attack. The warning was superfluous, since the \npropellers of several ships were quite audible as they passed \ndirectly over the submarine. Then came the horrible sounds of \nsplashes. These were depth charges. Beasley recalls: \n* The first depth charge exploded way under our depth of \n120 feet, followed by others, from different directions. A \nrather loud 'clunk' on our forward casing was followed by \nan enormous explosion which shook the boat, followed by \nothers at a greater depth. Another depth charge exploded \nclose above us rocking the boat much as before ... Depth \ncharging continued for longer than I care to remember. \n* Commander Coote took the submarine deeper and deeper, level-\nling off at their safety limit of 280 feet. Here they felt relatively \nsecure, and decided not to move, relying on the cold water to \nrender the Soviet sonar ineffective. However, they were painfully \nconscious that they were drifting in a strong current towards \nan area marked on their chart as being a probable Soviet mine\u00ad\nfield. \nAs they drifted away from the action the depth charges fell \nfurther and further away from their position. In the control \nroom everyone sat in silence, wondering what was next. Further \nshocks were not long in coming. They heard strange rasping \nsounds running down the side of the hull, followed by a 'twang' \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 139 \nas if a wire had been caught and had then come free. Some \nthought the noises were caused by pieces of ice, but they then \nrealised they had entered the minefield, and that it was the \nhawsers that attached the mines to the sea bed to keep them \nfrom floating away that were scraping the Turpin's sides. It was \nhigh time to cease drifting, set a course and pull away. \nAfter a long run south they surfaced off the coast of Norway, \nand the crew inspected the damage. The periscopes and snorkel \nwere grotesquely bent and completely unusable. Indeed, Turpin \nhad been stripped of a large part of its extremities by the multiple \nblasts of the depth charges. Guardrails, aerials, the sensors and \nmuch of the tail fin had also been blown away. Most dramat\u00ad\nically, the starboard outer casing had been torn apart, leaving \na thirty-foot gash which in one place was three feet deep. \nHowever, the diesel engines were undamaged, and they headed \nfor home, albeit with rather uncertain steering. Having lost their \naerials, they could not communicate. Eventually they found a \ntrawler out from Kingston-upon-Hull which relayed a message, \nallowing a rendezvous with a submarine depot ship, HMS \nMaidstone, which provided much-needed supplies of food and \nfresh water. \nReturning to HMS Mercury, they were given a week's leave. \nThe four sparkers were then debriefed in person by Lieutenant \nCommander Harry Selby-Bennett, the Controller of naval sigint \noperations. After being briefly congratulated on a successful \nmission, they were told to their surprise that for reasons of \n'continuity' of monitoring the Soviet transmissions they were \nabout to board HMS Totem for a mission that would last another \neight weeks. Understandably perhaps, Tony Beasley had now \nhad his fill of submarines, which he had never volunteered for. \nEventually he transferred to the Provost Branch, the Royal \nNavy's police service, to complete his naval service of sixteen \nyears.32 \nUntil 1956, Cabinet Ministers remained blissfully unaware of \nBritain's intelligence 'incidents', including the two perilous \n140 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nmissions of HMS Turpin in 1955. As a result the British remained \nmore relaxed about forward operations than their American \ncounterparts. By contrast the American intelligence community \nstrained on a tight leash held by the State Department, and \nindeed President Eisenhower himself. However, all that was \nabout to change. In April 1956 a single strange episode in \nPortsmouth harbour ensured that the situation was quickly \nreversed. Thereafter, growing hesitancy in Whitehall shifted the \nmomentum in the world of sigint special operations away from \nBritain towards the United States. The turning point was the \ninfamous 'Buster' Crabb incident. This offered Cabinet Ministers \na first-hand glimpse of the sheer scale of political embarrass\u00ad\nment that could be generated by bungled surveillance opera\u00ad\ntions. \nIn April 1956 the Soviet cruiser Ordjoninkidze carried the \nSoviet Premier, Nikolai Bulganin, and Nikita Khrushchev, leader \nof the Soviet Communist Party, on a goodwill visit to Britain. \nDespite some robust exchanges between the Soviets and \nAnthony Eden, Churchill's successor as Prime Minister, the visit \nwent well, and the Soviet delegation departed on 27 April 1956. \nHowever, even as it left the press had begun to speculate about \nthe mysterious disappearance of a British naval diver, \nCommander Lionel 'Buster' Crabb RNVR, in the vicinity of the \nvisiting Soviet cruiser. Fourteen months later, in June 1957, a \nheadless and handless body in a diving suit was recovered from \nthe sea near Pilsey Island in the English Channel. Over the \nyears, lurid tales of possible KGB abduction or beheading have \ncirculated. However, newly released intelligence files show that \nCrabb was almost certainly killed by being drawn through the \nship's propellers. Churning the propellers at intervals was a stan\u00ad\ndard defence against inquisitive divers whose presence was regu\u00ad\nlarly suspected during such visits. \nBuster Crabb had been the lead man on 'Operation Claret', \nan attempt by SIS to gain intelligence from the underwater \ninspection of the cruiser. He was one of the Royal Navy's most \nexperienced divers, and despite being demobbed in 1948 he \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 141 \nwas often recalled to help with difficult dives, including rescue \nwork on submarines lost in accidents. Even at this early stage \nof the Cold War, such secret operations required political \napproval. But in this instance the system had broken down. \nThe SIS officer who was tasked with securing the clearance \nfor Operation Claret had suffered a family bereavement and \nhad left the office before it had been obtained. His colleagues \npresumed that the green light had been given, but in fact it \nhad not. The first rule of intelligence management -having \npolitical clearance -had been broken, and the cost for the \nwhole British imelligence community was high.H \nWhat mattered to Eden was the public furore and the humili\u00ad\nation he suffered in the House of Commons. Not only had SIS \nbungled an unapproved mission, it also failed to cover its tracks. \nDespite the clumsy efforts of the local Special Branch to hide \nthe evidence, including ripping out pages from the register of \nthe hotel where Crabb had stayed, the press was soon on the \ntrail. Journalists quickly established that this was an SIS mission, \nand that no ministerial authority had been given. Hugh Gaitskell, \nthe leader of the opposition, enjoyed taunting his opponent on \nthe issue. Eden was furious and decided to take disciplinary \naction, telling the Ministers concerned to order their staff to \ncooperate fully with the ensuing investigation. This process cast \na long shadow over all the intelligence agencies, and ushered \nin an era of closer political control over special operations of \nevery kind.34 \nThe head of the inquiry, Sir Edward Bridges, a somewhat \nnineteenth-century figure, employed the JIC to help him ferret \nout all aspects of the Crabb incident. As a former Cabinet \nSecretary, Bridges identified 'certain questions' of a broader \nnature. While intrusive intelligence operations clearly had a \ncapacity to cause international repercussions, the systems for \ntheir authorisation were unclear.35 Bridges recommended a \nbroader inquiry reviewing all of Britain's strategic intelligence \nand surveillance activities, and assessing 'the balance between \nmilitary intelligence on the one hand, and civil intelligence and \n142 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \npolitical risks on the other'. Eden gave this job to Sir Norman \nBrook, the current Cabinet Secretary, working with Patrick \nDean, Chairman of the JIC.36 This review had immediate conse\u00ad\nquences for intelligence. In April 1956, coinciding with \nKhrushchev's visit to Britain, some of the first examples of the \nCIA's high-flying U-2 spy planes had arrived at RAF Lakenheath. \nThese aircraft were mostly known for their work with high\u00ad\naltitude photography, but some of their missions were also \nsigint-orientated. Eden now decided that this, and a host of \nother special operations, had to stop, and the U-2s were sent \nto alternative bases in Germany. 37 \nEden's angry response had some unintended benefits. In 1952 \nSir Stewart Menzies, Chief of SIS, had retired and was replaced \nby General Sir John Sinclair. The mediocre Sinclair had previ\u00ad\nously been Director of Military Intelligence, and while he was \nmore competent than his predecessor, he was not a moderniser. \nHe was now fired as a result of the Crabb incident; after the \nmultiple inquiries he was pleased to go, and confessed to a \nfriend in the sigint community that things were 'getting too hot \nfor me'. In the summer of 1956 Eden plumped for Sir Dick \nWhite, hitherto the Director General of MI5, as the new Chief \nof SIS. \nWhite was a man of enormous energy, and a forward thinker. \nTogether with his SIS staff officer, Harry 'Shergy' Shergold, he \nset about dragging SIS kicking and screaming into the mid\u00ad\ntwentieth century. For the first time in almost two decades the \norganisation had an effective manager at the top, and it now \ndeveloped into a really effective service.38 White's arrival also \nmarked the formal end of SIS influence over sigint. Sinclair was \nthe last Chief of SIS to chair the London Signals Intelligence \nBoard, Britain's highest sigint authority; this duty passed to Eric \nJones, the Director of GCHQ.39 \nEden's review was bad news for sigint special operations. As \nwe have seen, no less secret than the spy flights were the subma\u00ad\nrine missions. These were now being conducted by the British \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 143 \nand the Americans on the basis of mutual exchange, swapping \nproduct for product. Hawever, Eden's anger at the Buster Crabb \nincident meant that British submarine operations were cancelled. \nBritish officers in Washington spoke of their embarrassment that \ntheir half of the transatlantic deal could not be delivered on, \nwarning that British efforts would soon be eclipsed by American \nsubmarine commanders in the Atlantic, who were pushing ahead \n'so as not to be outdone by the Pacific submariners'. Like \nBletchley Park and Enigma a decade before, British Naval \nIntelligence wanted to keep its dominant position in the game \nof European submarine sigint. It urged not only that the \nprogramme be restored, but that it be followed by 'a bigger and \nbetter operation' .40 \nAs predicted, by the end of 1956 the US Navy was indeed \nbeginning its own independent sigint operations off Murmansk. \nInitially the American Office of Naval Intelligence had decided \nthat the British were not even to be informed. However, they \neventually realised that it would be foolhardy not to draw on \nthe more extensive British experience of similar operations in \nthese waters. Commander John Coote, who had been on the \nMurmansk run several times with the Turpin, and had joined \nthe Americans on the USS Stickleback in the Pacific, was called \nin to brief the first American crew. This was on the under\u00ad\nstanding that he told no other British naval officers in \nWashington. These new American submarine intelligence oper\u00ad\nations off Murmansk had been triggered by two factors. First, \nthe cancellation of British operations. Second, and ironically, \nthe US Navy had used the reports of previous British intelli\u00ad\ngence operations in the region to persuade the State Department \nthat 'the risks of detection are negligible'. Admiral Robert Elkins, \nthe senior British naval officer in Washington, warned First Sea \nLord Admiral Mountbatten that British intelligence prestige, \nwhich was currently high, would soon suffer 'unless we resume \nthese activities ourselves'. 41 \nIn 1957 a new Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, came to \nthe rescue. Intrusive operations using British aircraft, ships and \n144 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nsubmarines for sigint and photography were gradually resumed. \nBetween 1956 and 1960, twenty U-2 aircraft were involved in \noverflights, often from British bases. Some of these even used \nBritish pilots. Most of the deep-penetration flights were launched \nfrom Adana in Turkey, staging through Pakistan, and six RAF \npilots were based there. By 1957, Britain's elite Super-T \nsubmarines were gradually emerging from under the shadow \nof the Crabb incident, and were back in action on their perilous \nruns against the Soviet Northern Fleet. \nIn September 1957, HMS Taciturn took its turn to head north \non what were routinely eight-week secret patrols. Most of the \nfiles relating to these highly secret missions remain closed. \nHowever, fortunately for us this 'mystery trip' was recorded by \nMichael Hurley, a young submariner, in what was undoubtedly \nan illegal personal diary. Setting sail from Portsmouth on 4 \nSeptember, Commander Morris J. O'Connor chose not to tell \nhis crew about the nature of the voyage until they were under \nway. Two days later, the crew were briefed. They were 'going \nto snoop on the Russian Fleet exercises' in the Arctic, and if \nthey were detected it would be 'very unpleasant and most \ndangerous'. O'Connor explained that they would be running \nsubmerged most of the time, and would keep radio silence. On \ntheir return they were to say nothing of their mission, 'not even \nto wives and mothers', since this would be 'a wartime patrol'. \nAfter practising against a convenient British anti-submarine \nexercise off the Scottish coast, they took on more supplies at \nGreenock naval base in western Scotland and headed for the \nArctic Circle. Extra personnel had come on board to assist with \nthe listening, necessitating 'hot bunking' and meaning that water \nwas in short supply.42 \nOn 24 September they were able to get quite close to a Soviet \nsubmarine, and were able to record its signature over a period \nof more than an hour. Listening was undertaken by a special \nteam led by Lieutenant Commander George Lucas, a fluent \nRussian-speaker whom Hurley described as 'fat, foreign looking \nwith a slight accent'. However, the following day it was clear \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 145 \nthat they had been sighted, since 'a large number of aircraft plus \ntwo or three destroyers searched for us'. O'Connor had. strict \nwritten orders that in such circumstance the Taciturn should turn \nback and head for home. Aircraft continued to search for them \nas they made their way south. On 3 October they reached the \nsafety of Faslane naval base on the west coast of Scotland, and \n'a package', presumably the sigint recordings, was 'whisked off \nto Prestwick airport' and flown to the United States for analysis.43 \nMichael Hurley was back on special operations six months \nlater, with a further trip into Arctic waters. With much the same \ncrew and the obligatory 'special team' on board they sailed \ndown the Clyde and into open water on 13 March 1958. The \nextra personnel on board meant that water supply was again a \nproblem. The special passengers consisted of the familiar \nCommander Lucas, who turned out to be Polish, together with \na 'boffin' from the Underwater Development Establishment \ncalled Dr Newman and an American officer called Lieutenant \nBlock. There were also two further communications intelligence \nspecialists, including a Canadian. The routine was now familiar, \ndiving deep by day and attempting to 'snort' by night, although \nthis was often interrupted by Soviet aircraft. Snow storms \nprovided ideal cover for the use of the snorkel. The very cold \nexterior water temperature meant that icy drops of condensa\u00ad\ntion continually fell on the crew. The American officer took his \nturn at watches, and his distinctive voice on the Tannoy was a \nsource of amusement. Dr Newman spent much of his time in \nthe special sound room located in the Taciturn's expanded hull, \nworking on sigint collection.44 \nOn 28 March they moved in close to the Soviet coast, and \nbegan to encounter more signals traffic. The next day, they 'got \nsome good recordings' and managed to take some film footage \nof peculiar 'bullet shaped' aircraft that they did not recognise, \nand thought were possibly prototypes. On 2 April Hurley noted \nin his diary that they were well inside an inlet, with land less \nthan a mile away all around. He could see Soviet radar instal\u00ad\nlations silhouetted on the coast, and wrote, 'We are actually at \n146 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nthe entrance to a harbour.'45 If they were discovered here, there \nwas little chance of escape, and Hurley realised that this was \nperilous work indeed.46 By 3 April they had moved away from \nthe coast and were in open water at periscope depth, busy \nmaking good recordings of two destroyers, a Skory class and a \nKola class, together with some escorts, which were exercising. \nHurley records what happened next: \n* Then suddenly out of the sun astern another Skory \nappeared coming towards us. We went down to 120ft. On \nHusk [a listening system] we could hear him coming as \nthe sound of his engines grew louder. We went to Diving \nStations and Defence State One (just in case), she passed \nright overhead like an express train went on a little then \nmade a sharp turn and came back towards us again. As \nshe did so she dropped three charges which seemed of \ncourse very loud ... \n* The Taciturn went deep, down to 220 feet, and the Soviet ship \nmoved away. Remarkably, a little later they came up and began \nrecording the same vessels, although at a safer distance from \nboth their quarry and the shore.47 By 16 April they were on \ntheir way home. A week later they surfaced for the first time \nin thirty-four days. The Taciturn reached Faslane naval base four \ndays later, to be greeted by a visibly relieved head of submarine \noperations. Radio silence meant that for two months no one \nknew the fate of submarines on these missions.48 \nBy the late 1950s the Super-Ts, once the most advanced boats \nthe Navy could field, were suffering the wear and tear from \nlong patrols. Commanders would now refer to 'a shaky old T\u00ad\nboat'. Turpin, for example, had an elderly diesel engine for surface \npropulsion, in this case taken from another submarine, which \nhad already seen twelve thousand hours of service. In 1957, \nwhile on an operation in the Atlantic, the main engine gave \nup the ghost and the Turpin suffered the indignity of being \ntowed by an Admiralty tug for some five thousand miles. \nTHE VOYAGES OF HMS TURPIN 147 \nAlthough the T-boats were no longer safe for perilous oper\u00ad\nations against the Soviets, the elderly Turpin was re-engined \nand sent on further Arctic intelligence missions under the \ncommand of Alfie Roake. The first set off on 21 October 1959, \nand the second, launched on 6 February 1960, set a record for \nsnorkelling without surfacing of forty-two days.49 On the second \nmission there were a number of 'close encounters'. One of these \nwas thought to be with a Soviet torpedo, but fired at long range, \nallowing the Turpin to evade it by going deep and combing the \ntracks. Their closest call was being pursued by a flotilla of six \nSoviet destroyers, which they escaped by diving to a remark\u00ad\nable 425 feet, well below their safety depth. Engineers later told \nRoake that his hull would have collapsed like an eggshell at \n470 feet, and that they had a lucky escape.50 \nAlfie Roake's last mission into Soviet waters was launched in \nthe spring of 1960. By now he was very conscious that the \nelderly Super-Ts were 'nowhere near' American standards. A \nnew decade beckoned with the promise of the quieter and more \nreliable 'a' class submarines, and eventually nuclear vessels. \nJust like the Super-T class, some of these new boats were modi\u00ad\nfied for a special intelligence role and would be despatched on \nfurther hazardous missions inside the Arctic Circle.51 \n8 \nSigint in the Sun -GCH Q 's \nOverseas Empire \n... with 'Sigint' locking onto targets with pinpoint accuracy, our \nmilitary ached to have a go. \nTim Hardy, Special Branch, Sarawak, April 19641 \nIn the 1950s, GCHQ's top priontles were warning of an \nimpending war with Russia, and gathering intelligence on \nMoscow's growing nuclear arsenal. However, on a day-to-day \nbasis, the Middle East, Africa and Asia were the regions where \nsigint made a tangible difference. Since the end of the Second \nWorld War, Britain had been involved in a prolonged 'escape \nfrom empire', retreating from her colonies and hoping to replace \nthem with a vibrant Commonwealth of newly independent \nstates. The reality was more complex, since many of these coun\u00ad\ntries contained elements that were keen to evict the British \nfaster than they wished to go. Some hosted guerrilla groups \nsympathetic to Moscow, others were divided communities that \nfaced a troubled journey towards independence. The result was \nthat Britain was involved in an endless litany of small wars that \nstretched from the dusty deserts of Yemen to the steamy jungles \nof Borneo. Because these were often guerrilla wars, finding the \nenemy could be the main challenge, and here sigint was in its \nelement. Moreover, right across Asia and Africa, cyphers were \nless secure than those of countries like Russia, so GCHQ could \nalso read plenty of high-grade diplomatic traffic. \nAlthough sigint helped to smooth the end of Britain's empire, \nGCHQ itself did not always want empire to come to an end. \nBecause the 1950s and 1960s were an era when a great deal \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 149 \nof communications was sent over long distances using high\u00ad\nfrequency radio, GCHQ depended on the remnants of empire \nto provide a global network of ground stations to collect these \nsignals. Indeed, Britain's imperial real estate was one of the key \ncontributions to UKUSA, and was of particular assistance to the \nUnited States. Accordingly, in many colonies there were defence \nand intelligence bases that Britain wished to retain, prompting \nofficials to drag their feet over independence. Elsewhere, the \nBritish attempted to persuade post-independence governments \nto permit some bases to remain.2 \nThroughout the 1950s Britain fought one of the most \nprotracted colonial struggles of the post-war era, the Malayan \nEmergency. The enemy were a hardened band of Communist \nguerrillas who had been Britain's uneasy allies against the \nJapanese during the war. The military forces of the Malayan \nCommunist Party, or 'MCP', led by Ching Peng, operated from \nrefuges in the dense jungle. Britain did not initially recognise \nthe seriousness of the Emergency in Malaya, allowing it to get \nout of hand. However, in October 1951 the MCP succeeded in \nassassinating Sir Henry Gurney, the British High Commissioner. \nThereafter, striking back at the guerrillas and eliminating Ching \nPeng became a near-obsession for the security authorities in \nLondon. When Oliver Lyttelton, the Colonial Secretary, returned \nto London to report on Gurney's assassination he promised the \nCabinet that he would form special teams 'aimed at certain indi\u00ad\nviduals'. These were effectively killer squads, and he gave a firm \nassurance that they would 'hunt down individual men from \nCommunist higher formations through their families, proper\u00ad\nties, sweethearts etc:. 3 \nLocating the guerrilla headquarters in Malaya was easier said \nthan done. In 1950 a sigint-equipped Lancaster from the RAP's \n192 Squadron was sent out to help in the hunt for the insur\u00ad\ngents by tracking their radio communications. Later, undercover \nagents planted batteries with excessively high power on the \nguerrillas to damage their radios. When they were repaired, the \nworkshops the guerrillas used were bribed to secretly modify \n150 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nthe sets to give out a stronger signal. This gave the opportunity \nfor sigint to achieve a direction-finding fix on the main guer\u00ad\nrilla bases. Bombers from the RAF and the Royal Australian Air \nForce were standing by, and lightning raids were carried out on \nthe deemed location of the signals. Avro Lincoln bombers \ndropped thousands of tons of bombs into the dense jungle at \nlikely guerrilla locations. Their pilots were always impressed by \nthe resilience of the jungle: their largest bombs vanished into \nthe triple-canopied green foliage below them, and from the \naircraft little impact was visible. It is not known how successful \nthese operations were, but Ching Peng, the most important \nprize, certainly eluded them.4 \nIn January 1952, Sir Gerald Templer arrived as the new High \nCommissioner in Malaya. Templer possessed the authority and \ncharisma necessary to create a unified government machine and \nto implement an effective counter-insurgency strategy. Although \nfamed for his emphasis on 'hearts and minds', he also sorted out \nintelligence, creating a coherent structure in which the army, the \npolice and the civil authorities were forced to share intelligence. \nAll this was done with his customary fiery language -he was \nquite incapable of uttering a sentence without a cussword in it.5 \nDespite Templer's forceful direction, intelligence did not \nimprove overnight. An important intelligence issue that was \nnever quite resolved was the question of who was actually \nbehind the insurgency. The Colonial Office and the Special \nBranch officers of the Malayan Police preferred to interpret the \nEmergency as a wicked plot initiated by Stalin or else Mao, \nwhile the British diplomats tended to see it more as a local anti\u00ad\ncolonial uprising. During the mid-1950s GCHQ began to inter\u00ad\ncept what it believed to be wireless traffic between the MCP \nguerrilla leadership and the Chinese Communist Party in Peking. \nThe Special Branch presented this intelligence to senior British \nofficials in Kuala Lumpur with some delight as evidence of its \ntheory of external direction, but only in a summarised form. \nDiplomats in Kuala Lumpur were sceptical, and asked to see \nthe full transcripts of the transmissions. A major altercation \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 151 \nfollowed, with the diplomats accusing the Special Branch of \nbending the evidence, while the policemen accused the diplo\u00ad\nmats of a lack of trust. The issue of exactly how close the MCP \nwas to Peking was never resolved.6 \nGCHQ's most important outpost in Asia was Hong Kong. China \nwas the venue of one of Britain's early Cold War code-breaking \ntriumphs. Between March 1943 and July 1947 GCHQ was able \nto read the high-grade Russian cypher traffic passing between \nMoscow and its mission at the headquarters of Mao Tse-tung's \nPeople's Liberation Army in Yunnan. This was a highly secret \nprogramme, and GCHQ only began passing material to the \nAmericans in March 1946. The decision not to share until this \npoint may have reflected anxieties about the strong differences \nwithin the American administration about China policy, but it \nis noticeable that the spring of 1946 also marks the advent of \nthe revised BRUSA agreement.7 Exactly how this breakthrough \nwas achieved when many other Russian high-grade cypher \nsystems remained immune to attack is still a mystery. However, \nSIS had placed a rather eccentric officer called Michael Lindsay \nat Mao's headquarters in Yunnan, where he was assisting the \nChinese Communist communications team as their 'principal \nradio adviser'. This may eventually prove to be part of the story.8 \nThe British colony of Hong Kong was of special value to the \nUnited States. This reflected the fact that, after the end of the \nChinese Civil War that brought Mao Tse-tung to power in 1949, \nthe United States did not even have an embassy in mainland \nChina. 'Hong Kong became an American watchtower on China,' \nrecalls Jack Smith, who looked after the Far East in the CIA's \nOffice of National Estimates.9 GCHQ joined with the Americans \nand the equivalent Australian organisation, Defence Signals \nBranch, to develop the facilities in Hong Kong. Washington \nreceived the full intercept output of Hong Kong, but with the \nonset of the Korean War demands for intelligence went up \nsharply, and Washington considered that combined US-UK inter\u00ad\ncept facilities in the Far East were 'far short of requirements'. 10 \n152 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nIn July 1952 the US Communications Intelligence Board \npersuaded its British apposite numbers of the 'urgent need' to \nsend an additional eight-hundred-strong US Air Force sigint unit \nto Hong Kong to join the hard-pressed British and Australians. \nHowever, this was vetoed by the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir \nAlexander Grantham, who detested the way in which his terri\u00ad\ntory had become host to a myriad of espionage activities. I I Once \nthe Chinese had intervened in the Korean War, an attack on \nHong Kong by China was always a possibility. Therefore GCHQ \nnegotiated emergency facilities at Okinawa in Japan for the \nBritish and Australian sigint personnel working there.12 \nEven in 1955, the United States was still negotiating for new \nsites in Asia. Sigint sites were not small or discreet, often \nrequiring vast acres of wireless masts known as 'aerial farms' \nto capture signals of interest. In Taiwan, American officials had \nrun into trouble securing a 335-acre site near Nan-Szu-Pu airfield \nwhere they had plans to locate hundreds of personnel from the \nArmy Security Agency.13 With repeated clashes between the \nUnited States and Communist China over the Taiwan Straits in \nthe late 1950s, the British government reviewed the future of \nHong Kong, which seemed exposed, and pondered the short\u00ad\nterm value of the continued British presence in the colony. \nMuch turned on the mysteries of the UKUSA alliance, the \nAnglo-American-Commonwealth sigint pact of cooperation, \nsince Hong Kong hosted British, Australian and American eaves\u00ad\ndroppers.14 Alongside the GCHQ activities there were also vast \nBritish and American programmes in Hong Kong for running \nagents and interviewing defectors from mainland China. During \nthe 1950s and 1960s, both the State Department and the \nPentagon considered Hong Kong to be the single most impor\u00ad\ntant British overseas territory from the point of view of intel\u00ad\nligence-gathering.15 \nIn order to stimulate more defectors from China to Hong \nKong, Britain launched 'Operation Debenture' in 1954. This \nwas a covert radio project and constituted 'the first UK opera\u00ad\ntions of any magnitude for the penetration of Mainland China'. \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 153 \nThe aim was to provide an undercover broadcasting station that \nwould increase the desire for contacts with the West amongst \nthe Chinese middle classes, and increase defections across the \nborder into Hong Kong. The emphasis was on the 'purely \"intel\u00ad\nligence\" angle', and the defectors were needed because SIS \nhuman agent coverage of China was weak. The original inten\u00ad\ntion had been to place this 'black station' in Hong Kong, but it \nwas eventually located in Singapore, hidden at one of the mili\u00ad\ntary bases.16 \nThe main GCHQ sigint stations in Hong Kong were on the \ncoast at Little Sai Wan and the curiously-named outpost known \nas 'Batty's Belvedere'. The contribution of Australia's Defence \nSignals Branch was important, since Australia had identified \nChina as its top sigint target, followed by Indonesia and then \nVietnamY During the late 1950s the commander of the sigint \nstation was an Australian called Ken Sly, and originally it was \nstaffed by airmen from the RAP's 367 Signals Unit. IS A constant \nflow of National Servicemen had learnt Chinese at RAF Wythall \nnear Birmingham and later at RAF North Luffenham in \nLeicestershire, but by 1957 the increasing use of civilians with \nqualifications in the language was reducing this considerable \ntraining requirement. There was also a separate cohort of \nVietnamese linguists. 19 Civilianisation brought unexpected secur\u00ad\nity problems, since civilians could not be used for some of the \nmenial duties carried out by service personnel. GCHQ tried to \naddress this problem by employing deaf and dumb locals in the \nmore sensitive locations on the sites.20 \nKen Sly was well aware of the attentions of Chinese intelli\u00ad\ngence. One of the locally employed Chinese, Wal Bin Chang, \nshowed a propensity for taking photographs of groups on social \noccaSIOns, and 'also took care to photograph each one of us \nseparately'. Moreover, he tended to volunteer for extra duties \nat unsociable hours. He was eventually captured on the border \ntrying to cross over into Communist China with a number of \ndocuments, including a description of the personal habits of \nevery NCO and officer at the base. He had been entertaining \n154 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nsome of them in 'girlie bars', and admitted that he had persuaded \none of the officers to sleep with his wife, adding: 'In this way \nI will be able to obtain much more information of value to our \nside.' The officer in question was swiftly discharged. Military \nstaff at overseas listening stations working for GCHQ were a \ncontinual target for this sort of honey-trap.21 Ken Sly was even\u00ad\ntually replaced by a civilian with the rank of Senior Linguist \nOfficer, and moved on to serve in Australia and then with GCHQ \nat Cheltenham.22 \nIn both Hong Kong and Cyprus, the British were experi\u00ad\nmenting with intelligence-gathering radar. At Hong Kong the \nmain site was located three thousand feet up the precipitous \ncliffs of Tai Mo Shan in the New Territories. Operated jointly \nby the RAP's 117 Signals Unit and the Australians, it peered \nout into Chinese airspace, and its main purpose was 'to provide \nintelligence information for the UK, USA and Australia'.23 \nWestern aircraft regularly intruded over the border to generate \nan elint response from Chinese defences.24 The site was \nconstructed with great difficulty in 1957 and was operated \ncontinuously into the 1980s. By a heroic effort, cranes and \nlorries had moved materials up to the summit by means of what \nwas little more than a jeep track. During construction a ten\u00ad\nton crane had been lost over the edge, but fortunately the RAF \ndriver leapt clear before the vehicle disappeared over the cliff. \nLater, the RAF Regiment, known as the 'Rock Apes', who \nguarded the base, lost two Land Rovers over the cliff. This \nprompted a local humorist to erect a sign at the base of the \nuphill trail that warned: 'Beware of Falling Rocks' .25 \nGCHQ does not seem to have broken much high-grade \nChinese traffic; nevertheless, there were intelligence success \nstories. One of the most important was the prediction of the \ndetonation of China's first nuclear weapon in 1964. Like all \nsuch programmes, China's efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon \nrequired a vast technical and industrial effort, therefore imagery \nfrom overflights together with relatively low-level signals gave \na good indication of progress. Archie Potts, the UK's Deputy \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 155 \nDirector of Atomic Energy Intelligence, noted that for about five \nyears the British had been aware of an important secret \nprogramme controlled by 'a special ministry'. Plant construc\u00ad\ntion had begun in 1958, with an elaborate effort to produce \nuranium ore. The Chinese had also ceased their public complaints \nabout superpowers with nuclear weapons. All this prefaced \nChina's first nuclear test.26 \nAlthough NSA viewed Hong Kong as Britain's single most valu\u00ad\nable overseas sigint station, GCHQ placed more emphasis on \nthe Middle East. Immediately after the war, Britain had \nnumerous interception stations. The most important was at \nHeliopolis in Egypt, which boasted many civilian operators and \ntook in much of the region's diplomatic traffic. The Army ran \na large intercept station at Sarafand in Palestine, while the RAF \nran a similar installation at RAF Habbaniya in Iraq. There were \nundercover listening stations buried within embassies and \nconsulates in countries such as Thrkey. By the 1950s Britain \nhad also developed covert sites in northern Iran that were \nfocused on Russia. However, the British Empire in the Middle \nEast consisted of very few formal colonies and had long been \nan agglomeration of mandates, shaky treaty relationships and \nuncertain base rights granted by royalist regimes. Egypt, which \nhad achieved independence in 1935, was especially anxious to \ndivest itself of the disfiguring presence of British bases. \nAccordingly, British sigint gradually fell back towards its last \nproper colonial foothold in the region, the island of Cyprus. \nCyprus was increasingly the home for every kind of secret \nradio activity in the Middle East. This included not only Britain's \nsigint assets but also the monitoring sites of the CIA's Foreign \nBroadcast Information Service, which listened in to news broad\u00ad\ncasts around the world. In addition, Cyprus offered a safe haven \nfor Britain's overt and covert propaganda broadcasting in the \nregion. This mushroomed during the premiership of Anthony \nEden, who nurtured a special hatred of Egypt's nationalist leader \nGeneral Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom he viewed as a dangerous \n156 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ndictator. Eden urged a reduction of British radio propaganda \ndirected at the Soviets in favour of targeting Nasser.27 As early \nas 1954 he insisted that a new broadcasting station in Aden \ncovering Iraq and Syria was to receive 'first priority', since \nNasser's radio station, The Voice of Egypt, was busily pouring \nout its own vitriolic message.28 Britain's main radio weapon \nagainst Nasser was the SIS-owned station in Cyprus, Sharq el\u00ad\nAdna. 'Sharq' had originated as a wartime British propaganda \nradio station that had been taken over by SIS in 1948, and been \nevacuated from Palestine to the safety of Cyprus. It was soon \nthought to be the most popular station in the region.29 SIS was \nworking with John Rennie, the head of Britain's Information \nResearch Department, to accelerate four other radio projects in \nthe Middle East, including a secretive 'black station' that was \nbeing developed at two other sites on Cyprus with a transmitter \nthat could reach as far as Aden.30 \nOn 29 October 1956 Eden launched 'Operation Musketeer', \na surprise attack to capture the Suez Canal, which Nasser had \nrecently nationalised. Sigint and radio warfare had an impor\u00ad\ntant part to play. Arrangements were made for the force \ncommanders to receive a range of key intelligence materials \nfrom national sources, including photo-reconnaissance cover \nand 'all CX [SIS] reports on Egypt', as well as material from \n'special sources', a somewhat coy cover name for sigint. GCHQ \nattached liaison officers to the main Army, Navy and RAF \ncommanders, and detailed instructions were generated to \nprovide cover for the 'protection of SIGINT material'.3l Most of \nthe sigint coverage came from 2 Wireless Regiment at Ayios \nNikolaos near Famagusta in eastern Cyprus, with additional help \nfrom listeners at Dingli on Malta. While the coverage was good, \nthe radio channels available to push this material forward to \nfield commanders were often choked. In addition, a small tactical \n'V' intercept unit was being prepared to accompany the land \nforce from Cyprus to the landings in Egypt, and was eventu\u00ad\nally based at Port Said.32 \nThe British not only had to hide the invasion preparations \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 157 \nfrom the Egyptians, but also from the Americans. Britain had \nengaged in an elaborate plot with the French and the Israelis \nwhich hid the real reasons for the intervention by presenting \nit as the arrival of a so-called 'peace-keeping' force for the \ndisputed Suez Canal Zone. Eisenhower and his Secretary of \nState John Foster Dulles were astonished by Anglo-French\u00ad\nIsraeli collusion over Suez. In the autumn of 1956 Washington's \neyes were elsewhere, distracted by the uprising in Hungary, \nwhile in the Middle East its focus was on the possible break\u00ad\nup of Jordan and the likelihood of Israeli and Arab attempts to \ndivide the spoils. American U-2 flights out of Turkey detected \nan Israeli mobilisation, but this was interpreted by some as part \nof Israeli ambitions on the West Bank. Allen Dulles, the Director \nof CIA, was tracking reports of an imminent coup in Syria. \nNevertheless, the ability of the British to hide 'Operation \nMusketeer' from NSA raises some interesting questions. What \nwere American sigint liaison officers doing? During the Suez \ninvasion there was a US Sixth Fleet exercise off Crete, yet \nAmerican Naval intelligence conceded frankly that it had 'no \nwarning of British intentions'.33 Much of the story can be \nexplained by NSA's obsessive focus on Russia, with the vast \nmajority of its assets in locations such as Turkey looking north\u00ad\nwards to the missile-testing stations of the Caucasus. Meanwhile \nNSA depended on GCHQ for much of its coverage of the Middle \nEast. Moreover, the crisis occurred just as the American code\u00ad\nbreakers were moving to their new building at Fort Meade. The \nfailure to spot the Suez Crisis had a significant effect on NSA, \ntriggering a post-mortem and the creation of new divisions based \non country or geographicallines.34 \nThe British deliberately blanked their American allies. In a \nneat piece of choreography, the British Ambassador to \nWashington was replaced at this moment, with the new man \nbeing sent across the Atlantic by passenger liner. He was thus \nin mid-ocean when the Suez Crisis broke, and could not be \naccused of having deceived the Americans. In Tel Aviv, the \nBritish and French Military Attaches were told to give their \n158 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nAmerican counterpart a wide berth.35 However, the American \nMilitary Attache realised something was up when his civilian \ndriver, a reservist in the Israeli Army who had only one arm, \none leg and was blind in one eye, was suddenly recalled to \nduty. His American employer deduced -Quite correctly -that \nif his driver was being mobilised it could only mean one thing: \nimminent war.36 \nThe sharpest Americans knew something was afoot. On 12 \nSeptember 1956 Robert Amory, Deputy Director for Intelligence \nat the CIA, set up a highly secret joint group from the CIA, \nNSA, the State Department and military intelligence to watch \nthe Middle East round the clock.37 Its main source of informa\u00ad\ntion was an expansion of the U-2 spy plane operations from \nWiesbaden covering the Middle East. The CIA's own U-2 offi\u00ad\ncial history claims that this allowed them to predict the attack \non Egypt three days before it took place.38 This is probably an \nexaggeration: the U-2 evidence of growing forces on the ground \nwas not precise enough to make such a forecast. Allen Dulles, \nthe Director of the CIA, told Eisenhower he believed the Israelis \nwere about to attack Jordan. Eisenhower attached special signif\u00ad\nicance to NSA reports of an increase in signals traffic between \nTel Aviv and Paris.39 Almost certainly from sigint, the Americans \nhad also picked up news of a secret meeting between the British \nForeign Secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, and the French in Paris on or \nabout 15 October. This was the very sensitive meeting that sealed \nthe deal over the Suez invasion. Allen Dulles recalls: 'I remember \nI had a long talk with Foster [Dulles] about what this might \nmean in view of the fact that we were not otherwise informed \nabout it.'40 But Eisenhower personally dismissed the significance \nof the military build-up on Cyprus, refusing to believe that \nBritain would be 'stupid enough to be dragged into this'. \nRemarkably, six weeks after the invasion of Suez, many in the \nCIA were still uncertain whether the British had colluded directly \nwith the Israelis.41 Both NSA and the CIA had also failed to \npredict the Russian invasion of Hungary, so 1956 was not their \nbest year. 42 \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 159 \nDeliberate American pressure on the pound eventually forced \nBritain's ignominious withdrawal from Suez, and contributed \nto Eden's sudden resignation in January 1957. Eden's foreign \npolicy may have failed, but the intelligence support he received \nhad been excellent. In the wake of Suez, Selwyn Lloyd wrote \nto Eric Jones, the Director of GCHQ, congratulating him on the \ntorrents of Middle East intelligence that sigint had provided \nduring the crisis, particularly after the seizure of the canal. '1 \nhave observed the volume of material which has been produced \nby G.C.H.Q. relating to all the countries in the Middle East area,' \nhe wrote, suggesting that the traffic of many countries was being \nread, and added: '1 am writing to let you know how valuable \nwe have found this material and how much 1 appreciate the \nhard work and skill involved in its production.' Jones passed \non these congratulations to units such as the Army's 2 Wireless \nRegiment on Cyprus and the RAP's 192 Squadron.43 There had \nalso been shipborne signals interception by the Royal Navy. The \nRAF airborne signals element was especially important during \nthe invasion. The ageing RB-29 Washingtons had been \ndespatched from Watton to map the characteristics of Egyptian \nanti-aircraft defence. This included the habit of shutting down \nair-defence radar routinely just after midday - a priceless piece \nof information.44 \nAt a higher level, GCHQ read much of Cairo's diplomatic \ntraffic with key embassies in the region during the mid-1950s, \nsuch as those in Amman and DamascusY It also read traffic \nwith Egypt's London Embassy.46 No less importantly, GCHQ \nstepped up its watch on the Soviets. On 15 November 1956, \nBritain's leaders were reassured that there was 'still no evidence \nfrom signals intelligence sources of any large-scale Soviet prepar\u00ad\nations to intervene by force in the Middle East' Y However, there \nhad been problems. Some of the newly civilianised sigint sites \nhad complained about working round the clock during the crisis, \ncausing managers to wonder about the wisdom of non-military \nintercept operations.48 \n* * * \n160 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nDespite GCHQ's operational success, the Suez Crisis left a prob\u00ad\nlematic legacy. It led directly to the eviction of GCHQ from some \nof its more valuable real estate in the Middle East and the Indian \nOcean. In December 1956 GCHQ was just opening a large and \nwell-equipped secret sigint station covering the Indian Ocean \nat Perkar on Ceylon, which had been constructed at a cost of \nclose to \u00a32 million. The Ceylonese government had wanted to \nfree up access to the old sigint site at HMS Anderson for rede\u00ad\nvelopment. The purpose of the GCHQ site at Perkar was hidden \nfrom the Ceylonese, requiring the British to generate a cover \nstory. Much debate had taken place in London over whether \nto let the Ceylonese Prime Minister, Solomon Bandaranaike, in \non the real function of the station. GCHQ decided against \ncandour, fearing 'leakage'.49 British officials had always been \nconvinced that 'the real purpose could be easily disguised'. 50 \nEndless effort had gone into the Perkar site. By 1955 it had \nbeen upgraded to monitor signals traffic from 'all bearings', and \nboasted a vast aerial farm that covered more than four hundred \nacres.5l Yet the Suez operation effectively destroyed this expen\u00ad\nsive new facility almost as soon as it was completed. The \nCeylonese were incensed at Eden's imperial escapade, and \nbelieved the British had refuelled ships in Ceylon en route to \nthe invasion of Egypt. They now demanded a schedule for the \nremoval of all foreign bases, without exception. The Treasury \nwas aghast, stating that even a brief visit to Ceylon 'brings home \nthe complexity of these installations' and 'their vital impor\u00ad\ntance'. Officials came up with the preposterous idea of using \nservice personnel in civilian clothes in the hope of assuaging \nthe Ceylonese.52 Bandaranaike stamped his foot, insisting that \nall the British, however attired, had to go. A compromise was \nagreed: 'The GCHQ station can be given up entirely, but we \nshould like to keep it in operation for five years.' Ultimately, \nBritain had lost the best site in the Indian Ocean.53 \nGCHQ felt the reverberations of Suez elsewhere. In Iraq, \nBritain enjoyed a good relationship with the ruler King Faisal. \nAs a result, the British had been allowed to retain a number of \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 161 \nbases. One of these was RAF Habbaniya, not far from Baghdad. \nSuperficially this looked like so many military aerodromes in \nthe Middle East, but in fact it housed 123 Signals Squadron, \nlater 276 Signals Squadron, which ran a large sigint monitoring \nstation. Airborne sigint flights from Habbaniya crossed into Iran, \nand then loitered over the Caspian Sea. However, as a result of \nSuez, Faisal's political situation deteriorated rapidly, with upris\u00ad\nings in the cities of Najaf and Hayy. Iraq's membership of the \nBaghdad Pact, a British-managed military alliance, only exac\u00ad\nerbated popular hatred of the regime. Then, in the summer of \n1958, Faisal's ally, King Hussein of Jordan, asked for military \nassistance during a growing crisis in the Lebanon. The Iraqi \nArmy put together an expeditionary force, but in the early hours \nof 14 July 1958 the assembled column turned against its own \nsupreme commander, marched right into Baghdad and carried \nout a coup. Revolutionary officers arrived at the Royal Palace \nat 8 o'clock in the morning and ordered the King, his imme\u00ad\ndiate family and his personal servants into the courtyard. They \nwere politely asked to turn away from their captors, where\u00ad\nupon they were machine-gunned. Most died instantly, but Faisal \nsurvived a few hours. Fortunately, GCHQ intercepts of Egyptian \ndiplomatic traffic gave precise information about Nasser's parallel \nplots against the King of neighbouring Jordan a few days later, \nprompting timely British support for the beleaguered monarch. 54 \nHowever, Britain's time in Iraq was now up, and the final \ndeparture from RAF Habbaniya was anything but orderly. The \nvast base had quickly been occupied by the Iraqi Fourth \nArmoured Division, and the British had even been denied access \nto their own signals installations and aerial farms. Most of the \nRAF's 276 Signals Unit were evacuated to temporary tented \naccommodation on Cyprus, where they continued their inter\u00ad\nception work amid terrible conditions. Three hundred personnel \nremained at Habbaniya, presiding over the residual technical \nfacilities and stores. They were continually provoked by Iraqi \nforces, and it was not unusual for them to 'end up in the Iraqi \nguard room'. Although much of the radio equipment had been \n162 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nremoved, the remnants included specialist signals vehicles, \nmachine tools and fuel, together with the entire contents of a \nnearby RAF hospital. 55 The plan was for a massive 'end of empire' \ngarage sale. Items froll1 Habbaniya were offered to the new \nBa'athist government. The Iraqi Army took the heavy weapons, \nexplosives and ammunition, but were warned soberly that some \nof these were in 'a dangerous or doubtful condition'. What \nmaterials the Iraqi government did not want were then sold \npublicly. However, in the revolutionary climate, the ensuing \nauction was pure bedlam. Such was the shouting and violence \nthat the petrified auctioneer tried to sell off the entire stock of \nthe base as one lot. Another sale, of vehicles, was sabotaged by \nthe appearance of a small but violent nationalist mob whose \nmembers held 'a rope noose ... menacingly over the head of \nanybody who attempted to purchase' anything. The end of the \nBritish Empire is often portrayed as a serene process, but in the \nMiddle East its passing was neither orderly nor pleasant.56 \nCyprus was now a vast GCHQ refugee camp, holding sigint \npersonnel who had made their exodus from the listening stations \nat Sarafand in Palestine, Heliopolis in Egypt, and now Habbaniya. \nOver a thousand found themselves in a tented encampment at \nRAF Pergamos.57 A special signals unit was already at the forty\u00ad\nthree-acre site, which was dominated by aerials, but the refugees \nfrom Habbaniya represented a further unscheduled expansion. 58 \nPergamos and the Army station run by 2 Wireless Regiment \n(soon renamed 9 Signals Regiment) at Ayios Nikolaos now \nconstituted the key sigint stations in the region, with over a \nthousand personnel. Further west, there was a British sigint \nstation at Dingli on Malta with 230 staff, and a few dozen on \nAscension Island and at Gibraltar; but Cyprus was the leviathan. 59 \nNegotiations over the exact extent of the Sovereign Base Areas \non Cyprus were ongoing, but at least for the time being, rela\u00ad\ntions with the island's authorities were relatively cordial.60 The \nnegotiations reached a climax in 1959. The British delegation, \nled by Julian Amery, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies, \nstarted with an extravagant bid for four hundred square miles \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 163 \nof territory, and eventually settled for ninety-nine square miles.61 \nBy this time the aerials and antennae of the largest sigint base \non Cyprus, Ayios Nikolaos, had begun to encroach on the munic\u00ad\nipal area of Famagusta itself. The ruler of Cyprus, Archbishop \nMakarios, protested, and GCHQ agreed that it could retreat a \nlittle without serious damage to its operations.62 \nThe main problem for GCHQ was that the two Cyprus \nSovereign Base Areas were increasingly expensive to run. This \npartly reflected an ongoing insurgency by a guerrilla force known \nas EOKA, which wanted unification or 'enosis' with Greece. \nMatters were made worse by the intense divisions between the \nGreek and Turkish communities on Cyprus. As a result, the \nsecurity of the two sigint stations required a minimum land \nforce garrison, including a heavy RAF presence. GCHQ's exten\u00ad\nsive aerial farms were also vulnerable to sabotage. However, \nonce the Chiefs of Staff had accepted that the major bases 'must \nbe retained because of the SIGINT facilities', other things \nfollowed. Typically, the RAF decided to keep its main regional \nstockpile of nuclear weapons, code-named 'Tuxedo', at Dhekelia. \nIn other words, while the Cyprus garrison was not there solely \nfor sigint, it was the sigint facilities that made it irreplaceable.63 \nThe periodic outbreaks of inter-communal strife on Cyprus led \nto questions from the Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home, \nwho asked in December 1963 whether Britain really needed \nbases there. Peter Thorneycroft, the Defence Secretary, \nresponded with an unqualified yes, explaining that Cyprus \n'houses most important SIGINT stations and it also provided a \nbase from which special reconnaissance flights are carried out'. \nThorneycroft said that while most of the other activities could \nbe relocated, intelligence was the sticking point, since it was \n'not considered that SIGINT facilities could be adequately \nreplaced elsewhere'. 64 \nThe impact of GCHQ's work in the Middle East is best illus\u00ad\ntrated by the Yemen Civil War. This conflict had its origins in \na coup by the leader of Yemen's republican faction, Abdullah \nas-Sallal, who overthrew the newly crowned Imam al-Badr in \n164 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \n1962. However, the Imam escaped and the royalist faction was \nsoon receiving support from Saudi Arabia and, more covertly, \nfrom Britain, Jordan and Israel. Predictably, the republicans were \nsupported by General N\"asser, with perhaps seventy thousand \nEgyptian 'volunteers'. King Hussein of Jordan pressed London \nto intervene on behalf of the Imam, and an elaborate merce\u00ad\nnary operation was developed, using both SIS and the SAS. \nSigint not only gave a detailed picture of Egyptian troop deploy\u00ad\nments, but also revealed tensions between republican ministers \nand the Chief of Staff of the Egyptian armed forces. The British \nreportedly found breaking the codes of Egyptian forces in the \nfield 'a bit of fun', and also had no difficulty in reading higher\u00ad\nlevel diplomatic traffic. GCHQ intercepts seem to have been \nimportant in October 1962, informing the JIC, and later the \nCabinet, about the morale of the Egyptian troops. The Governor \nof neighbouring Aden, Sir Charles Johnstone, had suggested \nthat this was low, but intercepts showed quite the reverse. This \nprefigured a long struggle with the Egyptian proxies which \ndragged on until 1970.65 \nThe most decisive role played by sigint was during the \n'Confrontation' between Indonesia and the British-backed \nFederation of Malaysia during the early 1960s. In fact the \n'Confrontation' was an undeclared war which involved troops \nfrom Britain, Australia and New Zealand. President Sukarno of \nIndonesia had decided that Britain's creation of the Federation \nof Malaysia in 1962, which included parts of the island of \nBorneo, was an attempt to maintain a colonial presence by \nstealth and should be resisted. The first shots were fired in \nDecember 1962, when the Indonesian government attempted \na coup against the Sultan of Brunei, an independent pro-British \nstate on the island of Borneo. The Indonesians used a proxy \nforce to try to capture the Sultan, and also attempted to seize \nBrunei's oilfields. The revolt was suppressed using Gurkhas \nflown in from Singapore, but it was a close-run thing. Had the \nGurkhas arrived an hour later, the Sultan might have been \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 165 \ncaptured and forced to abdicate. The Gurkhas had been slow \nin arriving because a British staff officer who loved paperwork \nhad been laboriously recording the name of each man as he \nboarded the aircraft. Eventually, 'an angry Brigadier threw the \nmovement papers onto the tarmac' and the rescue finally got \nunder way.66 \nIn early 1963, President Sukarno announced that he would \nstep up the pace and pursue a policy of 'Konfrontasi' with \nMalaysia. By April, two thousand Indonesian 'volunteers', many \nof whom were commandos, were infiltrating into the neigh\u00ad\nbouring British colonies of Sarawak and Sabah in northern \nBorneo, and were soon clashing with units of Gurkhas. Buoyed \nup by their success, Indonesian troops actually attempted to raid \nthe mainland of Malaysia in 1964. At this point the British \ngovernment deployed the SAS, later assisted by similar special \nforce units from Australia and New Zealand. By 1964 there \nwere over ten thousand British and Commonwealth troops in \nBorneo. British soldiers were being awarded medals in a secret \nwar that remained undeclared.67 \nSigint assisted this clandestine conflict directly and decisively. \nMost importantly, it was used in a revolutionary new way in \nconjunction with special forces. In April 1964 the British \ncommander in Borneo, General Walter Walker, was given \npermission to begin highly secret 'Claret' operations. These were \ncounter-infiltrations across the border into the Indonesian terri\u00ad\ntory of Kalimantan in southern Borneo, designed to take the \nwar to the enemy. British forces were initially given permission \nto cross over the thousand-mile-Iong border into Kalimantan \nto a distance of three thousand yards. By 1965 this had been \nextended to twenty thousand yards.68 Locating the enemy was \nthe main challenge, and tactical sigint was used to provide accu\u00ad\nrate direction-finding on the elusive Indonesian jungle camps. \nSigint operators would listen in to the Indonesian traffic to see \nif the Claret patrols had been picked up. On one occasion the \noperators listened in to the Indonesians as they prepared to \nambush a Claret patrol, and were able to warn the intended \n166 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nvictims, who then scooted back over the border. Tim Hardy, a \nSpecial Branch officer, recalls that the local British sigint teams \nhad no difficulty intercepting Indonesian field pack radios, which \nwere of Second World War vintage. Moreover, they used old\u00ad\nfashioned crystals to set the frequency, and 'in defiance of all \nmilitary rules, these never changed'. As a result Indonesian field \ncommunications were an open book, and sigint was 'locking \nonto targets with pinpoint accuracy'. Hardy met SAS patrols \ncoming back over the border accompanied by local Iban native \ntrackers who carried 'gory trophy heads'.69 \nFrom February 1965 onwards the British troops engaged in \nlittle other than Claret special operations. Brigadier Bill Cheyne, \nthe Director of Operations in Borneo, declared that 'CLARET \noperations so weakened the Indonesian resolve to fight that \nonly their very best troops ventured into Sarawak latterly.' The \nnumber of incursions fell so dramatically by late 1965 -they \nbecame 'as rare as snakebite' -that it was a major event when \none occurred. Cheyne considered the use of tactical sigint vital, \nand for security reasons even the special forces were not told \nof this secretive source. Instead, there were stories of human \nagent operations and 'other sources of intelligence to shelter \nbehind'.70 The top brass knew about it though, and Walter \nWalker, the British Commander in Chief, constantly praised the \nability of sigint to pinpoint the enemy: 'Nine times out of ten \nwe knew his every move and we brought him to battle long \nbefore he had reached a point from which he could mortar a \nvillage, let alone a town.'71 \nBritain had developed an extensive sigint station in Singapore, \nrun jointly with Australia. However, much of the sigint effort \nduring the Confrontation was undertaken locally by 651 Signals \nTroop, staffed by personnel on special detachment from 13 \nSignals Regiment, the main British Army sigint unit in Germany. \nThey worked closely with 693 Signals Troop from Royal \nAustralian Signals. Mixed units moved freely between bases at \nSingapore, Labuan and Kuching. Signals intelligence functioned \nat several levels. The main support to Claret operations came \nSIGINT IN THE SUN -GCHQ'S OVERSEAS EMPIRE 167 \nfrom local radio direction-finding and voice interception. \nTelephone tapping on the Indonesian side of the border was \nalso very productive. Meanwhile, higher-level Indonesian diplo\u00ad\nmatic traffic was also being read in Singapore and at GCHQ at \nCheltenham.72 The result was 'high-grade intelligence that \ncontributed significantly to the successful outcome of the \nconflict'.73 Because of Australian worries about the disputed \nterritory of West Irian, Indonesia remained Australia's main \nsignals intelligence priority through the 1960s, even higher than \nVietnam.74 \nBy March 1965 the British government was asking how long \nthe Confrontation would last. The Joint Intelligence Committee \nFar East, which included Brian Tovey from GCHQ, did its best \nto answer this. Sigint was a helpful indicator, since it showed \nthat Sukarno was deploying large-scale units of the Indonesian \nArmy's strategic reserve to Kalimantan, and further units seemed \nto be moving to Sumatra. All this suggested that Sukarno was \nnot yet finished. Negotiations were getting nowhere, and the \nonly serious rebellion inside Indonesia, on the island of Celebes, \nhad suffered a setback. Sukarno was known to be ill, and opti\u00ad\nmistic officials hoped his death might be followed by an internal \nstruggle between the Army and the Indonesian Communist Party. \nThe intelligence from SIS was that 'Sukarno may die at any \ntime. Without an operation he is unlikely to last more than a \nyear.' In fact the Indonesian Premier seemed to be in alarm\u00ad\ningly rude health, and the British Ambassador in Jakarta was \nsceptical about 'secret sources' on this subject.75 Although there \nhad been an abortive coup in September 1965, Sukarno was \nstill clinging on, and by the end of the year the British Chiefs \nof Staff were considering serious military escalation, including \nmuch deeper Claret operations and commando raids into \nSumatra.76 The British effort now developed a significant naval \ncomponent, with no less than a third of the entire British fleet \ndeployed off Sumatra, often operating openly in Indonesian \nwaters. Once again, signals intercepts were a crucial element in \nthe naval campaign.77 \n168 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nKonfrontasi ended after Sukarno was replaced by General \nSuharto in 1966. Cheyne argued that this change was partly \nprompted by British military successes: 'Sukarno would not have \nbeen deposed except for his military failures in Borneo.' He \nadded that once Sukarno had been overthrown, the Claret oper\u00ad\nations enabled Malaysia to negotiate from strength. Overall, he \nconcluded, it was 'a brilliantly successful story'.78 \nFor much of this period a stream of high-grade diplomatic \nsigint from Indonesia passed across the British Prime Minister \nHarold Wilson's desk, providing an accurate barometer of the \nthinking in the Indonesian capital of lakarta.79 For Denis Healey, \nBritain's Secretary for Defence, it was especially satisfying. On \n30 May 1965 he had a conversation with the American Defense \nSecretary, Robert McNamara, and explained that Britain could \nnot disengage from its commitments east of Suez until the \nConfrontation came to an end. McNamara had replied gloomily, \n'It will not end: But he was wrong.80 \nAlthough the Indonesians did not rumble the secret of sigint, \nthey knew something was badly wrong. Senior officers believed \nthat the British had some sort of special radar equipment that \ncould track their patrols, and this was not a bad guess.8l The \nsuccess of sigint in Borneo offered a longer-term legacy. The \nBritish and Australians had developed a new kind of sigint that \ninterfaced directly with special forces in real time. In 1966, when \nAustralia sent a Task Force to Vietnam, this was accompanied \nby a similar signals intelligence unit.82 The same tactics were \ndeployed by Britain in Northern Ireland in the 1970s. This \napproach has since become more commonplace, with the \nAmericans taking it to a new level with the elite Intelligence \nSupport Activity created in the 1980s, which was mostly deployed \nagainst terrorists. Britain's new Special Reconnaissance Regiment, \nformed in 2004, continues the tradition with its units of 'suit\u00ad\ncase men' who undertake short-range sigint, fully integrated \nwith tactical operations. Few remember that the SAS-sigint part\u00ad\nnership in the jungles of Borneo was its first proving ground.83 \n9 \nBlake, Bugs and the Berlin Tunnel \n... you cannot speak in the residences, town or country, put at \nour disposal. Every room is 'wired'. You cannot speak in a car, \nor train, or even outside the house if it be a small compound \nor garden. There is a danger of the apparatus picking up what \nyou say. \nHarold Macmillan, diary of his official visit to Moscow, \nFebruary-March 19591 \nSignals intelligence was delivering effective support to British \npolicy in the Third World during the 1950s and 1960s. The new \nrealm of elint was busy measuring radars and rockets around \nthe perimeter of the Soviet Union. However, GCHQ had stalled \nbadly against high-grade Soviet cyphers, the most prestigious \ntarget. William Weisband's treachery in the 1940s had inflicted \nsevere damage on almost all available streams of Soviet commu\u00ad\nnication. In 1952 GCHQ had been given a substantial tranche \nof extra money to accelerate its work. Much of this had been \nthrown at the 'Russian problem' in the hope of returning to \nthe glory days of Ultra, but the work went slowly. The code\u00ad\nbreakers were left grubbing their way through low-grade Soviet \nadministrative systems in the hope of picking up fragments of \nuseful information, or else reading Soviet intentions reflected \nin the traffic of other countries that Moscow was conversing \nwith. Alternative routes to sigint on the Soviet Union were \nbadly needed. \nThh was a direct spur for the now famous tunnel operations \nunder Vienna and Berlin launched by Britain's SIS in partner\u00ad\nship with the CIA. The CIA's own secret history of the Berlin \ntunnel operation makes it clear that these schemes were a direct \nresponse to the calamitous loss of sigint on Black Friday. 'As \nearly as 1948,' it noted, 'Intelligence Officers became interested \n170 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nin the benefits to be derived from tapping Soviet and Satellite \nlandlines on a scale not previously considered necessary. The \nloss of certain sources during this period created gaps in our \nintelligence coverage which were particularly unfortunate during \nthis period of Cold War escalation.' By tapping into telephone \nlines, the West hoped to pick up sensitive voice traffic that the \nSoviets were not troubling to encrypt, because unlike messages \nsent by radio transmitter, underground landlines were thought \nto be inaccessible and therefore secure.2 \nThe idea of tapping phone lines in Vienna and Berlin mirrored \nexisting activities by the KGB. As early as October 1946, the \nBritish Control Commission in Germany had reviewed the \ntwenty-two 'secrephones' or scrambler phones installed in Berlin \nfor communication with the British Zone of Germany, and had \nfound them wanting. The encypherment provided by the scram\u00ad\nbler was weak, and with the telephone lines passing through \nthe Soviet Zone, they were presumed to be tapped. Even within \nthe British Zone, the military had been anxious about allowing \nGermans who worked in telephone exchanges to have access \nto military telephone directories, since this would give them a \n'comprehensive guide to the most profitable extensions on which \nto listen in'. Only specially screened Germans were put to work \nin the telephone exchanges.3 \nPoor telephone security had the potential to blow high-grade \nBritish cyphers. For example, it had long been known that the \ndirect telephone line between the British element of the Allied \nCommission for Austria and London was monitored by the \nSoviets, and in early February 1948 British intelligence had \ndiscovered that they were 'strengthening their interception \narrangements'. The problem was that although officials in the \nBritish headquarters in Vienna were given continual security \nwarnings, the officials they were talking to in London were less \ndiligent. Frequently, telephone conversations were about \nagreeing the final text of a document, which was then sent by \ntelegram in a high-grade cypher. For the Soviet code-breakers \nthis was a gift, since they now had both the encyphered text \nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 171 \nand the clear text.4 By 4 August 1949, John Bruce Lockhart, \nthe head of SIS in Germany, was confident that the Soviets had \n'100% coverage of the telephone lines between Berlin and the \nWestern Zones'.5 \nPredictably, SIS had already launched its own offensive activ\u00ad\nities. The first operation took place in Austria, which like \nGermany was under four-power occupation. In late 1948 an \nSIS officer at the Vienna station, Peter Lunn, happened to notice \nthat the main telephone cables running under the British sector \nwent out towards a major headquarters in the Soviet Zone. A \ntwenty-foot tunnel code-named 'Conflict' was soon dug from \na British police post to the underground cable, and an engineer \nwas brought in from the Post Office Research Station at Dollis \nHill to attach a tapping device. SIS was reluctant to tell the \nForeign Office what it was doing, and so only informed the \nlocal Foreign Office Head of Mission, Harold Caccia. \nConveniently, Caccia had recently been Chairman of the JIe, \nand so was favourably disposed. 'Conflict' was so successful that \ntwo other tunnels were dug, code-named 'Sugar' and 'Lord'. \nOne reached out from the basement of a British-run jewellery \nstore, the other from a villa in the suburbs of Vienna occupied \nby a British Army officer and his wife.6 \nThe volume of illicit recordings and intercepts from these \nthree tunnels was so great that SIS's Section N, which handled \ntelephone transcripts from routine taps on foreign embassy tele\u00ad\nphones, was overwhelmed. SIS had to set up an entirely new \nsection called 'Section Y' at 2 Carlton Gardens, just off Pall Mall, \nstaffed partly by former East European exiles and with units for \ntranscription, translation and analysis.7 SIS was now desperate \nfor Russian linguists, and brought together a motley crew. Some \nwere retired British officers, going back as far as the Boer War. \nThere were many emigre Poles, including a dashing cavalry \nofficer with an eyepatch, and plenty of White Russians. They \nwere joined by recent trainees in Russian, but the latter strug\u00ad\ngled with the language of the intercepts, which was not only \nvery colloquial, but filled with obscenities. The lexicon that was \n172 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \neventually produced to assist the newcomers was classified 'Top \nSecret Obscene'.8 \nIn 1953 Peter Lunn was chosen to head the vast SIS station \nin Berlin, housed in the splendid Olympic Stadium. \nUnsurprisingly, he soon decided to repeat his Viennese activi\u00ad\nties. This time full Foreign Office clearance was easy to obtain \nbecause of the flow of wonderful material already coming from \nVienna. In contrast to Vienna, the Americans were invited in \nat the outset of the Berlin operation. This was partly because \nof a desire to share costs, but also because of the existence of \nan ideal building close to the Soviet telephone cables, located \nin the American sector.9 The whole operation was a tightly \ncompartmentalised Anglo-American affair. Few officers in the \nhuge CIA or SIS stations in Berlin knew of the tunnel's exis\u00ad\ntence, although back in London a CIA officer was made deputy \nhead of Section Y, which specifically looked after the tunnel. 10 \nBerlin was a superb place to collect Soviet comint. Its phone \nlines carried communications not only to Moscow, but also \nWarsaw and Bucharest. Although the operation was complex, \nthe underlying hope was that once in place, it might go on \nundisturbed for a long time. \nSIS agents in the East Berlin Post Office provided maps of \nthe locations of the cables, and in February 1954 digging began \nin earnest. Vitally important was the installation of the taps \nthemselves, which consisted of heavy metal clips. This involved \nfreezing the lines to prevent the interference being detected in \nthe East, a ticklish phase that was again carried out by a special \nDollis Hill Post Office research team. Finally, at the end of \nFebruary 1955, the Berlin tunnel was operational. Elaborate \nanti-humidity barriers had to be erected to prevent damp \naffecting the electronics. The CIA maintained a small local unit \nfor on-the-spot monitoring of circuits for the protection of the \nproject and also to provide items of 'hot' intelligence for Berlin. 11 \nThe overall 'take' from the Berlin tunnel was vast, and far \nexceeded the capacity of any local monitoring. Some twenty\u00ad\neight telegraphic circuits and 121 voice circuits were being moni-\nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 173 \ntored ilt anyone time. Voice traffic was recorded on fifty thou\u00ad\nsand reels of magnetic tape, amounting to twenty-five tons of \nmaterial. At the peak of operation the voice processing centre \nat Chester Terrace, overlooking Regent's Park in London, \nemployed 317 people, and eventually 368,000 conversations \nwere transcribed. The teletype processing centre employed a \nfurther 350 people. For each day of the tunnel's operation the \noutput was four thousand feet of teletype messages. Western \nintelligence services considered it to be a key source of early \nwarning of attack. There was excellent material on Khrushchev's \ndenunciation of Stalin in 1956, and tantalising information \nabout Soviet efforts to process uranium for their nuclear \nprogrammeY Several hundred officers of the KGB and of their \nsister service, the GRU or Soviet military intelligence, were also \nidentified. The tunnel was exposed by the Soviets on 21 April \n1956, little more than a year after its activation, as a result of \nthe treachery of George Blake, an SIS officer working for the \nSoviets. Nevertheless, the processing of the vast haul of intelli\u00ad\ngence material the West had already captured went on until \n30 September 1958.13 \nThese gloomy subterranean activities shine a surprisingly bright \nlight on the intelligence services of both East and West. In partic\u00ad\nular they illuminate a jealous rivalry. Some CIA officers have \nsuggested that the British initially decided not to tell the \nAmericans about their early tunnel operation in Vienna, and \nthat SIS only came clean when the Americans arrived at the \nidea independently, forcing the British to reveal their own solo \noperation. Later, it has been claimed, the Americans failed to \nadmit to the British that they could read certain types of the \ntraffic taken from Berlin, using a technique called 'Tempest', \nwhich allowed them to hear the faint echoes of plain text as \nmessages were tapped out on keyboards -although this story \nis unverified. What is quite clear is that while data was freely \nshared, its sheer volume sometimes defeated analysis. The quan\u00ad\ntity of traffic was immense. Overall, forty thousand hours of \n174 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ntelephone conversations were recorded, and six million hours \nof teletype traffic we\u00b7e taken. Entire buildings full of translators \nbattled to stay ahead of the wave, but inevitably fell behind.14 \nAstoundingly, this was partly because the CIA decided it \nwould rather fall behind than work with its main rival, NSA. \nThe CIA did not tell NSA about the Berlin tunnel. Indeed, it \nwas running an entire rival sigint unit called 'Staff D' in parallel \nwith its compatriots at Fort Meade, led by a code-breaker they \nhad poached called Frank Rowlett.15 NSA's Director, General \nRalph Canine, first found out about the Berlin tunnel by reading \nof its exposure by the Soviets on the front page of the New York \nTimes in late April 1956. He literally shouted with anger when \nhe realised the extent of the CIA intrusion into what he consid\u00ad\nered to be NSA turf. The two chiefs, Allen Dulles and Canine, \nnurtured an intense personal dislike, and the bitterness between \nNSA and the CIA lasted for years.16 Even in the 1970s the CIA \nstill had numerous rival intercept operations spread around the \nworld.17 \nAnother person who was angered when the tunnel hit the \nheadlines in April 1956 was the Berlin SIS Chief, Peter Lunn. \nThe Western press hailed the tunnel as a brilliant intelligence \nsuccess, and heaped praise on the CIA. Neither the Soviets nor \nthe American newspapers mentioned the British, despite the \nfact that the tunnel was packed with their equipment. This was \ntoo much for Lunn, who assembled the whole staff of the Berlin \nSIS station and recounted the story from beginning to end. IS \nEverybody seemed to love the so-called 'espionage tunnel'. In \nEast Berlin, British officials reported, it had been 'turned into \na major tourist attraction and scarcely a day passes without a \ndelegation of one sort or another being conducted through it'.19 \nIn private, they noted, the Soviets admired the craftsmanship \nand the quality of the equipment.2o \nThe Berlin tunnel is perhaps the most controversial intelli\u00ad\ngence operation of the 1950s. Much of the controversy stems \nfrom the fact that on 22 October 1953, even before its construc\u00ad\ntion began, George Blake, an SIS officer working for the KGB \nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 175 \nas a double agent, was part of a team briefed about the planned \ntunnel. Blake had been captured by the North Koreans in 1950, \nand was recruited during his incarceration. On his release he \nhad returned to duty and had been sent to work for Section Y, \nwhich was undertaking the tunnel operation. In early 1954 he \nhanded over the complete plans of the tunnel to his KGB \ncontroller during a rendezvous on the top deck of a London \nbus. Yet, incredibly, despite this leak, the tunnel was still a \nsuccess, and gathered good intelligence. The KGB had to allow \nthe operation to continue uninterrupted in order to protect \nBlake's cover as a top 'agent in place'.2l For the same reason, \nthe KGB did not warn Eastern Bloc officials who were routing \ncommunications through Berlin. This included the GRU, which \nwas responsible for Soviet Army intelligence operations. It \ndecided that the tap would be endured for a year, and then \n'accidentally' discovered in April 1956. In the meantime it passed \nout general security warnings to bureaucrats about using tele\u00ad\nphones, but to the KGB's dismay, most officials ignored them.22 \nOn the night of 21-22 April 1956, engineers in the East \npretended to bump into the tunnel while repairing damage \ncaused by heavy rain. Clearly there were other tunnels of this \nsort: recently declassified CIA documents reveal that in \nSeptember 1953 'similar operations' (in the plural) were being \n'conducted elsewhere'. Eventually, audacious operations of this \nkind were carried out by the West underneath Moscow itself.23 \nThe KGB's selfish behaviour towards the GRU during the \nBerlin tunnel episode mirrored the attitude of the CIA towards \nNSA. Protection of its own security and its own sources was \nparamount. Unusually, in the Berlin tunnel episode, both sides \ncould claim victory. The KGB successfully protected Blake until \nhe was exposed by a Polish intelligence officer working for the \nAmericans in 1959, while the West gained enormous quanti\u00ad\nties of data about its Eastern Bloc military opponents. Both sides \nwere offered some reassurance against the possibility that its \nenemies were planning a surprise attack. In that sense at least, \nCold War intelligence was neither fruitless nor necessarily a \n176 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \ncause of increased tensions. Collectively, these operations calmed \neveryone's fears, and their most substantial benefits might be \nmeasured through greater stability and the perpetuation of an \nuneasy peace.24 \nOddly, the Blake case seems to have helped, not harmed, \nAnglo-American intelligence relations, owing to the sensitive \nway it was handled by the Director of the CIA, Allen Dulles. \nOn his retirement in September 1961, Dick White, the Chief of \nSIS, thanked Dulles for his generous attitude, saying: 'This was \nnever more manifest than in your recent handling of the Blake \ncase. I only hope that you yourself realise what a splendid \nimpression you made upon us all by your magnanimity and \nunderstanding of our difficulties.' There were, White noted, \nmany other incidents in which Dulles' intervention had 'restored \ntrust and confidence between US'.25 In fact, by this time the \nhorrors of the Blake case had been overshadowed by the defec\u00ad\ntion of William H. Martin and Bernon F. Mitchell, two American \nNSA civilians who turned up in the Soviet Union in August \n1960. Mitchell was a distinctly odd person who had once \nadmitted to sexually experimenting with dogs and chickens, but \nhad still been allowed to pass his NSA vetting. After their defec\u00ad\ntion, GCHQ was informed and the usual damage assessments \nwere set in train. Although Martin and Mitchell blew a number \nof GCHQ's operations, and talked about them publicly at a \nMoscow press conference, the British reaction was muted. There \nwas general relief that, for once, the defectors were not British\u00ad\nemployed.26 \nThe Berlin tunnel was part of a general explosion of bugging \nand telephone tapping in the 1950s. Both SIS and the KGB saw \nthis as a way to get around the problem of highly secure encryp\u00ad\ntion and listen in to the enemy. The Soviets led the way on \nbugging because of their long history of listening in on Western \ndiplomatic premises in Moscow.27 In July 1950 the Air Attache \nat the British Embassy in Moscow was testing a wireless receiver \nwhen he heard the voice of the Naval Attache, who was in a \nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 177 \nnearby room, broadcasting loud and clear. Despite a painstaking \nsearch, no bug could be found. The general opinion was that \nRussian employees within the Embassy had quickly removed \nit. Now the hunt was OIl, and the 'sweepers' who searched for \nbugs were busy all over Moscow. In January 1952 a micro\u00ad\nphone was found in the American Embassy. Then in September \nof the same year an American sweeper heard the voice of George \nKennan, the American Ambassador, being transmitted, but no \none could find the offending bug. Painstaking work with a British \ndetector eventually located it.28 Its sophistication stunned \nWestern observers: it was a resonating device that required no \nexternal power supply, and so could remain in operation indef\u00ad\ninitely. Consisting of a metal chamber about ten inches long, it \ntransmitted when bombarded with microwaves from a nearby \nbuilding and was hidden in a wooden model of the Great Seal \nof the United States which was on display in Kennan's office \nand which had been given to him by the Soviets as a present. \nIn order to persuade the Soviets to activate the device, Kennan \npretended to dictate a telegram, which enabled the sweepers to \nhome in on it. Kennan recalls that he felt 'acutely conscious of \nthe unseen presence'.29 \nThe discovery of this microwave bug triggered alarm in \nLondon. On 9 October 1952 Churchill urged MI5 and SIS to \n'take all necessary action', and told A.V. Alexander, his Defence \nSecretary, that the episode was 'most important' as it showed \n'how far the Soviets have got in this complex sphere'. He ordered \nan active programme of research into both defensive security \nmeasures and offensive bugging techniques for Britain's own \nuse. In the short term, MI5 busied itself protecting certain key \nrooms in Whitehall. Meanwhile, Sir Frederick Brundrett, the \nChief Scientific Adviser at the Ministry of Defence, was asked \nto coordinate technical investigations into bugging possibilities \nfor SIS, particularly with new transistor-based devices. Since \nthe original find of an advanced Soviet bug in Britain's Moscow \nEmbassy in 1950, three different scientists in Britain had already \n'developed miniature devices which would transmit voices in \n178 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nthe room in which they are. All the devices are different in \nprinciple from that discovered in Moscow: It was now neces\u00ad\nsary to move from laboratory prototypes into the field, for \nMinisters in London called for 'devices suitable for offensive \naction by ourselves'.3o By July 1954, Brundrett's group had four \nprototype bugs ready for field trials by SIS operatives.3l \nWhy were the new audio bugs being rushed ahead, when the \nfamiliar and reliable techniques of telephone tapping had been \naround for years? One of the reasons is that Soviet telephone \nsecurity discipline was good. George Blake illustrates this well \nwith his recollections of the efforts of the SIS Y Section to tap \nSoviet and Chinese telephones during the Geneva Peace \nConference of May 1954. This important conference sought a \nsettlement to the wars in Korea and Vietnam, and set up the \nInternational Control Commission on Vietnam, consisting of \nobservers from India, Poland and Canada. SIS sent a team to \nGeneva headed by Blake, with two translators, who worked with \nthe enthusiastic support of the Swiss security service. They were \nset up in the suburbs of Geneva with two recording machines \nand a few desks. However, it was soon clear that no hot tips \nwere going to reach Anthony Eden, the British Foreign Secretary, \nand his negotiating team: 'The Staff of the Communist delega\u00ad\ntions observed strict telephone security. They never discussed \nanything with even a remote bearing on their position and tactics \nat the negotiating table, or gave any inkling of what concessions \nthey were prepared to make: If such information was going to \nbe scooped it was only going to happen when diplomats thought \nthey were at a safe distance from a phone, which they had been \ntrained to look upon as akin to a venomous serpent.32 \nThe Y Section excursion to Geneva was far from valueless. \nSIS was amazed to see how the Soviet and Chinese Communist \ndelegations dealt with each other on the basis of complete \nequality. No less interesting were the family conversations of the \nfamously stem and unbending Soviet Foreign Minister, \nVyacheslav Molotov. To the surprise of the secret listeners, \nMolotov enjoyed long and patient chats with his six-year-old \nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 179 \ngrandson, who recounted his daily school activities. One evening \nMrs Molotov complained that her best friend's son was having \ndifficulty getting a place at Moscow University. 'Could he ring \nthe rector and arrange it? Rather grudgingly, Molotov \nconsented:33 One wonders if, at this point, Blake ever paused \nto reflect that the Soviet Communist system that he admired \nand the British system were really not so very different. SIS \ngathered plenty of such 'social intelligence', since Blake recalls \nthat during the mid-1950s his unit also bugged Polish diplomatic \npremises in Brussels, the Soviet Embassy in Copenhagen, the \nBulgarian Embassy in London and numerous locations in Cairo.34 \nThe Soviets got some of their own back in late February 1959, \nwhen Prime Minister Harold Macmillan made an official visit \nto Moscow. He recorded his main impressions in his diary, noting \nfor example that 'Mr Khrushchev is the absolute ruler of Russia \nand completely controls the situation.' He then added: \n* The second impression -dominating everything else -was \nthe strange experience of being surrounded by friends and \nadvisers ... and yet being practically unable to communi\u00ad\ncate with them at all, by word or writing, except in one \nroom in the Embassy in conditions of great discomfort, inside \na plastic tent with a gramophone record playing continu\u00ad\nously. This is because you cannot speak in the residences, \ntown or country, put at our disposal. Every room is 'wired'. \nYou cannot speak in a car, or train, or even outside the \nhouse if it be a small compound or garden. There is a danger \nof the apparatus picking up what you say. \n* Even in the British Embassy, Macmillan continued, the Soviet \nmethods were so good and so unobtrusive that there could be \n'no security'. He observed that diplomats who remained in \nMoscow a long time either gradually came to disregard the \nproblem or became 'very irritable and nervy'. He concluded that \nno British Ambassador should endure this post for more than \nthree years.35 \n180 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nBugs and telephone taps were also being found by the \nAmericans with increasing frequency. In early 1956, regular \nsweeping picked up bugs in the offices of the US Ambassadors \nin Tel Aviv and Belgrade. Something more troubling was found \nin the conference room at the headquarters of US Europe \nCommand, the main forum where American plans for the defence \nof Europe were discussed. Sweepers were picking up sound \nemanations that suggested the room was compromised, but could \nnot find any bugs. Then they checked the telephones in the \nheadquarters. To their dismay, the first fourteen they examined \n'were found to be equipped with jumper circuits which kept the \ntelephones alive when the receivers remained in their cradles'. \nIn other words, even when the telephones were not in use, they \noperated as active microphones, hoovering up all the sounds in \ntheir vicinity.36 By 1960 more than a hundred devices had been \nfound in American diplomatic premises in the Eastern Bloc. The \nresponse was to construct 'clean rooms', often containing an \ninner room made of Perspex, which was supposedly bug-proof.37 \nWhen Jackie Kennedy, the wife of the American President, \nmet the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the Vienna \nSummit of 1961, they chatted amiably about the recent Soviet \nspace programme and the emerging 'space race'. At this early \nstage, animals rather than humans were being sent into orbit. \nKhrushchev revealed that Strelka, a dog the Soviets had recently \nsent into space and returned safely to earth, had just produced \npuppies. Half-jokingly, Mrs Kennedy asked if she might have one \nof the puppies for her daughter Caroline. Some weeks later a \npuppy, called Pushinka (Fluffy), duly arrived at the White House, \ntogether with a photograph album of Moscow and a gold tea\u00ad\nset. The security men insisted on checking the puppy very thor\u00ad\noughly indeed, for fear that it had been implanted with miniature \nlistening devices.38 This seeming paranoia was not entirely without \nfoundation. In May 1964, sensitive new equipment enabled the \nAmericans to find bugs in almost every room in their Moscow \nEmbassy, except for the specially constructed 'clean room'.39 \n* * * \nBLAKE, BUGS AND THE BERLIN TUNNEL 181 \nImprobably, the sharp end of British bugging technology was the \nsleepy suburb of Borehamwood. Tucked away amongst the mock\u00ad\nTudor dwellings of north London was a most peculiar Foreign \nOffice factory employing four hundred people. The location was \nthe small Chester Road Industrial Estate. Few of the local resi\u00ad\ndents knew what happened here; they were only conscious of a \ntwelve-foot-high barbed wire fence patrolled by aggressive \nAlsatian dogs.40 In the mid-1950s the site was run by Lieutenant \nColonel Robert Hornby, who had been chief engineer for a \ncommercial radio company, Philco, before the war, and then head \nof the technical ~ide of SIS's wartime Section VIII radio unit at \nWhaddon HallY The secret factory had been acquired on a lease \ntaken out privately by Brigadier Gambier-Parry, who had trans\u00ad\nformed SIS's Section VIII into the Diplomatic Wireless Service, \nand was financed through private bank accounts.42 Even Edward \nBridges, one of the denizens of the British secret state, regarded \nthis as 'a pretty queer sort of set-up'.43 Although it was formally \nknown as 'Department B', the intelligence officers who frequented \nthe discreet factory at 4 Chester Road knew it simply as the 'bug \nshop'. Their work tended to reflect world events. The build-up \nto the Suez Crisis had resulted in a high demand for bugs, and \nin October 1956 officials noted, 'This year the Factory has been \nkept fully occupied because in addition to the forecast programme \nof production it has had many short term demands on it arising \nout of the political crisis in the Middle East.' To keep a steady \nflow of work they had also put in bids for outside work, such as \ndevelopment contracts for specialist comsec equipment required \nby the London Communications Security Agency.44 \nBritish eavesdropping received a boost in June 1957, when \nDick White successfully pressed the Chiefs of Staff to assist with \nan accelerated programme of bugging Soviet premises. 'Orthodox \nmethods of obtaining intelligence were particularly ineffective \nagainst totalitarian states,' he explained, because it was so hard \nto run human agents in these countries, 'and consequently some \nnew method of \"breaking through\" was essential.' On the defen\u00ad\nsive side there was also the danger of falling behind the Soviets. \n182 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nRoger Hollis, the Director General of MI5, was enthusiastic to \nmake progress in this area, and noted that the costs would be \nmodest compared to the possible gain. Much of the staff for this \nnew effort would come from the Royal Naval Scientific Service, \nwhich worked closely with GCHQY By the summer of 1958, \nas a result of all this activity, the 'bug shop' at Borehamwood \nwas undergoing further expansion.46 \nOffensive bugging brought SIS many scoops during the 1950s. \nHowever, bugging also presented a huge defensive problem, and \nby the late 1950s Britain was overwhelmed. The main defence \nforce was the Fcreign Office Technical Maintenance Service at \nHanslope Park just outside Milton Keynes. This was the head\u00ad\nquarters of a unit of sweepers who prowled around Britain's \nembassies searching for bugs, using electronic scanners that \nlooked like brooms connected to a suitcase. However, the Soviets \nwere 'devoting considerable scientific resources to developing \nnew devices', and these could only be found with increased \neffort. Hitherto, only high-risk locations had been swept, but \nafter the Suez Crisis it was felt that embassies in the Middle \nEast and Africa needed more attention. By January 1957, bugs \nwere turning up everywhere. 'Listening devices have been found \nin our Embassy in Spain, and there is evidence,' it was noted, \n'that devices may have been planted on us in Sweden.' \nMoreover, Britain was receiving increasing requests to help allied \ngovernments with whom it was sharing sensitive materia1.47 \nSIS's knowledge of Soviet bugs came not only from physical \nexamples, but also from the interrogation of German scientists \nwho had been employed on bugging projects in Russia, and had \nexcellent knowledge of the most advanced methods of elec\u00ad\ntronic surveillance.48 Embassies were the new front line in a \nbizarre battle that involved every conceivable kind of technical \ndevice. Here SIS and GCHQ were now working alongside other \ncovert British groups whose activities still remain mysterious.49 \n10 \nEmbassy Wars \nThis file shows the covert activities of the DWS [Diplomatic Wireless \nService} which must not be revealed ... \nD.H. Jones, Treasury, weeder's note on filel \nIn early April 1952 an off-duty MI5 'watcher' was alighting from \na bus not far from London's Oxford Street when he spotted a \nregular surveillance target. This was Pavel Kuznetsov, notionally \na 'Second Secretary' at the Soviet Embassy in Kensington, but \nin fact well known to be an intelligence officer. Whether he was \nKGB or GRU, MI5 was not sure. It had mounted routine surveil\u00ad\nlance on him, but his tradecraft was good and he often gave the \nwatchers the slip. Today, confident he was not being tailed, he \nwas in animated conversation with an unknown British person. \nThe MI5 watcher duly followed discreetly and reported all he \nhad seen. Soon a major surveillance operation on Kuznetsov was \nlaunched. The British were about to receive a very direct warning \nof how keen Moscow was to penetrate their cyphers. \nMI5 employed over a hundred 'watchers', who mostly supported \nits counter-espionage branch -known as B Division. Their task \nwas to follow Soviet intelligence officers as they moved around \nLondon in what was often an elaborate game of cat and mouse. \nA key objective was to identify the British people the KGB \ncontacted, in the certain knowledge that some of them would be \nengaged in espionage. Accordingly, on 25 April 1952, a team of \nMI5 watchers were waiting for Pavel Kuznetsov as he left his \nhouse. A lengthy pursuit developed. Kuznetsov was obviously \ngoing to great lengths to 'dry-clean' himself of any surveillance. \n184 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nHis greatest ally was the familiar red Routemaster bus: his preferred \ntechnique was to stand on the open platform at the back of the \nbus, allowing him to jump on and off unexpectedly, putting the \nMIS team through their paces. The watchers noted that it would \nhave been 'sheer folly' to board the same buses as Kuznetsov, so \nthey followed standard MIS procedure and tried to use taxis, but \non this day there were none to be found. Nevertheless, they \nfollowed Kuznetsov as he traced a circuitous journey through the \nWest End, using four different buses and eventually heading out \nthrough Hammersmith towards Kew Gardens. \nAll morning, Kuznetsov was ahead of them. MIS took the \nbus after his to Mortlake, but the experienced KGB field officer \nhad outwitted them. Dispirited after frantically searching the \nstreets, they moved on, again by bus, with little hope of finding \ntheir elusive target. To their amazement, as they passed through \nRichmond, Kuznetsov boarded their bus. The jubilant watchers \nrecounted: 'He came aboard and sat not very far away panting \nand breathing heavily ... shaking off his pursuers was indeed \nmost strenuous work.' He got off at Marble Hill Park in \nTwickenham. After a period of calculated inactivity reading the \nnewspaper on a park bench to watch out for pursuers, he made \nvarious 'excursions into back streets' before boarding yet another \nbus to Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey. Here he finally met \nwith a nervous-looking figure outside the Century-Elite cinema \nin Kingston High Street. The British man was in his twenties, \nwith a pinched face, dressed in a mackintosh and distinctive \nyellow socks. The pair went for a meal in the cafe of Bentalls \ndepartment store. Afterwards they walked to a secluded part of \nCanbury Gardens, where they would be able to see anyone who \napproached, and so felt safe enough to exchange information. \nThe unknown man produced a large sheet of paper from his \ninside pocket, and Kutznetsov took detailed notes for an hour \nand a half. Whenever a passer-by approached they put their \npapers away. Kuznetsov's MIS followers were still watching.2 \nWhen the clandestine meeting in Kingston finished, MIS's \ntask had only just begun. The crucial part of the operation was \nEMBASSY WARS 185 \nto follow Kuznetsov's unknown British contact, to identify who \nwas passing information to the KGB. The man had no street\u00ad\ncraft, and was easily tailed to an address in Elborough Street at \nEarlsfield in Wandsworth. MI5 kept watch, and also engaged in \nletter interception. The contact was soon revealed to be William \nMarshall, a Radio Operator for the Diplomatic Wireless Service \n(DWS), the radio network at Hanslope Park that the Foreign \nOffice had inherited from SIS at the end of the war.3 Although \nMarshall had only joined the DWS in November 1948, he had \nundertaken some interesting work. Having been trained in the \nRoyal Signals imr.lediately after the war, he did eight months \nof duty at Hanslope and was then sent to the British Embassy \nin Cairo. SIS had just moved its offices, induding its transmit\u00ad\nters, from the Cairo Embassy to the military headquarters at \nIsmailia. Because SIS was short of Radio Operators, DWS lent \nit three of its people, induding Marshall. His next posting was \nthe British Embassy in Moscow, where he spent a year between \nDecember 1950 and December 1951.4 \nMarshall had almost certainly been recruited by the KGB \nduring his sojourn in Moscow. The Security Department of the \nForeign Office, run by William Carey-Foster, began to make \nbackground enquiries. Carey-Foster asked British diplomats in \nMoscow for information, asking whether there was anything \nodd about Marshall. One of the diplomats there offered a frank \nand revealing reply: \n* Marshall was a perfect example of the type who should \nnot be sent here. He was an introvert, anti-social to a degree \nI have never seen before. At staff cocktail parties he would \nbe found in a corner behind a screen, if he turned up at \nall, or in some other obscure spot. He was most difficult \nto draw into conversation, and he had a meanness which \nit would be difficult to surpass. If asked to give a cigarette \nto a colleague, he would ask for a cigarette back the \nfollowing day. \n* \n186 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nHis main interests were embroidery and documentary films. \nAlthough there were dQubts about his mental state, his managers \ndid not have security concerns about him until his very last day \nin Moscow, when, having completed the DWS Radio Operator's \nstandard tour of twelve months, he was being sent home by \nthe evening train via Leningrad. He was relieved of his duties \nin order to pack, but went missing for most of the day. It tran\u00ad\nspired that he spent the entire day in Moscow. When challenged \nabout what he had been doing, he answered evasively.5 \nOne of MI5's worries was that Marshall might have gleaned \nsensitive information about intelligence and security activities \nthat were under way at Britain's Moscow Embassy. However, \nLambert Titchner, one of the diplomats there, thought it unlikely \nthat he had picked up anything about the recent KGB bugging \nof the British Naval Attache's office. Most importantly, the diplo\u00ad\nmats did not think he knew anything about the offensive sigint \nwork DWS conducted from the Moscow Embassy on behalf of \nGCHQ, which was referred to coyly as 'the watch on high\u00ad\nfrequency wave-lengths'. This was partly because they had \njudged him to be of low intelligence, and uninformed about \nsecret matters generally. This proved to be a miscalculation.6 \nIt turned out that Marshall was in London on leave visiting his \nparents in Southwell. Having returned from his tour in Moscow, \nhe was working on a routine radio watch at Hanslope. Like most \noperators he was living in a DWS hostel at Bletchley Park which \nhoused about seventy staff. The canteen and the hostel were used \nby both normal DWS Radio Operators and SIS operators. \nMI5 met Brigadier Richard Gambier-Parry, the head of DWS, \nand made arrangements to search Marshall's room at the hostel \nand to receive notification of when he had enough time off to \nmeet his KGB contacts. On 19 May 1952, MI5 tried to watch \na further rendezvous between him and Kuznetsov when they \nmet for lunch in a pub called the Dog and Fox in Wimbledon \nvillage. Kuznetsov was 'very much on the alert' for watchers, \nengaging in his usual counter-surveillance antics of running \nhard for buses and scrambling aboard, making him hard to taiP \nEMBASSY WARS 187 \nThere were other attempted meetings around south-west \nLondon at which MI5 thought Kuznetsov was even more aware \nof surveillance. Marshall was also developing his fieldcraft, and \non one occasion he artfully evaded his MI5 tail by boarding an \nunderground train at Euston, then jumping off just as the doors \nclosed.8 MI5 had to accept that the pair had probably managed \nseveral meetings they were unaware of, and wondered what \nsecrets Marshall was handing over. \nOn 10 June it was decided to arrest the pair at their next \nmeeting, in the hope that they would be in possession of \ncompromising dccuments, which would make a prosecution \neasier.9 The next day, Anthony Simkin from MI5 spoke with \nColonel Ted Maltby, the deputy head of DWS at Hanslope Park. \nThey knew Marshall was about to go on a few days' leave in \nLondon, and Simkin asked if the DWS could 'put out a docu\u00ad\nment that would appeal to Marshall'. As bait, they chose a \nbooklet giving new DWS frequencies and call signs.1O On 13 \nJune Marshall and Kuznetsov were arrested by Chief Inspector \nHughes of the Special Branch as they met in a park in \nWandsworth. They were taken to Wandsworth Police Station, \nand there was delight all round as they proved to be carrying \na wealth of incriminating material, including the deliberately \nproffered frequencies booklet. Kuznetsov was supposed to enjoy \ndiplomatic immunity, but in their excitement the police did not \nlisten to his protests and put him in a cell to cool off. \nOn 15 June, Dick White went in person to Chartwell, Winston \nChurchill's private residence, to brief him about the case. The \nPrime Minister was recovering from illness, and received White \nin his pyjamas, sitting up in bed. White emphasised that this \nwas not an isolated case, and that MI5 knew the Soviets had \nbeen 'very active in regard to British personnel in our Mission \nin Moscow'. He explained that when Kuznetsov was arrested \nhe was found to be carrying a notebook 'in which were entered \nthe index numbers of the cars used by our shadowing organi\u00ad\nsation', which the MI5 watchers believed showed his status as \na 'professional espionage agent'. 11 \n188 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nThe incriminating paperwork was vital. Although Marshall \nwas grilled by William Skardon, MIS's best interrogator, he did \nnot give much away. He was certainly not going to confess. \nProving that he had had meetings with Soviet agents was one \nthing, but producing hard evidence of espionage was the key. \nWhen MIS shared their information with the Americans, they \nimmediately asked the right question: namely, what evidence \ndid the British have that could be produced in court? MIS was \npretty confident that the cypher material Marshall had been \ncaught with would be enough, but it was busy hunting for \nmore. The results of its enquiries were suggesting that Marshall \nwas attracted to Communism even before he went to Moscow. \nA search of his room at Bletchley Park had produced Communist \nliterature, including a copy of From Trotsky to\u00b7 Tito by James \nKlugman, a leading Cambridge Marxist and friend of Anthony \nBluntY The head of the Foreign Office Security Department, \nWilliam Carey-Foster, had been casually strolling around \nBletchley asking questions. Remarkably, he had discovered that \nwhen Marshall was first working at Hanslope Park in 1948 he \nused to buy the Daily Worker, the newspaper of the British \nCommunist Party, every day from Turner's news agents in the \nvillage, which was close to his lodgings at Bletchley Park. \nApparently he confidentially arranged with the staff in the \nnews agents for the paper 'to be handed to him in such a way \nthat his colleagues would not become aware of his interest'Y \nFurther surprises awaited MIS. On 20 June it held a meeting \nwith Brigadier Gambier-Parry of DWS at Leconfield House, the \nMIS headquarters in London, to discuss protecting sensitive infor\u00ad\nmation during the coming court case. Some of the papers found \nin Marshall's possession at the time of his arrest referred to espe\u00ad\ncially secret SIS radio links used to contact its Moscow station. \nThe assembled company were amazed by this, since Marshall \nshould not have been able to come across such things in the \ncourse of his duties. Gambier-Parry was accompanied by Army \nsigint officers who explained that they were liaising closely with \nEric Jones, the new Director of GCHQ. They were very concerned \nEMBASSY WARS 189 \nthat Marshall's defence material in court might make 'reference \nto techniques such as those used by G.C.H.Q.', and explained \nthat during his time in the Royal Signals between 1946 and 1948 \nhe was 'engaged in the Middle East on \"intercept duties\" '. Jones \nurged that every effort be made to prevent this coming out in \ncourt. Remarkably, up until this point GCHQ had chosen to tell \nMI5 absolutely nothing about Marshall's earlier work on sigint.14 \nA few days later, Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden tried to assure \nChurchill that Marshall was not important, omitting any mention \nof the fact that he had been a sigint operator. 15 \nSecurity officials now began to probe Britain's Moscow \nEmbassy. Clearly already sympathetic towards Communism \nwhen he arrived in Moscow in 1950, it seems Marshall had \nbecome enamoured of Nina Michailovna Gredjeva, a Russian \ndomestic who waited tables in the Junior Mess in the Moscow \nEmbassy, where he ate. MI5 already knew of this woman, who \nwas considered attractive and had been instrumental in an \nattempt made by the Soviets to subvert another member of the \nDWS in Moscow, Leonard Douglas Ker, who eventually blew \nthe whistle and notified his superiors.161t was widely assumed \nthat she was a KGB 'swallow', an agent who specialised in using \nher personal charms to recruit foreign diplomatic officials. In \nany case, MI5 concluded that Soviet intelligence would have \nhad 'numerous opportunities to earmark, approach and recruit \nMarshall during his tour in Moscow' Y Contrary to the asser\u00ad\ntions of senior diplomats that Marshall was a loner, in fact he \nappeared to have had a close circle of like-minded friends in \nMoscow, including Jack Howarth, the Chancery Messenger, and \nAnthony Hibberson, another Radio Operator.18 Hibberson later \ntold MI5 that he was aware that Marshall 'had an unusually \nlarge number of books on sex matters in his possession'; indeed \nhe had been grateful to borrow some himself. However, he felt \nobliged to make the firm assertion that he 'did not consider that \nMarshall was a practising pervert of any kind', and did not feel \nthat this had any bearing on the case.19 \nIn June 1952 Marshall was tried at the Old Bailey. His plea \n190 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nof gUilty ensured that there was no exposure of embarrassing \nsigint secrets, and the grateful authorities sentenced him to a \nlenient five years' imprisonment.2o \nThe Marshall case underlines the fact that the Soviets were \nalmost certainly aware of the British practice of using DWS \noperators as an extended arm of GCHQ to undertake short\u00ad\nrange monitoring of communications from embassies.21 \nUnsurprisingly, the KGB was busy doing the same thing in \nLondon. Remarkably, one of Moscow's most valuable sigint \nassets in post-war Europe was not small or hidden, but was \nclear for all to see. During the Second World War, permission \nhad been given for the Soviet TASS News Agency to construct \na 'radio monitoring station' on the northern fringes of London. \nThis occupied 13 Oakleigh Park North, Whetstone, only a stone's \nthrowaway from the Foreign Office 'bug shop' in nearby \nBorehamwood. The station, with its substantial aerial farm, was \nstill in operation in July 19S1. Moreover, as a TASS Agency site \nit enjoyed full diplomatic immunity.22 Incredibly, Britain had \nprovided the Soviets with a large sigint site from which they \ncould conduct, with complete immunity, the illicit study of radio \nsystems, including those connected with the air defence of \nLondon. From Whetstone they could capture far more traffic \nthan from the Soviet Embassy in the centre of London. \nJohn Slessor, the Chief of the Air Staff, was especially agitated, \nand declared that Britain was 'gratuitously presenting our poten\u00ad\ntial enemy with ... information which he could not obtain from \nany number of spies'. Slessor wanted the station closed down, \nbut the Foreign Office and MIS could not agree on how much \nevidence of illicit activity they had, or what legal action could \nbe taken. Elint and radio warfare units from RAF Watton had \nbeen used to jam the station during a major RAF air exercise \nin the summer of 19S1. 'It is absolutely fantastic,' Slessor fulmi\u00ad\nnated, that 'we should continue to present the Soviets on a \nplate with the opportunity of learning such vital defence \nsecrets:23 Remarkably, Sir Percy Sillitoe, the Director of MIS, \nEMBASSY WARS 191 \nhad discovered that some of the twenty-nine staff labouring \naway at the monitoring station were British nationals employed \nby the Soviets.24 \nIn early August 1951 the Cabinet Defence Committee bit the \nbullet and decided that the station had to go. The Soviets resisted, \narguing that they had been given a special dispensation to run \nit by none other than King George VI in 1941. Diplomats found \nit more than a little amusing that Russian Communists should \nfall back on arguments derived from royal prerogative. The \nPermanent Under-Secretary's department that superintended \nintelligence affairs in the Foreign Office finally decided that \nprotocol and law were no longer an impediment, and that the \nimportant thing was to shut the station down.25 Firm orders to \ndepart were issued to the Soviets at the end of August, but they \ndragged their heels, only winding up their operations in \nSeptember when threatened with 'forcible action'.26 However, \nthey also had a residence in Ealing, and worries about 'forward \ninterception' by the KGB from this site continued into the late \n1950s.27 \nWest London was also the site of a new organisation created to \nprotect British cyphers. When GCHQ moved to Cheltenham in \nlate 1952, much of the technical business of cypher security \nremained at Eastcote. Fearsome rows developed with the armed \nservices, which complained about delays in the production of \ncypher equipment and scrambler phones, as well as their poor \nquality. T.R.W. Burton-Miller, who was in charge of communi\u00ad\ncations security, had done his best to achieve good relations \nwith the military. However, in 1953 many felt it was better to \nmake a fresh start by creating a completely new service, the \nLondon Communications Security Agency (LCSA). This deci\u00ad\nsion to separate communications security and sigint was contro\u00ad\nversial, but it was backed by the new GCHQ Director, Eric Jones, \nand one of his key subordinates, Joe Hooper.28 \nLCSA was effectively Britain's fourth secret service, the tech\u00ad\nnical security equivalent of MI5. Its main task was to develop \n192 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nnew and very secure cypher machines to produce better codes \nin the hope of thwarting the Soviet sigint services. Although it \nexisted for nearly two decades, almost nothing is known about \nit. Its first chief was Major General William Penney, who had \nbeen Mountbatten's Director of Intelligence in South-East Asia. \nPenney was familiar with sigint, but was definitely an outsider. \nWhile the technical staff for communications security remained \nat Eastcote and nearby Northwood Hills, Penney and his senior \nofficers moved into new premises at 8 Palmer Street, which \ndoubled as GCHQ's London office. Palmer Street was close to \none of the oldest underground stations in London, St James's \nPark, and to many of the embassies. Indeed, the warren of \ntunnels from the ancient station that ran under the LCSA \nbuilding soon gave rise to stories of secret passages and hidden \nbasement facilities.29 \nAt obscure locations such as Palmer Street and Hanslope Park, \ncommunications security experts were at the forefront of secret \nbattles between the embassies. DWS was both an offensive and \na defensive organisation, and was admired for what officials \ncalled its 'buccaneering' spirit. 30 As the Marshall case had \nrevealed, many of its operators acted as forward collectors for \nGCHQ, and one of its larger post-war stations, in Stockholm, \nwas often referred to as a GCHQ site.31 In fact, DWS combined \na multitude of curious tasks that were at the gritty interface of \ntechnical and human espionage or counter-espionage. By 1952 \nthey shared accommodation with the sweepers at Hanslope Park. \nThe old manor house was now surrounded by an unsightly \npenumbra consisting of forty nissen huts and concrete bunkers \non each side of the drive leading up to the main building. There \nwere acres of wireless masts, serving both SIS and the radio \nnets for the mainstream Foreign Office. All sorts of interesting \nthings went on there. A visiting MIS officer noted that the \noutlying huts and bunkers were a research and development \ncentre for many secret devices. 'Those near the manor and to \none side of it are used for research into offensive and defen\u00ad\nsive microphone techniques. Several near the end of the drive \nEMBASSY WARS 193 \nare used for the construction, testing and development of \nM.I.6 agent sets.'32 \n'Buccaneering' was the right term for this kind of work. In \nthe late 1950s and early J 960s, a new task for Britain's commu\u00ad\nnications security experts was protecting embassy code rooms \nagainst piratical raids by the enemy. The most sophisticated plot \nwas launched by the KGB in Moscow in the autumn of 1964, \nwhen a low-frequency radio beam was used to induce a malfunc\u00ad\ntion in a teleprinter in the code room of the British Embassy, \ncausing a small fire.33 Roderic Braithwaite, one of Britain's most \nsenior intelligence officials, recalls that within minutes the \nbuilding was 'surrounded by alleged Soviet firemen'; however, \nit was 'pretty obvious that some of these people were not firemen \nat all'. They were in fact bugging technicians from the KGB's \nsigint department, the highly secret Eighth Directorate. The \nAmbassador, Humphrey Trevelyan, was called out of a perform\u00ad\nance by the visiting English National Opera at a Moscow \ntheatre.34 He arrived at the Embassy to discover that the valiant \nBritish code-room staff had barricaded the door and were \nsuccessfully fighting off the 'furious' KGB firemen, while others \ntried to extinguish the fire. One of the KGB officers recalls that \nit was 'a real Mexican stand-off'. Privately, the KGB sigint team \nwere enormously impressed by this dedication to duty, and one \nof them later declared that it was a wonderful display of 'British \nstiff upper lip'. When the code room was rebuilt all the mat\u00ad\nerials, including the bricks and concrete, were brought out from \nBritain, sealed and guarded in diplomatic trucks.35 \nThere were even more serious problems for British diplomats \nin Mao Tse-tung's China. The country was undergoing a vast \npolitical convulsion known as the 'Cultural Revolution', a frenzy \nof extreme -almost anarchic -activity by radical student groups \nand self-appointed 'Red Guards'. In August 1967 they began \nattacking and ransacking diplomatic premises, including the \nBritish Embassy in Peking. Percy Cradock, the Ambassador, \nremembers the mob banging on the Embassy windows shouting \n194 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \n'Kill! Kill!' At one point the whole Embassy staff thought they \nwere going to be burned with petrol, but in the event they were \nmerely pulled out of the building and beaten. 'I was swept along \nby the mob,' recounts Cradock, 'and beaten mainly about the \nshoulders and back.' After they were released the staff were \nable to destroy classified papers that had survived in one of the \nstrong rooms. The Foreign Office security specialists had provided \nthem with 'a remarkable chemical compound' in the form of a \npowder that apparently only needed to be scattered on the files \nand left for a period in order to reduce them to ashes. They \nfollowed the instructions on the tin, and retreated to a safe \ndistance: \n* Unfortunately when we returned we found the files neatly \ncharred around the edges, rather like funeral stationery, \nbut still perfectly legible. And there was a side effect of \nwhich we had not been warned: powerful tenacious fumes \nhad been generated, turning the strong-room into an effec\u00ad\ntive gas-chamber. ~6 \n* The files were eventually taken out and burned by hand. \nHowever, the staff had been unable to protect the Embassy \nCommunications Centre, which contained cypher machines and \nmaterials. Only the generators survived intact.37 Mingled in with \nthe revolutionary mob was a specialist team of Chinese code \nexperts. An SIS officer stationed in Peking at the time recalls: \n'They knew exactly what they were looking for.'38 \nCommunications security experts in London later confirmed the \nChinese success, lamenting that they had acquired a Rockex, \none of Britain's top-grade post-war cypher machines.39 \nFollowing this attack, Britain routed its classified telegram \ntraffic to Peking through the nearby French Embassy. Although \nthe French were 'simply splendid', the duty cypher clerks at \nthe Quai d'Orsay in Paris struggled with the high volume of \ndaily traffic. The British also recognised that the French were \n'scared stiff of a leak', which might trigger Chinese revolutionary \nEMBASSY WARS 195 \naction against their Embassy in Peking. British Embassy staff in \nParis, who were part of the new conduit for telegrams to London, \ntook the precaution of never mentioning the matter on the tele\u00ad\nphone line between Paris and London, even though '(as far as \nwe know) only the French authorities are likely to have tapped \nit'. The real problem was which Frenchmen knew about the \nback-channel arrangement. It turned out that even the President \nhad not been told, so the French diplomats were 'apprehensive \nof the resentment as much of General de Gaulle as of Chairman \nMao'.40 \nThe Americans had suffered a similar code-room raid in \nTaiwan ten years before. There had been a riot outside their \nEmbassy in Taipei, which had been penetrated. Cryptographic \nmaterial had been taken after 'the walls of the code room were \nbroken through with sledgehammers'. Some one hundred rotors \nfor cypher machines were also taken, although many were later \nrecovered from the Embassy grounds after the intruders fled. \nNoone had believed that the Embassy code room would be \npenetrated until it was too late to destroy the cryptographic \nequipment. While the cypher team claimed that they had locked \nthe safe containing the crucial rotors, the evidence indicated \nthat in fact they had not done so, since the safe was open but \nshowed no sign of damage.41 \nAll new bUildings, whether embassies abroad or intelligence \nheadquarters at home, were now a massive communications \nsecurity headache for both the British and the Americans.42 \nWhen SIS moved from Broadway Buildings near St James's \nPark to its new tower-block site at Century House in Westminster \nRoad in 1966, about a quarter of the refurbishment costs were \nfor communications security work, including soundproofing and \ndouble windowsY Even worse was the problem of new embassy \nbuildings in Communist countries. The gradual thawing of the \nCold War in the 1960s, followed by a process of 'detente', led \nto the British recognition of East Germany. All of a sudden there \nwas a need to develop a new British Embassy in East Berlin. \n196 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nFrom the outset it was assumed that this building would be a \nmajor target for the East German Intelligence Service, which \nwas known to use the most sophisticated technical devices.44 \nJames Reeve, the Ambassador Designate, was given the task \nof locating a suitable building for the new embassy, his choice \ngoverned largely by communications security anxieties. \nAccommodation was in short supply in East Berlin, and to his \ndismay the only premises that would fit the bill were an apart\u00ad\nment block fronted by a rather garish shop selling ladies' lingerie. \nReeve feared that the placing of one of Her Majesty's Embassies \nover such an establishment 'would doubtless attract amused \ncomment if not criticism'. Nevertheless, security ruled all, and \nwork on converting the upper floors of the building into an \nembassy went ahead. Reeve recalls: \n* While this preparatory building work was underway, we \nhad no doubt that various pieces of spying equipment such \nas fibre optics and listening devices were also being installed. \nOur own installation of physical security and alarm systems \nat the Embassy, as well as the construction of an inner\u00ad\ncasing sound-insulated conference room, were undertaken \nby direct British labour with the material brought across \nfrom West Berlin. \n* The shell of the specially insulated conference room required \nseveral tons of cement. Reeve hoped fervently that the admin\u00ad\nistrators of the building had given the correct load-bearing figures \nfor the floors, 'or otherwise the lingerie shop below would be \nin for a surprise' Y \nA team of nine technicians had made their way from Hanslope \nPark to the construction site in East Berlin.46 Months of hard \nwork lay ahead. Dealing with the bugging threat was the major \ntask, and the first stage was for all the old communications \nwiring to be stripped out of the building from the second floor \nUp.47 They then created a temporary room that was impervious \nto radio waves, called a 'Belling Lee', to shield their cypher \nEMBASSY WARS 197 \nequipment, before building a more permanent shielded cypher \nroom. They also installed a 'cocktail noise' -generating system \nto block surveillance devices, and supervised the construction \nof the secure conference facility, which they called the 'speech \nsafe room'.4B After the ransacking of the cypher room in the \nPeking Embassy in 1967, they worried that the building might \nbe quickly overrun by an orchestrated riot, so they provided \ncypher-equipment destruction kits.49 Despite all these elaborate \nprecautions, James Reeve recalls that there were still moments \nduring his tour of service in Berlin that reminded him of what \nhe delicately called 'the need for circumspection in office conver\u00ad\nsation'. One day he was about to head out to a meeting at the \nEast German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the very last moment \nhe decided to take an expanded delegation of five colleagues, \nrather than the previously announced team of three. When \nthey arrived, a tray with five coffee cups was already waiting \nfor them.so \nEmbassy wars - a feverish battle with bugs and telephone taps \n-were a dominant theme that connected the 1950s and the \n1960s. Over a period of twenty years, diplomatic missions ceased \nto be elegant salons peacefully advancing their nations' inter\u00ad\nests and were gradually transformed into technical fortresses \nfrom which espionage was both launched and repelled. \nIronically, as the Cold War moved from a period of intense \nhostility, symbolised by figures such as Stalin, towards the possi\u00ad\nbility of detente under a new generation of leaders such as \nKhrushchev, the increased diplomatic interaction between East \nand West only offered yet more possibilities for electronic espi\u00ad\nonage. \nOther important changes were now visible. In the 1950s, \nGCHQ's Director Eric Jones had enjoyed tremendous success in \nthe new field of elint, often as the result of daring operations \nthat pushed submarines and aircraft to their very limit. In the \n1 960s his successor, Clive Loehnis, faced new challenges. Aircraft \nand submarines were still important, but looked increasingly \n198 FIGHTING THE ELECTRONIC WAR \nvulnerable. Meanwhile, computers and satellites were coming \nto the fore as the new wonder weapons of high-tech espionage. \nGC:HQ's partners in America were running a billion-dollar busi\u00ad\nness, and the code-breakers of Cheltenham were anxiously \nwondering how they would manage to keep up. \nTHE 19605 \nSPACE, SPY SHIPS \nAND SCANDALS \n11 \nHarold Macmillan -Shootdowns, \nCyp hers and Spending \nIt seems to me these things may become very dangerous. \nPrime Minister Harold Macmillan to Foreign Secretary \nAlec DouglaS-Home, 1 August 19601 \nAt 8 o'clock on the morning of 1 May 1960, Captain Igor \nMentyukov was standing quietly at a bus stop in the small \ntown of Perm, two hundred miles north of Sverdlovsk in \ncentral Russia. Mentyukov was a top fighter pilot -but there \nwas no flying scheduled today, since this was May Day, a \nmajor holiday for all the Soviet people. Quite unexpectedly, \none of the ground crew from the nearby airbase rushed up \nand told him to report for immediate action. An American \nU-2 spy plane was even now heading in their direction, and \nthe orders from Soviet Air Defence Command were to shoot \nit down. Minutes later, arriving breathless alongside a Sukhoi \nSU-9 fighter, the latest model to enter service, Mentyukov \nwas dismayed to discover that it was unarmed. His commander \nexplained apologetically that there had not been time to load \nany ammunition or missiles. Moscow was now insisting that \nhe take off immediately in civilian clothes and ram the \nintruder. 'Take care of my wife and mother,' he muttered \nglumly in the last moments before take-ofU \nHis target was a CIA U-2 spy plane, piloted by Gary Powers. \nThe U-2 was effectively a rocket-powered glider that was capable \nof cruising at over seventy thousand feet, making it immune to \nair defences, and was used to collect both photography and \nsigint over Russia. The U-2 had entered service in 1956, and its \n202 SPACE, Spy SHIPS AND SCANDALS \npilots had flown more than twenty successful missions; however, \nSoviet technology was catching up. Mentyukov's new SU-9 \nfighter engaged afterburners from the moment of take-off, \nturning it into a veritable rocket. When he finished his momen\u00ad\ntous climb he was very close to Powers, but his high speed \ncaused him to overshoot. Somewhat relieved to find that he \nwas already perilously low on fuel, he was excused the more \ndemanding part of his mission and was ordered back to base.3 \nAbout ten minutes later, Powers came within range of a Soviet \nsurface-to-air missile battery. Three missiles were launched. One \nmissed its targe~, the second destroyed a hapless Soviet MiG-\n19 that was speeding towards the intruder, but the third exploded \njust under the U-2, badly damaging its tail and sending it into \na spin. Powers made an inelegant exit from the doomed aircraft, \nfailed to press the self-destruct mechanism that would have \ndestroyed its cameras, and was saved by his parachute, which \ndeployed automatically. Later that day the Soviet leader, Nikita \nKhrushchev, was delighted to discover that not only was the \nU-2 largely intact, but its pilot had been captured alive. President \nEisenhower was unaware of this, and blundered by offering the \npublic a preposterous cover story about a weather research \nmission -which was soon revealed to be a sham.4 \nThe U-2 overflight programme, which had included six British \nRAP pilots, was intimately connected to sigint. Not only did \nthe aircraft collect sigint as well as imagery, but most of the \ntargets they were probing had been initially found by sigint. \nMoreover, Soviet efforts to shoot them down revealed a wealth \nof detail about Russian air defences, which were closely moni\u00ad\ntored. Sigint showed that Moscow's command and control \nsystem was poor, radar coverage was patchy and fighter reac\u00ad\ntion times were slow. With each U-2 flight dozens of fighters \nscrambled to try to shoot the aircraft down, often revealing \nhitherto unknown units and fighter bases. All this had encour\u00ad\naged confidence about the invulnerability of the high-flying U-\n2. Indeed, NSA staff who listened in to Soviet radars and fighter \ncontrollers during the Gary Powers flight argued that he had \nCommander \nAlastair Denniston , \nthe first head of \nGC&CS. \nCommander Edward \nTravis, GCHQ's first \npost-war director. \nVoice interception during the Second \nWorld War, which saw intelligenc e \noperations on an industrial scale. \nArlington Hall, \nwhere Venona \nwas broken. \nThe majority of \nthose working \non sigint were \nwomen. \nOne of the key UKUSA meetings in the early 1950s.

The \nincident encapsulated many of the wider international trends \nof the 1960s. During the decade there were major flashpoints \nsuch as the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962 and the Soviet inva\u00ad\nsion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. There were also serious \nconfrontations in the Third World, the largest being the Vietnam \nWar, which kept the temperature at boiling point. Although \nengaged in an arms race, East and West had achieved nuclear \nparity, signalled by the deployment of Soviet missiles which \ncould reach the American homeland. In theory at least, all-out \nconfrontation now seemed to be a remote possibility because \nof nuclear deterrence. Intelligence had an important part to \nplay in the unfolding drama. On the face of it, constant intel\u00ad\nligence monitoring, including sigint and imagery, exercised a \nstabilising influence on world affairs, reassuring both sides that \nno sneak attack was imminent and making arms control more \nfeasible. However, the operations that gathered the intelligence, \nsuch as the Gary Powers flight, involved an element of risk \nand provocation. For both the British and the Americans, risk \ncalculation became an increasingly important part of managing \nintelligence operations. In turn, this sense of risk helped to \ndrive one of the most important developments of the decade, \nthe first tentative efforts at the collection of intelligence from \nthe safety of satellites in space. \nTwo months after the U-2 shootdown, with the controversy \nstill raging, an American RB -47H ferret aircraft was shot down \nby Soviet MiGs over the naval airbases of the Kola Peninsula, \n204 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nclose to where British submarines regularly conducted surveil\u00ad\nlance. Only two of the five crewmen survived. This was the \nfirst close reconnaissance mission the West had risked after the \nloss of the U-2. Although less publicised than the Gary Powers \nepisode, this calamity reverberated more strongly for Britain, \nsince the plane had been launched from RAF Brize Norton in \nOxfordshire. American and Norwegian sigint stations had tracked \nit, but disputed its course, plotting it thirty miles and twenty\u00ad\nthree miles respectively from the Soviet coast. The crew had \nreceived orders not to go closer than fifty miles. The Soviet \ncoastal limit was twelve miles, but at aircraft speeds the margin \nfor error was small. 7 The two crew members who survived, \nhaving been rescued by a Russian trawler, confirmed to their \nSoviet captors that they had left Brize Norton at 10 a.m. on 1 \nJuly, but told them little else.8 \nPrime Minister Harold Macmillan was exceedingly bitter about \nthe Powers shootdown, because it contributed to the collapse \nof the impending East-West summit in Paris. Macmillan had \nworked hard to encourage this meeting, and reportedly \nexclaimed that 'the Pentagon is blowing up the Summit \nConference'.9 Macmillan noted in his diary that the Americans \nhad committed 'a great folly'. He expressed personal disap\u00ad\npointment with Gary Powers, who 'did not poison himself (as \nordered) but has been taken prisoner (with his poison needle \nin his pocket!)'. He lamented that the Soviets had captured the \naircraft, the cameras, the photographs and the pilot, a~ding: \n'God knows what he will say when he is tortured!'10 \nRussia exploited the incident to the full, threatening coun\u00ad\ntries such as Britain and Japan, which hosted the reconnais\u00ad\nsance flights. On 30 May the Soviet Minister of Defence, Rodion \nMalinovsky, warned that 'crushing blows by rocket forces will \nbe dealt to the bases from which they take off'. On 3 June these \nthreats were repeated by Nikita Khrushchev himself to a packed \npress conference. In London, the Joint Intelligence Committee \nconcluded that these threats were a bluff. Nevertheless they \ninduced extreme caution on the part of Harold Macmillan.11 \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 205 \nTwo weeks later, Patrick Reilly, the British Ambassador in \nMoscow, tried to smooth matters by telling the Soviet Foreign \nMinister, Andrei Gromyko, how distressed London was at the \nnegative impact on East-West relations. Gromyko, who was in \nan 'ugly mood', replied in 'unusually discourteous language', \ndeclaring that Russia 'knew the true facts' about the secret \nmissions.12 \nLondon, Washington and Moscow engaged in a ritual argu\u00ad\nment about the exact position of the RB-47 when it was shot \ndown over the sea. The Americans stated that it never came \ncloser than forty-eight miles to Soviet airspace. Moscow claimed \nthat the plane was 'specially equipped for espionage operations', \nand was definitely shot down over Soviet territorial waters. The \nproblem for the Americans was that only a month previously, \ntheir cover story about the Gary Powers U-2 being a weather \nresearch aircraft had quickly been exposed as a tissue of lies, \nprompting a humiliating climbdown by President Eisenhower. \nGary Powers himself was subjected to a show trial in front of the \nworld's media, and the Soviets promised that the two surviving \nmembers of the RB-47 crew would soon be 'brought before the \ncourt and tried with the full rigour of the Soviet law' Y \nHarold Macmillan was clearly rattled. On 12 July he told \nEisenhower that the whole question of using UK bases for recon\u00ad\nnaissance flights would have to be looked at, and suggested that \n'Your and our intelligence authorities should conduct a joint \nreview about the system and conditions under which these \nflights are conducted: Macmillan felt that this was particularly \nimportant, as the Soviets had announced that they were going \nto adopt 'a policy of shooting down any aircraft, wherever it \nmay be, on the grounds that it is conducting reconnaissance or \nis in an area from which they prefer to exclude foreign aircraft'. \nMacmillan wanted this review to take place as soon as possible. \nAlthough he told Eisenhower that the RB-47 incident had \nincreased the 'sense of solidarity between us', in reality it had \nalso heightened the sense of risk regarding the whole business \nof sigint surveillance from any platform. 14 \n206 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nAndrei Gromyko took the opportunity to highlight the issue \nof the intense surveillance of Soviet vessels in international \nwaters. He complained to Western diplomats, including Patrick \nReilly, about the 'provocative buzzing of Soviet ships' by \nAmerican aircraft on the high seas, and asserted that this was \nhappening on all the oceans of the world, with even civilian \nresearch ships being subjected to the practice. 'The buzzing of \nSoviet ships by American planes is done, as a rule, at mast-top \naltitude in the dangerous proximity of Soviet ships, often \ninvolving dives down on the ships, simulated bomb and torpedo \nrelease movements, the dropping of various moving objects \nand incendiary devices ... as well as other impermissible \nactions.' Gromyko claimed that there had been 250 such inci\u00ad\ndents in the first five months of 1960.15 The truth of these \nassertions remains unknown, but there were clearly some \ncowboy incidents, and even NSA's own official historian of the \nCold War has admitted that, broadly speaking, reconnaissance \n'exacerbated an already touchy situation' .16 \nIn Britain, clearance procedures for sigint flights were already \nstringent, having been tightened up after the Buster Crabb \nincident in 1956. David Ormsby Gore, the Minister of State \nfor Foreign Affairs, asked his officials, 'Surely the RAF under\u00ad\ntake no flights which entail some risk of incident unless the \noperation has been cleared by a Foreign Office Minister of \nState or by the Permanent Under-Secretary?' Peter Wilkinson, \nhead of the Permanent Under-Secretary's Department, \nconfirmed that this was correct. What happened, he explained, \nwas that the RAF submitted a programme of 'special flights' \nfor the Prime Minister's approval six months in advance. Closer \nto the time, each day flight had to receive additional clear\u00ad\nance from the Foreign Secretary, while night flights, which \nwere thought less risky, were cleared by the Permanent Under\u00ad\nSecretary. This procedure included American reconnaissance \nmissions from British basesY \nHarold Macmillan absolutely hated the public fuss caused by \nspy scandals and espionage incidents. Accordingly, he took a \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 207 \ndeep personal interest in these matters. IS On 1 August 1960 he \nasked his Foreign Secretary to conduct an inquiry into' \"buzzing\" \nin all its forms'. He was not referring to operations like the \nU-2 mission, which he considered to be clearly illegal. Instead \nhe meant 'things which are within the law but no doubt disagree\u00ad\nable to the victims ... It seems to me these things may become \nvery dangerous.'19 Unusually, Macmillan insisted on a series of \nspecial meetings for key Cabinet Ministers with the Chairman \nof the JIC, Sir Hugh Stephenson, in attendance. The rules for \nBritish sigint flights were firmed up, but the problem was what \nto do about the Americans. Against his instincts, Macmillan \nadmitted that there was no benefit in raising the matter in the \ndying days of the Eisenhower administration.20 \nIn Britain, the twin shootdowns of 1960 had a similar impact \nto the Buster Crabb affair four years before. This time they \nserved to crush a plan for increased airborne surveillance of the \nSoviet fleet that had been agreed between the First Sea Lord \nand the US Navy's Chief of Naval Operations.21 By March 1961 \nthese plans had been postponed, and they were later 'put into \ncold storage indefinitely'.22 Other long-established British \nprogrammes were also brought to a close. Like Eden before him, \nMacmillan now required the JIC to prepare a review of all aerial \nand submarine surveillance tasks, covering both imagery and \nsigint, so he could assess the value of the intelligence gained \nfrom these activities and measure it against the risks.23 Defence \nintelligence chiefs were miserable, since the flow of short-range \nintercepts from these missions had been one of the few precious \nareas of sigint success. Air Vice Marshal Bufton, head of Air \nIntelligence, noted: 'The bulk of the intelligence on Soviet scien\u00ad\ntific research and development on missiles comes from G.C.H.Q. \nintercepts,' and 'it is \"hot\" intelligence'. 24 \nThese developments contained an element of irony. In the \nearly 1950s, Britain and the United States had placed growing \nemphasis on 'technical means' of espionage, such as sigint-gath\u00ad\nering aircraft and overhead photography, because the use of \n208 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nhuman agents inside Russia had proved increasingly hazardous \nand, with a few exceptions, rather unproductive. But now, \nforward surveillance with aircraft and submarines was also \nproving risky. Safer alternatives certainly existed. As early as \n1956 the British had begun cultivating an alternative form of \nsea-borne surveillance: gathering intelligence on the Soviet fleet \nfrom the relative safety of British trawlers operating in northern \nwaters. This was a direct copy of the Soviet sigint trawlers that \nbecame a ubiquitous plague by the 1960s. However, the real \nfuture of risk-free intelligence-gathering lay with satellites. The \nAmericans were already experimenting with the collection of \nboth sigint and overhead photography from space.2S \nOn 22 June 1960, less than two months after the shoot\u00ad\ndown of the Gary Powers U-2, the United States launched its \nfirst sigint satellite. For many years it was believed that the \nfirst operational intelligence-gathering space project was a \nsatellite called 'Corona', which collected imagery. In fact the \nfirst intelligence satellite was 'Grab', which stood for 'Galactic \nRadiation and Background'. It was so secret that no details \nwere released until the late 1990s. Publicly announced as a \nUS Navy satellite designed to monitor the effects of solar radi\u00ad\nation on radio communications, in reality it had a more secret \nsecond mission, namely gathering elint from Russia. Naval \nengineers simply took the electronic intelligence antennae that \nwere being used on submarines penetrating Soviet harbours \nand bolted them onto the outside of the satellite. In the highest \ntraditions of space engineering, the first designs were drawn \non the back of a paper place mat when scientists were stranded \nin a Howard Johnson's restaurant during a snowstorm. \nAlthough crude, the Grab satellite was highly effective, and \nsoon torrents of elint from its listening missions high over the \nSoviet Union were pouring down from space. In the 1960s \nsuch satellites remained small, since it was more than a decade \nbefore their potential for listening in to communications as \nwell as elint from radars became apparent. However, this was \nclearly the long-term future of sigint collection, and eventu-\nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 209 \nally they would be followed into space by intelligence-gath\u00ad\nering giants. 26 \nThe British and Americans were also enjoying new scientific \nbreakthroughs in the highly secret world of cypher machines. \nThe target of these operations was not the Soviet Union, but \nrather their West European friends and allies. These countries, \nwhether allied like West Germany or neutral like Sweden, had \na curious dual status as both lowly intelligence collaborators \nand also sigint targets. The management of relations with such \nallies and neutrals in Europe, some of which eventually became \n'third party' members of the UKUSA alliance, was often contro\u00ad\nversial. As we have seen, immediately after the Second World \nWar, more than half the traffic being analysed by American \ncode-breakers was French.27 During the late 1950s and early \n1960s, one of the big issues for the British and the Americans \nhad been supplying cypher machines to fellow NATO coun\u00ad\ntries. Most of those that had been supplied to European coun\u00ad\ntries after the war were now regarded as insecure.28 This was \nbecause in the 1950s it had been discovered that many cypher \nmachines that produced secure codes nevertheless radiated \nout a clear signal of the message they were sending over a \ndistance of about a hundred yards - a problem known as \n'Tempest'.29 To deal with this, a new American cypher machine \ncalled the KL-7 was rushed into service within NATO, and \nwas also given to other partners, including Rhodesia and South \nAfrica.30 \nCypher machines are extremely expensive, and the United \nStates bore much of the cost of re-equipping Western Europe's \ncommunicators. This was partly to improve security in order to \nthwart Soviet code-breakers. However, the more secret explan\u00ad\nation, which no one wished to admit to, was that NSA and \nGCHQ wanted to suppress the efforts of European countries to \nmake their own cypher machines.31 The British and Americans \ndid not want the Continental Europeans to develop their own \ncommercial cypher-machine industry, exporting machines \n210 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \naround the world which would then generate messages that \nwould prove difficult for GCHQ or NSA to break. In short, \nsupplying American machines like the KL-7 virtually for free \nwas intended to undercut the market and drive European manu\u00ad\nfacturers out of business. \nCypher machines remained a hot NATO issue throughout the \n1960s. Partly because of their massive resources, the Americans \nwere in the driving seat, and were advancing radical ideas. NSA \nargued that NATO countries in Europe should be allowed to manu\u00ad\nfacture British-and American-designed machines under a scheme \ncalled 'free licensing'. This meant making these designs available \nwithout cost, and ensured that NATO communications would \nenjoy the greatest degree of commonality and inter-operability. \nMore importantly, the Americans also wished to continue to \ndiscourage smaller NATO countries from developing their own \ncypher-machine industries. Although GCHQ liked the idea, other \nparts of British government did not. Many in Whitehall felt they \nhad no power to compel British manufacturers of cypher equip\u00ad\nment to grant free licences to the Europeans, and would have to \npay them expensive compensation. Moreover, London had almost \ncompleted negotiations for the Canadians to manufacture the \nimpressive new British Alvis on-line cypher system under licence, \nand feared that this deal would be undermined.32 \nIn June 1962 there was a serious clash between Clive Loehnis, \nthe new Director of GCHQ, and the Ministry of Defence.33 GCHQ \nsupported the American proposal, explaining that 'SIGINT wanted \nto avoid the spreading of cryptographic techniques and knowl\u00ad\nedge,' and that NSA's proposal would remove 'the financial incen\u00ad\ntive from the development of cryptographic equipment in NATO'. \nLoehnis's colleague Fred Stannard, who looked after the commu\u00ad\nnications security organisation known as LCSA, heartily agreed.34 \nHowever, commercial interests won the day. To the utter dismay \nof GCHQ and LCSA, Whitehall offered a stem rejection of the \nAmerican 'free-licensing' idea. Stannard had the unpleasant duty \nof telling the Americans that their ideas had been vetoed.35 He \nlater reported that the news had 'shocked' NSA, and GCHQ's \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 211 \nliaison officers in America feared that 'our attitude will in fact \nimpair the relations between NSA and GCHQ and LCSA'.36 \nLoehnis and Stannard did not give up, and now argued that \nBritain's refusal to cooperate might lead to NSA hardening its \napproach to Britain, especially in the area of the Mutual Weapons \nDevelopment Program, a secret route by which the Americans \nsubsidised equipment for both GCHQ and LCSA. NSA also saved \nBritain costs by assisting with the testing of the security of its \nnew cypher equipment. Loehnis argued that agreeing with NSA \non this matter would not only 'prevent damage to our most \nimportant and unique SIGINT and COMSEC relations with the \nUnited States', but would also save money in the long run.37 It \nwas certainly true that over the previous decade large amounts \nof expensive equipment used by GCHQ's sigint programme had \nbeen supplied through this scheme, mostly for elint and elec\u00ad\ntronic warfare. 38 \nThe matter culminated in a remarkable showdown at the \nTreasury on 10 July 1962. Loehnis and Stannard set out what \nthey insisted was the irreplaceable value of close sigint cooper\u00ad\nation between GCHQ and NSA, emphasising that the 'principal \nfeature of the partnership was the full interchange of the \n\"product\" '.39 LCSA's relationship with the communications secu\u00ad\nrity division of NSA was, they declared, no less close. With \nperhaps a little hyperbole, they argued that Britain might \n'endanger this partnership' by appearing to act unsympatheti\u00ad\ncally. They warned that: \n* N.S.A. would see United Kingdom reluctance to meet them \non free licensing as positively damaging, because they \nregarded their own proposal as the only way of removing \nfrom other N.A.T.O. countries the incentive to do their own \nresearch and development in COMSEC. And the continu\u00ad\nation of this research and development would, N.S.A. \nconsidered, damage the United Kingdom/U.S.A. SIGINT \ninterests. \n* \n212 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nFundamentals were at stake. Meanwhile, they asserted, the cost \nof supporting the NSA plan was a relatively small amount of \ncompensation to British companies such as Plessey for the free \nlicensing of its new Alvis machine.40 In the event GCHQ won \nthe day, and equipment was supplied to NATO nations at a \nhighly subsidised COSt.41 \nAs an additional backstop, GCHQ and NSA quietly encour\u00ad\naged their NATO allies to introduce legislation that regulated the \nexport of cypher machines in the same way that arms exports \nwere tightly controlled. However, there was an alarming loop\u00ad\nhole. The restrictions did not apply to neutral countries such as \nSweden or Switzerland. Switzerland was one of the world's most \nadvanced manufacturers of a range of technical defence equip\u00ad\nment, from optical instruments to radar. It had a long\u00ad\nestablished record as a manufacturer of excellent cypher \nmachines, the reputation of which was enhanced by public confi\u00ad\ndence in Swiss neutrality. This 'neutrals problem' was being ener\u00ad\ngetically addressed by GCHQ and NSA. The main issue was a \nwell-known Swiss company called Crypto AG, which was owned \nby a Swede, Boris Hagelin Senior, one of the world's top experts \non cypher machines and a significant innovator in the field of \ncryptography. Crypto AG had become an increasingly important \nsupplier of cypher equipment after the Second World War, trading \non the Swiss reputation for excellent technology and neutrality. \nHow NSA and GCHQ 'neutralised the neutrals' is an extraor\u00ad\ndinary tale. The story seems to have begun on 4 September \n1956, when the Australian Embassy in Washington 'had a ring \nfrom a character who wanted to sell us some cipher \nmachines'Y The 'character' was none other than Boris Hagelin \nJunior, who represented two of his father's companies -Crypto \nAG in Switzerland and AB Cryptoteknik in Sweden -and ran \na sales office in Maryland. He boasted that, together, the two \ncompanies had manufactured over 150,000 cypher machines \nwhich were in service with over thirty countriesY \nHagelin Junior was busy moving around Washington selling \ncypher machines to the many foreign embassies there. He \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 213 \npersisted with his pitch to the Australians, supplying copies of \nCrypto AG technical literature which the Embassy sent back to \nCanberra. There it was passed to Vic Rolf at Defence Signals \nBranch, Australia's sigint agency. In turn, he forwarded it to \nFred Stannard and LCSA in London.44 LCSA was very inter\u00ad\nested, since the literature revealed that Crypto AG was producing \nsome new and alarmingly advanced machines. LCSA was soon \nrelaying more and more detailed questions about the new \nmachines through its Australian proxy, which now posed plau\u00ad\nsibly as a buyer. Australian officials in Canberra noted: 'At no \nstage did we inform our Embassy of the use to which the papers \nwere put.' Later, the Australian code-breakers purchased some \nsamples but did 'not wish to become known to any overseas \ncontact as the ultimate addressee' Y Meanwhile, Hagelin \nremained exceedingly keen to sell its cypher machines and \n'random generators' used for making one-time pads.46 \nIn August 1957 William Friedman, one of NSA's most experi\u00ad\nenced code-breakers and a long-standing friend of John Tiltman, \nwas sent on a special mission to Britain. Some have suggested \nthat this was because GCHQ had become suspicious that the \nAmericans had been reading British messages prior to the Suez \ninvasion -something forbidden by the UKUSA agreement -and \nFriedman was being sent to offer reassurance. But that was not \nthe main purpose of the visit. On 26 August Friedman arrived \nat GCHQ to be greeted by old friends such as Josh Cooper. For \na week he shuttled between GCHQ's new site at Cheltenham \nand the offices of LCSA in Palmer Street. The main focus of \ndiscussion was collaboration against the West Europeans, and \na key issue was the increasingly advanced machines being \nproduced by Crypto AG and AB Cryptoteknik. NSA later \nadmitted that the purpose of Friedman's visit was ensuring that \nit continued to have 'the daily information enabling NSA to \nread NATO countries' messages'. Friedman's biographer \nrecounts: 'Ciphering machines incorporating ingenious variants \nand improvements were being produced in Europe by more \nthan one manufacturer and were being bought and adapted by \n214 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nmore than one NATO country.' Unsurprisingly, Friedman's sub\u00ad\nsequent destinations 0!1 his European grand tour were Sweden \nand SwitzerlandY \nHaving consulted closely with GCHQ and LCSA, it appears \nthat Friedman came to a private arrangement with a number \nof companies in 'neutral' Sweden and Switzerland. The exact \nnature of the negotiations between him and Hagelin remains \nobscure, but this was a historic meeting, since they were two \nof the twentieth century's most experienced cypher experts. \nCertainly by 1975 it appears that NSA was actively involved in \nsubverting the next range of Crypto AG machines. Reportedly, \nNSA's approach was to introduce a flaw so that the machines \nsecretly broadcast the cypher key, undermining their own \nencryption. The alleged result was that NSA could read the \nencoded messages even faster than the intended recipient. This \napproach is known as a 'trap door', and has also been used \nmore recently in computer encryptions.48 \nThe secret of NSA's programme to penetrate much of the \ntraffic carried by 'neutral' cypher machines did not begin to leak \nout until the 1980s.49 Publicly, NSA and GCHQ have never \nadmitted the alleged operation against Crypto AG, but by the \nsummer of 1986 many of the details of this sensitive secret had \nreached the ears of Congressional committees on Capitol Hill, \nand it seemed only a matter of time before they appeared on \nthe pages of the New York Times and the Washington Post. General \nBill adorn, then the Director of NSA, was furious, and held a \npersonal meeting with Robert Gates, Deputy Director of the \nCIA, on 6 November 1986. There was only one question on the \nagenda: 'Who told Cong[ress] about Cry AG?'50 NSA was also \nworking with the West Germans on this project. In his daily \nlog, adorn referred to a periodic review of the 'Swiss connec\u00ad\ntion' in his meetings with George Wieck, the head of the \nBundesnachrichtendienst (BND), the West German intelligence \nservice that handled both sigint and human agents.51 \nCooperation between NSA and the BND was central to the \nsubversion of the neutral machines. 52 \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 215 \nThe German newspaper Der Spiegel has alleged that later, a \nsecret meeting of th~ BND had discussed how to change the \nownership of Crypto AG, perhaps through a merger. Reportedly, \nthe BND also considered how the Swedish communications \ncompany Ericsson might be persuaded, through the medium of \nits German counterpart Siemens, to terminate its expanding \ncryptographic business. One former employee of Crypto AG \nstated that he had to coordinate his developments with shadowy \nfigures 'from Bad Godesberg' -the location of the Central Office \nfor Encryption Affairs of the BND. Employees also recalled the \narrival of NSA officials who advised on the use of certain encryp\u00ad\ntion methods.53 All this is perhaps not as surprising as it appears, \nsince Switzerland and Sweden had been secret de facto allies \nof NATO since the early Cold War. 54 A recently declassified \nBritish document shows that NATO had already come to an \nunofficial understanding with Switzerland: in peace it would be \nneutral, but in wartime it would support NATO.55 \nLooming over all these cypher-machine issues like a vast black \ncloud was the trouhlesome issue called 'Tempest', the term used \nfor the tendency of all electronic devices to radiate an electro\u00ad\nmagnetic field over a short range, usually less than a hundred \nyards.56 There has been much debate about when this phenom\u00ad\nenon of radiation or 'emanation' was first identified. The NSA \nofficial history states that Germans had discovered it during the \nSecond World War, but that its real importance was only recog\u00ad\nnised by a CIA technician in 1951.57 Whoever discovered it, \nduring the early 1950s it had become clear that this radiation \ncould allow an enemy to listen in to cypher machines at short \nrange in a way no one had previously envisaged. The British \ndo not seem to have been aware of Tempest until 1952, when \nit was accidentally discovered that a cypher machine in the \nWashington Embassy was radiating out the plain text of the \nmessages it was processing. Tempest was a huge problem, \nbecause many expensive cypher machines were suddenly found \nto be vulnerable.58 \n216 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nNevertheless, Tempest also allowed the British to attack the \ncypher machines of their enemies. In his memoirs the former \nMI5 officer Peter Wright claims to have been one of the first \nusers of Tempest to eavesdrop on cypher machines in the French \nand Egyptian Embassies in London. There is no doubt that such \noperations took place. During the late 1950s and early 1960s \nWright joined John Hawkes from SIS in planning these sophis\u00ad\nticated activities.59 Ralph Benjamin, GCHQ's Chief Scientist, \nremembers Wright as a superb self-taught technician.60 Wright \nrecounts an operation in 1956 in which British intelligence \nsuccessfully attClcked the Hagelin cypher machines in the \nEgyptian Embassy in London by picking up emanations from \nthe keyboard using a microphone in an operation code-named \n'Engulf'.61 In the late 1950s, in what appears to have been a \ncoordinated effort with the Americans, British intelligence \ncollected signals generated by French diplomatic cypher \nmachines in London and Washington. These efforts ended in \nlate 1964, when the French finally installed protective copper \nshielding in their cypher rooms to prevent radiation.62 \nWhat none of these accounts captures is the exquisite dilemma \nof offence versus defence. With Tempest, the conflicting demands \nof offensive sigint and defensive communications security were \nso complex as to make the head spin. The optimum solution \nwas for GCHQ and NSA to be able to read the traffic of minor \nallies and neutral countries themselves, but to provide them \nwith enough defensive expertise to make their communications \nimmune to similar code-breaking efforts by the sigint special\u00ad\nists of the KGB. Tempest allowed GCHQ and NSA to launch \ninnovative attacks on all sorts of machines that had not yet \nbeen broken, but this was only an unalloyed virtue if the Soviets \nwere lagging behind in its use. This, in turn, raised another \nawkward question: how much did the Soviets know? \nIn April 1958 Fred Stannard visited Ottawa to brief the \nCanadian Cipher Policy Committee on the latest developments. \nHis message was that Tempest was a terrible and complex secur\u00ad\nity problem. While some cypher machines radiated out an elec-\nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 217 \ntromagnetic field, others gave out an acoustic echo that could \ntravel down a wire for hundreds of feet. Still others caused tell\u00ad\ntale fluctuations in the power supply. Even those machines that \ndid not radiate of their own accord were susceptible to 'inter\u00ad\nrogation attack'. This meant that the KGB could potentially \ndirect a microwave or laser beam at the cypher room, reflecting \nback reverberations that might give away the clear text of a \nmessage as it was typed on the keyboard. The only saving grace \nwas that the danger was confined to a few hundred yards at \nmost, so the enemy had to get close to the cypher machine they \nwanted to listen to.63 \nStannard explained that the most awkward issue presented \nby Tempest was 'how we may best distribute our responsibili\u00ad\nties for advising our allies, particularly in NATO'. Tempest was \na nuisance in terms of security, but of course it was beneficial \nfor offensive sigint operations by GCHQ. The British did not \nwant information about Tempest to spread to 'countries or organ\u00ad\nisations from which signal intelligence is required'. Where the \nbalance of advantage fell depended on the relative importance \nattached to either sigint or security. Understandably, perhaps, \nthere were some arguments between GCHQ and LCSA over this \nmatter.64 \nBy the early 1960s the awkward NATO Tempest question was \ngradually being resolved. A handbook was provided to the \nEuropean allies that explained how to install cypher equipment \nso as to minimise radiation risks from Tempest.65 However, LCSA \nemphasised that, within the inner circle constituted by the \nBritish, Americans and Canadians, the standard NATO briefing \nhad always to be accompanied by 'advice on certain aspects of \nthe problem which it is undesirable to disseminate to NATO at \nlarge'. This circumlocutory language suggests that Britain was \noffering some of its NATO partners incomplete advice, leaving \nopen certain avenues for exploitation. At the same time, GCHQ \nhoped fervently that the KGB was not using the same tech\u00ad\nniques.66 \nAt last, after two troublesome decades, Britain's code-breakers \n218 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nand code-makers were finally getting to grips with Tempest. The \nissue, together with i_ndependent cryptography by European \nNATO allies and neutrals, had presented sensitive and costly \nproblems. However, there had also been enormous achieve\u00ad\nments, many of which are still shrouded in deep secrecy, which \nprovided continuous access to many streams of diplomatic traffic \naround the world. The main beneficiaries were K Division at \nGCHQ, whose task it was to read non-Soviet systems. However, \nthese triumphs also owed much to the work of the unsung \nheroes of communications security, hiding out in one of Britain's \nleast-known secret service headquarters in Palmer Street in \ncentral London. In 1969, their last year of independent opera\u00ad\ntion before they were merged with GCHQ, Fred Stannard's \ncolleagues declared that their secretive influence over cypher \nmachines was the surest route to good intelligence: 'There is \nno better way to successful Sigint than to influence selected \ntarget countries by Comsec advice to use a source of equipment \ndesired by Sigint.' This, they added with quiet satisfaction, 'can \nsometimes be done'.67 \nAlthough the problems of Tempest were now being addressed, \nthey were frighteningly expensive to resolve, and in the 1960s \nmoney was a major problem for all of Britain's secret services. \nIndeed, if a single adjective had to be chosen to describe British \nintelligence during the Cold War, it might well be 'impecunious'. \nThe real world of British secret service at this time was a shabby \none, and the persona of the average intelligence officer was less \nthat of Ian Fleming's glamorous James Bond than of Len Deighton's \ndown-at-heel Harry Palmer. In Cheltenham, Berlin, Cyprus or \nHong Kong, thousands of intelligence operatives endured dingy \noffices notable only for their peeling paint and rotting linoleum. \nMoreover, there was remorseless pressure to economise. \nOne obvious area for economies was the three sprawling \nintelligence empires owned by the Royal Navy, the Army and \nthe RAE As we have seen, each of the armed services had its \nown intelligence activities. Their largest collection task was sigint, \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 219 \nwhich was mostly picked up by dedicated military units of \nlisteners equipped with headphones sitting in Germany, Cyprus \nand Hong Kong and working in close collaboration with GCHQ. \nIn December 1960 an inquiry by General Sir Gerald Templer, \nthe 'Tiger of Malaya', argued that the three intelligence service \ndirectorates should be merged to form a single Defence \nIntelligence Staff, and that most of the secret military listeners \nwho did sigint collection should be replaced by civilians and \nput under the direction of GCHQ. Templer was right, since \nNational Service, which had provided an almost unlimited source \nof personnel for ~hese military sigint units, was coming to an \nend.68 \nGCHQ's money problems were made worse by trying to keep \nup with the Americans. Back in 1955, President Dwight D. \nEisenhower had appointed a major inquiry into intelligence, \nheaded by the leading scientist James R. Killian. Like Templer, \nKillian had concluded that it was now 'exceedingly difficult' to \nrun human agents inside Russia, where the security police were \n'brutally effective'. In future the USA would have to depend \non science and technology for its intelligence. This would mean \nspending huge sums of money on spy satellites and code\u00ad\nbreaking. American intelligence, he noted, was verging on being \na billion-dollar-a-year business. Another intelligence inquiry, \nthe Hoover Commission, came to much the same conclusion. \nIt also proposed an all-out attack on Soviet cyphers using the \nfinest minds and the best computers that money could buy -\nthe equivalent of the Manhattan Project which had produced \nthe first atomic bomb.69 \nBy 1962 the cost of British sigint was rising fast, while overall \ngovernment expenditure was being cut. Something had to give. \nThe i~sue came to a head in a secretive Whitehall committee \ncalled the Permanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence \nServices, or PSIS. Chaired by the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Norman \nBrook, it allowed the most senior denizens of Whitehall to debate \nthe sharing out of the money allocated to the secret services.70 \nIn January 1962, PSIS expressed undisguised horror at the rising \n220 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \ncost of sigint. While careful to praise GCHQ's achievements,_ it \nconcluded that it was time for a comprehensive review of the \norganisation. It was moved in part by the success of Templer's \nrecent inquiry into service intelligence, and hoped fervently for \nmore of the same. Norman Brook called for a wide-ranging \ninvestigation into how GCHQ should develop in the face of \n'increasing technical difficulties' which were pushing up costs, \nand whether the expenditure involved was likely to be 'commen\u00ad\nsurate with the intelligence obtained'. Over the past decade \nGCHQ had enjoyed two generous allocations of additional funds \nto boost its work on Soviet high-grade cyphers. These five-year \nplans for improvement were entitled 'Methods to Improve', or \nMTI. The first was launched in 1952-53 and the second in 1958-\n59. Although much knowledge about the Soviet military had \nbeen gained from special operations with aircraft and \nsubmarines, the golden prize of breaking high-grade cypher \ntraffic and returning to the heady days of 'Ultra' had eluded \nGCHQ.7! The review would also look at the future availability \nof 'overseas sites for interception', since decolonisation was \nconstantly whittling away at GCHQ's precious overseas bases.72 \nGCHQ had been instrumental in the development of some \nof the best British computers in the 1950s, but was now having \nto buy from the American company IBM to obtain state-of-the\u00ad\nart machines. These were expensive, but GCHQ knew that \nwithout constant investment in better computing it was dead \nin the water. In 1963-64 it hoped to double its spending on \nequipment, mostly on new computers, taking its budget from \n\u00a37.5 million to \u00a311 million. Set against a background of recent \nWhitehall economies that had imposed a 10 per cent cut on all \noverseas departments, this was an extravagant request.73 \nMoreover, the cost of GCHQ was only half the picture. Some \nof the costs of British sigint were hidden in the activities of the \narmed services, and were of a similar size and scale. In fact the \ntotal sigint spending was now \u00a320.5 million, and it would soon \novertake the cost of the whole of the Foreign Office, with all \nits embassies and diplomats, of \u00a321.8 million. In other words, \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 221 \nthe servant would soon be paid more than its master. It was \nhardly surprising that a serious review had now been triggered.74 \nIn mid-May 1962 the Chair of the JIC, Hugh Stephenson, \nwent to the Treasury for an informal brainstorming session with \nBurke Trend to decide who should chair the review.75 Trend was \na rising star in the Treasury who had a special fascination with \nthe intelligence services, and presided over their budgets. Their \neventual choice was Sir Stuart Hampshire, an Oxford philo\u00ad\nsophy don. Hampshire seemed an improbable figure to review \nthe future of Britain's most technical intelligence agency. With \na First in Greats, he may have commanded the respect of civil \nservants, but he had no background in maths or science. Having \nbeen elected a Fellow of All Souls in 1936, he joined the Army \nin 1940. His otherworldly nature ensured that his superiors were \nreluctant to let him loose with a compass and a pistol, so he \nwas moved into intelligence. By late 1942 he was in SIS, working \nalongside Hugh Trevor-Roper and the Radio Security Service. \nSome of his time was spent at Bletchley Park, and in July 1944 \nhe found himself deliberating over the July Bomb Plot against \nHitler with several other young SIS officers.76 Like Trend, \nHampshire had a romantic fascination with intelligence, and he \nlater confessed that he had greatly enjoyed 'the spectacle of \nduplicity and deceit in secret intelligence during the war'.77 \nGCHQ prepared for the review by producing a report on the \n'State of Sigint' and material on 'Interception Deployment in \nthe Sixties and Seventies', and forecasting the costs of research \nand development.78 In July it offered a historical summary of \nits post-war activities running to almost forty pages. The first \nversions were regarded as evasive by Whitehall, offering 'no \nassessment of the extent to which their policies had succeeded'. \nAfter much coaxing, later drafts identified precisely what had \nbeen achieved by the two five-year MTI programmes.79 Bill \nMillward, GCHQ's Principal Establishments Officer, offered an \naccount of the core activities against Soviet systems. This was \npainful for several reasons. It not only put an unsuccessful \nprogramme under the spotlight, it also required GCHQ to let \n222 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nthe Treasury have 'specially sensitive information'. Millward \nfound this excruciating, and asked that it be seen only by 'the \nsmallest number of people'. The most interesting part of the \nreport detailed GCHQ's expensive failed attack on the main \nhigh-grade Soviet diplomatic cyphers. The Treasury was asking \nwhether this should ever have been attempted.so \nThe star performer during the review was Joe Hooper, the \nDeputy Director of GCHQ. Hooper knew that cooperation with \nthe Americans was Cheltenham'S trump card, and went to great \nlengths to explain how fortunate Britain was to reap the bene\u00ad\nfits of 'the much more expansive and extravagant effort of the \nAmericans'. He added that senior figures at Cheltenham were \ngenuinely worried about whether they might 'not be making \nan adequate contribution to the UKUSA partnership'. In the \nlate 1940s sigint had often been a story of British cryptanalytical \nskill combined with American computer power, but now 'the \nAmericans are becoming less dependent upon us because they \nare getting better themselves'. The Treasury pressed GCHQ to \nrevisit the UKUSA agreement in order to 'reach a new under\u00ad\nstanding'. It wanted GCHQ to admit frankly that it could no \nlonger afford to partner NSA's more ambitious programmes, and \nneeded to make a more selective contribution. This made \neconomic sense, but GCHQ regarded such ideas as utterly \nunthinkable.sl The Hampshire review also raised the awkward \nquestion of 'overlap'. This was ultimately about the degree of \nmutual trust between GCHQ and NSA. GCHQ had often boasted \nthat there was complete exchange between the British and the \nAmericans, but when pressed hard it admitted that there was \nduplication of effort -even on the Soviet target. More impor\u00ad\ntantly, the head of K Division, which looked after non-Soviet \ntargets, acknowledged that there was 'considerable and \ninevitable overlap' in his province, and the British and the \nAmericans were duplicating much of their work on countries \nin the Middle East, Africa and Asia. 'The reason is we cannot \ntrust each other on sensitive matters,' he admitted. This was \nbecause British and American foreign policy diverged in these \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 223 \nregions. Inevitably, on intelligence relating to economic matters \nthere was almost no exchange at all. The Treasury demanded \n'more of a carve-up and less overlap'.82 \nHampshire's probe of sigint lasted several months, and \nincluded a six-week visit to the sprawling NSA headquarters at \nFort Meade that lasted into January 1963.83 Here, Hampshire \nwas briefed on the super-secret plans of NSA to expand sigint \ncollection using satellites like the highly successful 'Grab' \nlaunched in June 1960. He soon concluded that this was one \nroad GCHQ could not travel, since the costs of satellite opera\u00ad\ntions were prohibitive.84 This also reflected his worries about \npoor scientific recruitment at GCHQ.85 His work gave him insights \ninto some of the most secret activities of MI5 and SIS. He met \nthe MI5 officer Peter Wright to discuss GCHQ support for scien\u00ad\ntific efforts to locate the radios of KGB agents in Britain. \nHampshire was broadly supportive of this, but wished to wind \nup 'Airborne Rafter', the element of the operation conducted \nwith the help of the RAP's 51 Squadron, which was proving \nvery expensive. Wright, a zealous counter-espionage enthusiast, \nresisted, but eventually agreed with Hampshire that the flights \nwere not cost-effective.86 \nRemarkably, after much debate GCHQ got its money. After \n1962, the budgets of most of Britain's overseas departments \nwent down by 10 per cent, but the sigint budget went up by \nthe same amount. This was an astonishing victory delivered by \nClive Loehnis and his deputy Joe Hooper. They were greatly \nhelped by the fact that Burke Trend, a fan of secret service, \nmoved from the Treasury to replace Norman Brook as Cabinet \nSecretary in 1963. Trend and Hampshire had eventually \nconcluded that asking 'value for money' questions about intel\u00ad\nligence warning of a future Soviet attack, or indeed about what \nwas now a key element of the Anglo-American relationship, \nwas perhaps wrongheaded. These were core activities that Britain \nhad to continueY The Treasury's biggest worry was airborne \nsigint, which, as we shall see, remained a perennial problem \nfor decades to come.88 \n224 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nHampshire, having finished his labyrinthine task, left his chair \nat University College London for Princeton University in the \nautumn of 1963. Indeed, his recent sojourn with NSA in \nMaryland had allowed a little time for a preliminary visit to \nPrinceton in neighbouring New Jersey.89 Doubtless, he thought \nthis would be the end of his involvement in the shadowy world \nof intelligence. However, this was not the case. A few years \nlater he was visited by Peter Wright, the famed 'Spycatcher' of \nMI5. Wright had gradually discovered that while many of the \nmore notorious Soviet agents in Britain had been recruited \nthrough Cambridge by figures like Anthony Blunt, there was \nalso a more elusive Oxford ring, so he was now looking for \nfurther KGB moles. Remarkably, suspicion had fallen upon \nHampshire himself. \nThe irony was intense. Not only had Hampshire been selected \nto look at the innermost workings of the super-secret Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican code-breaking partnership, he had also presided over \ndecisions on technical support for Wright's own spy-catching \nactivities. Hampshire deals with this rather obliquely in his \nmemoir, recalling, 'Some of my friends who had also worked \nin secret intelligence during the war were shown to have been \nsecret agents of the Soviet Union.' He then adds: 'I was inter\u00ad\nrogated about them and their motives.' This is something of an \nunderstatement. During his time as an Oxford Fellow, then \nduring his wartime intelligence work, and yet again after the \nwar, Hampshire had continually moved in the circle of 'Stalin's \nEnglishmen'. Moreover, he himself had been directly under \nsllspicion.90 Amazingly, as an Oxford Fellow in the 1930s he \nhad known both Anthony Blunt and Guy Burgess rather well.9! \nIndeed, his friendship with Burgess went back to their time \ntogether at the elite Lockers Park prep school.92 After the war \nHampshire had moved to the Foreign Office for three years \nbefore returning to academia. There he worked in the private \noffice of Hector McNeil, the Assistant Under-Secretary of State, \nand shared an office with his old friend Guy Burgess.93 \nThe very idea that Hampshire might have been a KGB agent \nSHOOTDOWNS, CYPHERS AND SPENDING 225 \nwas unthinkable to the authorities. Accordingly, it was only in \n1967 that Wright finally secured permission to interview him \nat Princeton.94 To his obvious discomfiture Hampshire was inter\u00ad\nviewed a second time in 1970, but eventually Sir Dick White, \nthe distinguished head of SIS, concluded that the accusations \nagainst him were false. White was almost certainly correct. \nAlthough superficially left-wing, Hampshire was fundamentally \nconservative and a great believer in British institutions. Indeed, \nhis most famous philosophical work, on Spinoza and the nature \nof free will, implicitly rejected Marxist determinism. \nNevertheless, had his past friendships been known in 1962, it \nis unlikely that he would have been selected to review GCHQ.95 \nLater, when these issues were revealed to the public, \nHampshire complained about the 'hypocritical and slimy \nMcCarthyism of the press'. His wartime MIS colleague Herbert \nHart, also the subject of suspicion, hit out at the popular obses\u00ad\nsion with 'spy pornography'. The two men were representative \nof a wide circle of people, most of them honest toilers in the \nvineyards of intelligence, who had worked alongside Anthony \nBlunt, Guy Burgess and Kim Philby during the war, and now \nfelt distinctly uncomfortable. The end of the Macmillan era and \nthe arrival of Harold Wilson as Prime Minister in 1964 signalled \na change of climate. GCHQ was moving from an era of tight\u00ad\nlipped secrecy towards a period of revelations and further spy \nscandals. Turbulent waters lay ahead.96 \n12 \nHarold Wilson -Security Scandals and \nSpy Revelations \nThe result is the worst press any P.M. has had in my day ... \nCecil King, newspaper proprietor, 25 June 19671 \nFor British intelligence, the 1960s was a decade of cultural trans\u00ad\nformation. Journalists who had been brought up to respect \nwartime secrecy were discovering that Cold War espionage was \na hot subject. It had already burst onto the front pages with \nthe shooting down of Gary Powers' U-2 over Russia in May \n1960 and the CIA's ill-fated Bay of Pigs adventure in February \n1961, which attempted to unseat Fidel Castro in Cuba. The \nProfumo affair gripped the British public imagination in the \nsecond half of 1963, while the journalist Chapman Pincher broke \nthe news of Britain's secret access to overseas cables in what \nbecame known as the 'D-Notice affair' in 1967. The following \nyear was marked by the appearance of Kim Phil by's dishonest, \nbut delicious, autobiography, written after his defection to \nMoscow. \nHarold Wilson's first government was beset by security scan\u00ad\ndals. This was something he had fervently hoped to avoid. In \n1963, while still leader of the opposition, Wilson had enjoyed \ntaunting Harold Macmillan over the Profumo scandal, the Vassall \nspy case which involved a British civil servant passing naval \nsecrets to the Soviets, and Philby's defection. Macmillan resigned \na month after Lord Denning released his report on the Profumo \naffair, proof, if any were needed, that espionage and security \nwere areas of serious political liability. Having seen Macmillan \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 227 \nsquirm under investigation in the House of Commons, Wilson \nmade a mental note that, once in office, he would toughen up \non security in the hope of avoiding the same fate. He also devel\u00ad\noped an unhealthy fascination with security, and with MI5 in \nparticular.2 By the summer of 1963 his senior Shadow Ministers \nhad already detected the emerging Wilson hard line on secret \nmatters. Tony Benn noted in his diary: \n* Dick Crossman phoned this morning and we had a talk \nabout security. The Party is making a great fuss about this \nover the Vassall, Profumo and Philby cases ... I am afraid \nit's giving the impression that we want to institute a police \nstate. Dick, who worked for Intelligence during the war, is \na fierce security man and said that, as a Minister, he would \nthink it right that his phones should be tapped and all his \nletters opened. This is quite mad. I am terrified that George \nWigg may be made Minister for Security and given power \nover all our lives.3 \n* In October 1964 the general election swept Wilson to power \nand, much as Benn had predicted, George Wigg was given the \npost of Paymaster General, but with a modified remit, serving \nas Wilson's intelligence scout and security enforcer. Wigg was \na close friend of the Prime Minister, and his particular task was \nto probe the security arrangements of every department of state \nin the hope of protecting Wilson from Profumo-like incidents.4 \nWigg soon turned his attention to GCHQ, which he exam\u00ad\nined as part of a review of the Foreign Office, although he noted \nthat it was 'autonomous to a considerable extent'. The first thing \nthat struck him was the sheer size and complexity of the organ\u00ad\nisation. British sigint now employed some 1 L 500 staff, of whom \neight thousand were from GCHQ, while the other 3,500 were \nservice personnel. Indeed, the sigint personnel outnumbered the \nDiplomatic Service. Almost everyone at Cheltenham was now \nsubject to positive vetting except for a small number of ancil\u00ad\nlary staff. Despite the fact that GCHQ had a team of twenty-one \n228 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \ninvestigating officers who carried this out, there was a backlog \nof over a thousand staff, resulting in part from a large transfer \nof Radio Operators who had recently come over from the serv\u00ad\nices under civilianisation.s \nWigg was satisfied that the 'comintsums' and other types of \nsigint reports that were circulated to decision-makers were well \nprotected because of the tight security procedures laid down by \nUKUSA. He was also content that overall planning papers \nproduced at GCHQ were fairly secure. However, the specialist \nbranches produced a lot of working material that was not cata\u00ad\nlogued, and the existence of which was indeed only really \nknown to those who generated it. Tracking this was almost \nimpossible. Wigg was impressed by the new Director, Joe Hooper, \nwho had succeeded Loehnis, but less so by the Security Officer, \nWilliam Carey-Foster, who was approaching retirement. \nAlthough Michael Stewart, the Foreign Secretary, commended \nhis review, Wigg had in fact done a poor job. He had taken the \nsecurity procedures of the military intercept organisations that \nsupported GCHQ at face value, and did not bother to visit any \nof the overseas listening stations. It was these far-flung stations, \nas we shall see, that proved to be the weak links.6 \nWigg's lack of interest in the service-run intercept stations was \ndoubly surprising, since Berlin had seen its first British sigint \ndefection in 1963. Because of the Profumo affair, the newspapers \nbarely noticed the curious case of a Sergeant Brian Patchett, a \nsigint specialist who was serving with an obscure signals unit on \nthe outskirts of the British Zone of Berlin. Like one third of the \nservicemen in the Royal Signals, his trade was interception. \nPatchett had taken the Sigint Traffic Analysts Course in January \n1959, and later completed the Russian Linguist Voice Interceptor \nCourse. He had then been attached to GCHQ at Cheltenham \nbefore being sent to a listening unit run by 13 Signals Regiment \nat the Gatow airbase in Berlin. In both locations he was engaged \nin shift work, like the civilian Radio Operators who were now \nbeing transferred to GCHQ's controU However, Berlin was \nregarded as a difficult posting, and so remained militarised. \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 229 \nAfter his defection to the Soviets, Patchett's case was exam\u00ad\nined by John Drew with a view to extracting lessons from it. \nDrew had been an MIS 'Double Cross' officer during the war, \nhelping to mastermind the deception activities that cloaked the \nD-Day landings of 1944. In his opinion, the vetting arrange\u00ad\nments for the 'sensitive unit' to which Patchett had been assigned \nwere disastrously weak. Although Patchett was vetted on enlist\u00ad\nment, no interviews with his referees were undertaken, and \nreliance was placed on documents only. His positive vetting \nstatus was routinely reviewed in 1963, and he was promoted \nto the substantive rank of Sergeant on 20 June that year. He \ndefected to the Soviets only two weeks later, on 2 July. For \nDrew, the whole case turned on one fact: Patchett was known \nthroughout his unit to be a bed-wetter. Drew was astounded \nthat Patchett's commanding officer had discovered this halfway \nthrough his training in interception duties in 1960. Despite being \nreferred to a psychiatrist, Patchett was pronounced emotionally \nfit for duty. He did not defect to the Soviets because of any \nenthusiasm for Communism. He was simply miserable and \ndepressed in Berlin, and was considered 'a lone wolf with no \nparticular friends'. He had made four applications to be posted \nelsewhere, all of which were denied. As he explained to a \nGerman girlfriend of brief duration, when he decided to run \naway from the Army he simply found it easier to run east than \nto run west. There was a clear security failure here, since the \nservice personnel who collected sigint were not vetted to the \nsame level as the staff of GCHQ.B \nSigint specialists in Germany pored over the Patchett case, \nand rightly identified a system under pressure after the end of \nNational Service. A chronic shortage of security personnel had \nled to a breakdown in vetting. Interceptors were beginning their \nsigint training before they had even been negatively vetted, i.e. \nbefore MIS had run a simple background check for negative \nmaterial recorded in their files. They were even beginning oper\u00ad\national service in Germany and Cyprus before they had been \npositively vetted, and were offered little warning about the fact \n230 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nthat they might be approached by the KGB or the GRU. It was \nclear that they needed full briefings with real-life case studies. \nIssues like Patchett's 'bed-wetting' were always lurking in the \nbackground, and officials demanded a selection process that \nwould eliminate people with emotional disorders from duty in \nsensitive units.9 However, most of the sensible suggestions were \nundercut by the extreme shortage of sigint intercept personnel. \nSigint managers insisted that the idea of not posting servicemen \nunder the age of twenty-one to places like Berlin was just impos\u00ad\nsible. They also disliked the idea of some sort of special psychi\u00ad\natric assessment for sigint staff, which they thought would have \nan adverse effect on recruitment.lO Only the Army Intelligence \nCorps introduced psychological testing for all personnel on sensi\u00ad\ntive postings.ll \nEven as officials debated the Patchett case, further sigint secur\u00ad\nity disasters were in the making. In 1962 Douglas Britten, a \nthirty-year-old RAF technician, began a six-year spying career \nfor the Soviets. Britten was no ordinary RAF technician. He had \njoined the Air Force in May 1949, at the age of seventeen, and \nhad spent twenty years as sigint 'special operator' in some of \nthe most important collection stations. After initial training he \nwas sent to Habbaniya in Iraq between 1950 and 1953. He then \nworked briefly in Egypt, before returning home in 1954. He \nserved with 264 Signals Unit at Ayios Nikolaos in Cyprus between \n1956 and 1959, and then again between 1962 and 1966, before \nbeing posted to RAF Digby. There was little he did not know \nabout the business of sigint interception. Yet the serious nature \nof the Britten case was carefully hidden from the public, which \nwas not told about his real duties. The authorities were helped \nby the fact that he pleaded guilty, ensuring a short trial of which \nparts were held 'in camera' -away from the public gaze. \nBorn in Northampton in 1931, Douglas Britten came from a \ntroubled and impoverished background. In 1940 his father joined \nthe RAF and was posted to Bolton for training. There he struck \nup a relationship with a woman in the house where he was \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 231 \nbilleted. Britten, aged nine at the time, later recalled violent \nscenes between his father and his mother, who was a semi\u00ad\ninvalid. Eventually she decamped to live with his grandmother. \nAt fourteen, Britten was attending Wellingborough Junior \nTechnical College. However, money was short, so his mother \nwithdrew him from school and he went to work in a series of \ndull engineering jobs, where he learned little. By the time he \nwas seventeen he had developed an interest in radio, and was \nattending technical college in the evenings. The Air Force seemed \nan obvious avenue of escape. After his training he was posted \nto the RAF station at Hammersley Hayes in Cheadle, which had \ncontinued its wartime role as a key sigint collection site, and \nnow focused on the Soviet Air Force.12 \nBritten married a member of WRAF in 1953, and by 1956 \nthey had three daughters. However, there were continual prob\u00ad\nlems with accommodation and money. He recalled that by the \nlate 1950s 'I had begun to get into debt and arguments with \nmy wife became quite common: He even tried to get farm work \non the weekends around RAF Digby in Lincolnshire. Like \nPatchett before him, Britten was a rather inadequate individual \nin difficult personal circumstances who was often working in \nexposed locations. Exactly how the KGB identified him as a \nlikely recruit is not known. I3 However, he was an enthusiastic \nradio ham, and in late 1962, while visiting the Science Museum \nin London, he had been approached by a Russian who said he \nwas called 'Yuri'. Yuri claimed he was also a ham radio oper\u00ad\nator, and addressed Britten by his radio call-sign, 'Golf Three \nKilo Foxtrot Lima'. They chatted for a little about radios, and \nYuri asked Britten if he could obtain for him the operator's \nhandbook for a Racal 11 54 transmitter, as he was from Ukraine \nand obtaining it there was difficult. This seemed a fairly inno\u00ad\ncent request, since that radio was fairly out of date, and was \ncommercially available. They agreed to meet about a month \nlater at Southgate tube station. \nAt that next meeting, the sinister hallmarks of KGB trade\u00ad\ncraft were already visible. Britten recalled that Yuri 'walked past \n232 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nme and said to follow him at twenty-metre distances'. In a \nmanner very similar to the William Marshall case more than \nten years before, they then 'went all around the houses', the \nclassic procedure whereby a KGB officer tries to 'dry clean' \nhimself and check whether he is under surveillance. After a \nlong time Yuri bent down as if to tie his shoelace. He asked \nBritten if he had been able to obtain the operator's handbook, \nand Britten confessed that he hadn't. Yuri nevertheless handed \nhim an envelope containing \u00a31 o. Britten mentioned that he \nwas shortly to be posted to Cyprus, and Yuri responded by \nmaking arrangements for 'a friend' to meet him when he arrived \nthere. \nIn December 1962, Britten duly arrived in Cyprus. His KGB \ninstructions were to wait outside the Trianon Bar in Famagusta \nat two in the afternoon on the first Saturday of that month. \nAgain, classic trade craft was in evidence, with prearranged code \nwords. On the appointed day, just as Yuri had explained, his \n'friend' appeared and offered the agreed phrase: \n* 'Can you tell me the way to Desdemona's Gardens?' \nBritten replied: 'Go by taxi to the Land Gate in the old \ncity of Famagusta' \nThe KGB officer then responded: 'Greetings from Alex.' \n* Britten was asked to show up outside Barclays Bank at 5 o'clock \nthat afternoon. His new KGB controller, who called himself \n'Vasiley', turned up in a Ford Taunas with a Russian driver, and \nthey went for a long ride up the Panhandle in eastern Cyprus, \nbefore returning to Famagusta. Vasiley took things slowly, asking \nBritten about his family and his accommodation before giving \nhim an envelope with money and arranging to meet him again \ntwo months later, in February 1963.14 \nBritten now had second thoughts. Suddenly 'It really dawned \non me exactly what I was getting involved in and the conse\u00ad\nquences that would follow when and if I was found out.' He \nresolved to break off all contact with the KGB. However, he \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 233 \nfound himself getting into debt once more. His marriage was \nincreasingly troubled, and he had started to drink. He resumed \ncontact, and at the next meeting things turned nasty. Vasiley \nturned up with a woman who he introduced as his wife. The \nwoman, almost certainly another KGB officer, produced a photo\u00ad\ngraph of Britten receiving money from Yuri in London. They \nsaid that if he failed to cooperate, 'this photo would be sent to \nthe British intelligence services and I could expect some rough \ntreatment at their hands'. With a sinking feeling he realised that \nhe had been trapped. Everything he had been warned about in \nsecurity lectures came flooding back. He continued to meet his \ncontrollers every four months. All the time 'pressure was being \napplied'. The KGB had clearly identified him as a weak char\u00ad\nacter, and this was now a coercive relationship.I5 \nThe KGB demanded that Britten provide details of sigint activ\u00ad\nities, together with 'telecommunications information' on \nBritain's signals networks. He was given a Minox camera, a type \nmuch favoured by professional spies, and asked to take photos \nof the inside of his monitoring building, where the operators \nsat in serried ranks in headphones, but this proved difficult, \nsince he was never alone there. Pressure was put on him to \nidentify other vulnerable individuals. 'I was asked to note and \nreport the bad people in my unit,' he recalled, 'including offi\u00ad\ncers with mistresses: Vasiley also wanted to know whether 'any \nof my colleagues indulged in wife-swapping parties or any of \nthe wives prostituted themselves to English or local males'. Such \nindividuals would be ideal victims for future KGB efforts at \nblackmail. Britten said it would take him a while to discover \nthese things, but Vasiley seemed content, and replied: 'Time is \non our side, and we are in no hurry: Britten was clear in his \nown mind that he was being used as 'a spotter for potential \ntalent'. Eventually, he recalled, 'I passed my contacts the names \nof three airmen on my unit who could be recruited by them: \nHe also supplied general military intelligence, and spent much \ntime driving around the island collecting order of battle infor\u00ad\nmation at bases like Dhekelia.16 The transport he used was a \n234 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nbrand-new white Volvo, purchased with the proceeds of his \nundercover activities _. he also sported one of the latest cameras. \nQuizzed by his RAF colleagues about his newfound affluence, \nhe passed it off as a bequest from a recently deceased relative.17 \nHeavy drinking and adventurous sexual behaviour by signals \npersonnel on Cyprus were not unusual, and presented abiding \nsecurity problems for the authorities. Working long boring shifts \nand then returning to unbearably hot billets, operators had little \nto divert them during their spare time. In the 1960s Major Teddy \nThomas spent a long tour as a senior signals officer on Cyprus, \nand was a regular visitor to most of the communications units \non the island, including the sigint units at Episkopi and Ayios \nNikolaos. He recalls that a serious security incident occurred \nearly in 1963 involving some WRAC operators: 'It had long \nbeen suspected that some of them were practising lesbianism, \nbut that was a matter for their own officers until it came to \nlight that they had involved a young Greek girl in their orgies.' \nThe Greeks on the island were 'jealous of the chastity of their \nwomen', and if the affair came to the knowledge of their \nmenfolk, retribution was sure to follow. Thomas considered that \nthe lives of the WRAC operators involved were at risk. \nAccordingly, they were given an hour to pack their kit and \ndriven straight to Nicosia Airport to board an aircraft for home. \nOther staff became addicted to alcohol, which was cheap and \nplentiful on Cyprus. These activities offered opportunities for \nthe KGB, and Teddy Thomas was very much aware of the \nconstant attentions of Soviet intelligence on the island. One of \nhis other duties was ensuring the safe destruction of sensitive \ncypher equipment once it had worn out. He achieved this by \ntaking it out to sea and dumping it in six hundred fathoms of \nwater.IS \nDouglas Britten recalled that in 1964 Vasiley suddenly \nannounced that the KGB 'wanted to train me properly'. He was \ngiven a bag containing four items with designated hiding places. \nThese consisted of two empty Tennent's beer cans with false \nbottoms, marked 'One' and 'Tvvo', a piece of piping screwed at \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 235 \none end, and a magnetic box container. These were used for \npassing documents and money. The beer cans were marked \n'NAAFI Stores from HM Forces', and were to be left in a tele\u00ad\nphone box near the Municipal Stadium in Famagusta. The piping \nwas to be discarded casually near a ticket booth at the stadium, \nwhile the magnetic box was to be placed beneath a bench on \nthe road from the docks to the Army married quarters at \nFamagusta. In each case the containers were to be left for thirty \nminutes. Britten was then to look for a piece of crushed chalk \non the road. This was the sign that the device had been collected \nby the KGB.19 \nDuring his last year in Cyprus, Britten's relationship with the \nKGB fluctuated wildly. At times his controllers told him that \n'everybody was pleased', and brought him 'greetings from \nMoscow'. On one occasion they seemed to be offering him sex \nwith a Russian woman he had not met before. At other times \nthey made unpleasant threats. He recalled a meeting on a park \nbench at which he was warned that if his work did not improve \nthey would 'arrange for me to disappear and something would \nhappen to my family'. On another occasion he was 'pushed \nagainst a wall and punched several times in the head and body'. \nHe was told to improve his performance, since he had been \ngiven 'an awful lot of money'. The KGB wanted him to opt for \na sigint site in Germany as his next posting, but he told them \nthat the choice was not his. Throughout this time his objective \nwas 'to get as much money as I could to buy a house when I \ngot back home'. His posting in Cyprus would finish in October \n1966, and from the spring of that year the KGB began to prepare \nfor his return to Britain. There were elaborate procedures for \nmaking contact with his new KGB controller. On a particular \nSaturday in January 1967 he was to go to Brookdale Road in \nAmos Grove at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, carrying a copy of \nAutocar magazine. The KGB officer would enquire how to get \nto Edmonton cemetery, and Britten was to reply, 'You can catch \na 219 bus.' The Russian would then reply with the familiar \nphrase 'Greetings from Alex'. \n236 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nBut back in England, things started to go wrong. The KGB \nstill wanted sigint material, but they also wanted intelligence \nabout the most improbable things. They hoped that Britten could \nprovide information 011 the experimental TSR2 strike aircraft, \nand asked for detailed information about police radio frequen\u00ad\ncies in Leicestershire and Nottinghamshire. They also continued \ntheir love affair with elaborate espionage tradecraft. Britten was \ngiven a camera disguised as a cigarette case and three film \ncartridges, for photographing documents. Although he had one\u00ad\ntime pads and coding material, he was also assigned a dead\u00ad\nletter box, spy parlance for an innocent-looking place where \nmaterial could be deposited for collection by the KGB. This was \na hollow tree-stump near a signpost for Gypsy Lane in Harlow. \nFoolishly, Britten resisted the use of dead-letter boxes, and \ninsisted on personal contact with his handler, which was more \nrisky. He recalls that his controller did not like this, but even\u00ad\ntually he reluctantly agreed.2o His controller was called 'Yuri', \nbut was not the same Yuri he had met in London in 1962. He \nwas in fact Alexsandr Ivanovich Borisenko, whose cover was \nFirst Secretary at the Soviet Embassy.21 Yuri would signal his \ndesire for a meeting by sending Britten a copy of Autocar maga\u00ad\nzine via his mother's address. Sometimes his mother was slow \nforwarding the magazine, and he missed several meetings. He \nalso missed some of his radio signals, to Yuri's annoyance. Britten \nwas warned that the 'arm of the Soviet Secret Service was very \nlong and they had agents all over the UK', and that they would \n'only be too pleased' to act against him and his family. He later \nrecalled that he was 'very frightened' by this.22 \nEverything went wrong on 3 February 1968. Britten went to \nmeet his contact, but Yuri was not there. Britten recalled: 'My \ncontact did not turn up at our meeting for the first Saturday of \nthe month and so I went to the Bayswater Road and phoned \nthe Soviet Consulate. Later I went to a cafe and wrote a letter \nto my contact, saying I was desperate for money.' He hand\u00ad\ndelivered this letter to the Consulate, where he was \nphotographed from a covert MI5 observation post. Furthermore, \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 237 \nhis telephone call to the Soviet Consulate had almost certainly \nbeen intercepted. Thereafter, his angry KGB contact gave him \nmore money and instructions on how to arrange an emergency \nmeeting. This involved placing an innocuous notice in the \npersonal column of the Daily Telegraph. But Britten had already \ncompromised himself. 23 \nMIS was working frantically to identify the mysterious visitor \nto the Soviet Consulate. By August 1968 it had located Britten, \nand was working with RAF security teams to catch him 'red\u00ad\nhanded in the act of handing over classified information to his \nspy master'. When it failed to achieve this, GCHQ urged that \nBritten be arrested quickly, having decided that it was no longer \nreasonable to risk current sigint operations 'in the hope of getting \na clear-cut conviction'. MIS arrested him at 9 o'clock in the \nmorning of Wednesday, 11 September 1968 at RAF Digby. His \nhouse, office and car were vigorously searched in the hope that \nincriminating evidence would be found, as MIS knew that \nwithout it, it would be hard to make the charge of espionage \nstick.24 It was not disappointed. A cache of espionage apparatus \nwas recovered, including one-time pads and a timetable of Soviet \nradio broadcasts with call-sign frequencies. There were direc\u00ad\ntions for meeting with his KGB controller. There was also the \ncamera disguised as a cigarette case.2S \nOn 4 November Britten pleaded gUilty at the Old Bailey. Ever \nsince he had been recruited he had felt out of his depth. 'I feel \na great sense of relief at finally being caught,' he said, adding, \n'It is indeed a great relief to be able to talk about these activi\u00ad\nties: One of his motivations was clearly money. Although he \nclaimed that over the period of his espionage he received only \nabout \u00a3800, both MIS and the prosecution believed that the \ntrue figure was far more. He collaborated superficially with MIS, \nbut they concluded that he was telling less than the whole truth \nabout his activities, and he received a sentence of twenty-one \nyears' imprisonment. Alexsandr Borisenko left London for \nMoscow six days after Britten's first appearance in court.26 \nThe British public had been oblivious to Brian Patchett, and \n238 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nwere nat very interested in Douglas Britten. The extremely secret \nnature of Patchett's activities was never revealed, and Britten's \ndecision to plead gUilty ensured that his trial was not in the \npublic eye for long. Much more attention was paid to the sensa\u00ad\ntional escape of George Blake from Wormwood Scrubs Prison \nin October 1966. The authorities thought Blake had been sprung \nby the KGB; in fact he had been assisted by two peace \ncampaigners and an Irish Republican who thought his record \nsentence of forty-two years was inhumane. They provided Blake \nwith a rope ladder made from oversized knitting needles, and \nthen one of his friends smuggled him to East Berlin. The cover \nwas a family holiday: Blake was hidden in a VW camper van \ncomplete with children.27 \nThe British public knew he was an SIS officer, but were still \nunaware of his highly secret work with sigint. The Blake case \ncertainly reverberated for the Americans. In the White House, \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson's security advisers noted that \nBritish security was' disastrously porous', adding: 'We have had \nthe Fuchs, Burgess, Maclean, Lonsdale, Vassall and Philby parade \nto remind us: They argued that had Blake been subjected to a \npolygraph test when he returned from Korea, the problem might \nwell have been avoided. This was not the last time the Americans \nwould express a wish to see the polygraph adopted in Britain.28 \nOn 21 February 1967, to the dismay of GCHQ, sigint finally hit \nthe headlines in Britain as a result of what became known as \nthe 'D-Notice affair'. The Daily Express carried a sensational story \nby Chapman Pincher, its Defence Correspondent, about the \ngovernment interception of international telegrams and telexes, \na process known as 'cable vetting'. It described how all inter\u00ad\nnational telegrams and telexes were taken by the carrying \ncompanies to government offices for copying, before being sent \non their way. Although this traffic included telegrams sent by \nforeign embassies, the majority of it originated with private \ncompanies and ordinary members of the public. GCHQ was the \nrecipient of this material, although it was not directly mentioned \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 239 \nin the story, which incorrectly implied that the interested party \nwas MI5. \nThis affair rapidly became entangled in a heated political \ndebate over the mechanisms by which security-sensitive mat\u00ad\nerial was kept out of the British press. This was the 'D-Notice' \nsystem, a voluntary arrangement whereby a committee issued \nthe press with warning notices on stories that might damage \nBritish national security.29 Harold Wilson, whose relationship \nwith the press was already experiencing the classic downturn \nof mid-administration, reacted badly. He later observed that his \nclumsy handling of the D-Notice affair was 'one of my costliest \nmistakes of our near six years in office'.30 The Daily Express \ncontended that cable vetting was an instance of 'Big Brother' \nintrusion into private matters, 'which ranks with telephone \ntapping and the opening of letters'.31 Wilson denounced the \nstory in the House of Commons as 'sensationalised and inac\u00ad\ncurate', and attacked the Express for publishing it in open defi\u00ad\nance of the D-Notice system.32 \nWilson was quite wrong on the facts. In reality, the Permanent \nUnder-Secretary's Department, the section of the Foreign Office \nthat managed intelligence, had got wind of the story on 19 \nFebruary, two days before it was published, and had quickly \ndecided that it should be suppressed. Colonel Sammy Lohan, \nthe Secretary of the D-Notice Committee, was told to meet \nPincher and effect this. The next day, he and Pincher enjoyed \na long lunch during which Lohan explained that although he \nwas not keen on the piece being published, it would not actu\u00ad\nally be in breach of the D-Notice system. In other words, Lohan \nmuffed it. On the night before the article appeared, the Foreign \nSecretary was contacted in a panic by Denis GreenhilL Chairman \nof the Joint Intelligence Committee, and told about the \nimpending publication. Greenhill insisted that it would be 'very \nbad for the national interest', but he was far too late.33 \nUnder pressure from Edward Heath, the leader of the oppo\u00ad\nsition, Harold Wilson agreed to set up a committee of Privy \nCouncillors chaired by Lord Radcliffe, one of the Law Lords, to \n240 SPACE, Spy SHIPS AND SCANDALS \ninquire into the matter. Quite rightly, this cleared the Daily \nExpress of everything except a minor breach of etiquette. Wilson, \nhowever, egged on by George Wigg, denounced the Radcliffe \ninquiry which he himself had set up. Acting against the advice \nof his Cabinet Secretary, Burke Trend, he issued his own White \nPaper, criticising Radcliffe and insisting that the Daily Express \nhad deliberately published in defiance of the D-Notice system. \nHis Cabinet colleagues were appalled. 'He is going off his rocker,' \nremarked Barbara Castle, blaming Wigg for giving poor advice. \nMany other senior Ministers agreed.34 The whole affair was \nmade more poignant by the fact that, only months before, \nChapman Pincher had been given a major award as 'Journalist \nof the Decade', presented to him personally by Harold Wilson.35 \nOne historian has described Pincher's report in the Daily \nExpress as 'trivial'. 36 In fact it was anything but. Pincher had \nstumbled on a very secret story indeed. It was not only about \ninterception, something which had been hidden from the public \nfor decades, but also about a secret relationship between GCHQ \nand private companies like Western Union and Cable & Wireless. \nAlthough the British government holding in Cable & Wireless \nwas comparatively small, it effectively operated like a nation\u00ad\nalised industry. The tradition of handing over all its cable traffic \nto GCHQ and its antecedents went back to the First World War, \nand had continued undisturbed for half a century. As early as \n1944, when Cable & Wireless was thinking of sending more of \nits material by wireless, officials were quick to ask how this \nwould impact on 'monitoring'. The use of wireless, they noted, \nmight upset 'the present system in which the company \"plays \nball\" with the authorities concerned'. 37 \nThe other murky element of the D-Notice affair was the \nlinkage between the secret state and national economic inter\u00ad\nests. Cable vetting included the interception of a large number \nof commercial telegrams. One of the main customers for this \nsort of intelligence was Britain's Director of Economic \nIntelligence, Michael Kaiser, and his staff, which was located in \nthe Ministry of Defence. Kaiser was described by his superiors \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 241 \nas 'a man of enormous personal charm', but also 'a law unto \nhimself'. They went on to outline his duties: \n* A sizeable proportion of the work of his Directorate was \ndevoted to meeting the demands for information from the \nConfederation of British Industry. A further element went \ntowards producing a publication of such excruciating \nsecrecy that they were rarely if ever read by those many \nwho might best profit from them.38 \n* This publication was based on intercepts and, as was so often \nthe case with sigint, its very high value militated against its \nwidespread use. Security was especially tight with economic \nsigint, since this was almost never shared with Britain's UKUSA \nallies, especially the United States -Britain's military allies were \nher commercial rivals. \nAt precisely this moment, Burke Trend was busy revising \nBritain's central intelligence machinery to take more account \nof economic and scientific subjects, and indeed commercial \nrivalry. Clearly this was also meant to translate into stronger \neconomic intelligence targeted to support 'British interest and \ninvestments' at a time when Britain's economy was struggling. \nA second Joint Intelligence Committee was now created to focus \non economic, technological and scientific subjects. The \nPermanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence Services \nwas also expanded to include representatives from the Treasury, \nthe Department of Economic Affairs and the Board of Trade.39 \nThe Bank of England was not represented, but did have regular \naccess to material from GCHQ.40 Trend's changes to the central \nmachinery also included creating a new part-time post of Cabinet \nOffice Intelligence Coordinator, for which the illustrious Dick \nWhite, Chief of SIS, was selected as the first incumbent.41 \nWhite influenced the merger of Britain's independent comsec \nunit with GCHQ. It had recently been renamed the \nCommunications-Electronics Security Department after taking \nover some smaller technical outfits owned by the Post OfficeY \n242 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nGCHQ thought a merger would appeal to the sigint planners at \nNSA. All the other UKUSA countries had combined comsec/ \nsigint agencies, and it was hoped that a merger would ensure \n'continued harmoniolls Comsec relations' with the allies.43 \nMoreover, the controversial matter of 'free licensing' of cypher \nequipment for NATO countries cast a long shadow, and GCHQ \nfeared that in the future 'a conflict of interest might arise between \nComsec and Sigint' over this issue. At all costs it wished to avoid \narousing the suspicions of NSA, and a merger would reassure \nit.44 Another major factor was the shortage of skilled scientists.45 \nDick White believed that a merger would allow a better exchange \nof ideas, and would create a scientific research unit with crit\u00ad\nical mass. By 1973 GCHQ's Chief Scientist was serving as senior \nscientist for the whole British intelligence community.46 The \nmerger also strengthened the cover story that everyone at \nCheltenham was busy doing defensive communications \nresearch.47 The only opponent was the long-serving head of \ncomsec, Fred Stannard, who departed in dismay and was \nreplaced by Arthur Foden.4B \nBurke Trend and Dick White worked well together, but they \nwere confronted by many challenges. By the late 1960s British \nintelligence was facing a climate of increasing exposure and \nrevelation, and for some years .the press had considered espi\u00ad\nonage and security to be fair game for stories. Now, with jour\u00ad\nnalists like Chapman Pincher on the prowl and the additional \nexcitement caused by the publication of Kim Philby's memoirs \nin 1968, the floodgates were opening. Society was becoming \nless deferential, and newspapers were increasingly reluctant to \naccept an official definition of what constituted the national \ninterest. Harold Wilson's antagonistic relationship with the press, \nand his endless talk of conspiracies, made things much worse.49 \nIndeed, it was amazing that GCHQ had not been mentioned \npublicly during the course of the D-Notice affair. NSA was not \nso lucky: the previous year a series of articles on sigint in the \nNew York Times had revealed short-range collection from the \nSECURITY SCANDALS AND SPY REVELATIONS 243 \nAmerican Embassy in Moscow, as well as satellite interception \nof the car phones with which Politburo-level Zillimousines were \nequipped as they sped around Moscow.5o \nAbove all, the Vietnam War served as a focus for dissent on \nboth sides of the Atlantic, and crystallised the sense of genera\u00ad\ntional change. Everywhere established authority and conven\u00ad\ntional attitudes were being challenged. The spring of 1968 was \nmarked by violent anti -war protests on the streets in Washington, \nLondon and Paris. In the early summer of that year, Joseph \nWenger, one of NSA's most senior code-breakers, confided in a \nclose friend and fellow naval officer that his children did not \nrespect his service to his country, and had complained that he \nwas engaged in a 'shady business'. This had clearly upset him. \nHis friend remarked that Sir Dick White had recently received \nexactly the same reaction from his own children when his posi\u00ad\ntion as Chief of SIS was revealed by the press. White's rejoinder \nwas a good one. He reportedly asked his children, 'Do you \nconsider me to be any less good a husband and father and good \ncitizen?' Upon reflection, his children admitted that they 'guessed \nnot'. Nevertheless, the spirit of the age was presenting new chal\u00ad\nlenges for intelligence officers everywhere.5l \n13 \nIntelligence for Doomsday \nIn March to August 1968 the JIC consistently took the view that \nthe USSR was unlikely to invade Czechoslovakia. \nDouglas Nicoll, Internal Report on the lIC \nand Warning of Aggression I \nDuring the early hours of 21 August 1968, Soviet forces invaded \nCzechoslovakia. Accompanied by troops from three other Warsaw \nPact countries, their purpose was to crush the 'Prague Spring', \na liberalising tendency within the Eastern Bloc which Moscow \nconsidered dangerous. Czech youths threw petrol bombs at Soviet \ntanks as they moved through the streets of Prague. Buses were \nset ablaze, and protesters finally massed in Wenceslas Square. \nElsewhere, students actually climbed onto Soviet tanks to argue \nwith their drivers. However, the Czech Army stayed in their \nbarracks, and there was no serious fighting. Within a day, \nAlexander Dubcek, the reformist leader, and his colleagues were \non their way to a KGB compound in the Carpathian Mountains. \nMoscow rationalised its move on the basis of the 'Brezhnev \nDoctrine', which asserted the right to prevent any member state \nfrom leaving the Warsaw Pact. The Red Army, which had not \nhitherto been stationed on Czech soil, arrived in force and \nremained as uninvited guests all the way through to 199 I.2 \nThe best possible sources on Soviet intentions towards \nCzechoslovakia during the summer of 1968 were the ultra-secret \nshort-range sigint stations hidden in the British and American \nEmbassies in Moscow. These were able to scoop up a variety of \ninteresting telephone calls, including those made from the cars \nof the senior Soviet leadership. Code-named 'Gamma-Guppy', \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 245 \nthis material was given a very limited circulation. However, the \nSoviets were aware of these operations, and were careful about \nwhat they said on the phone. In mid-August, Marshal Andrei \nGrechko, the Chief of Warsaw Pact armed forces, had been flying \nto various Eastern Bloc capitals to assess opinion on an inva\u00ad\nsion. On his return, he called Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet \nPremier, from Moscow Airport. However, he spoke in a pre\u00ad\narranged code, and no one in Western intelligence knew if this \ncryptic conversation meant the invasion was on or ofP \nFor the British, the Soviet invasion was an intelligence disaster \nof the first order. Dick White, who had just been appointed as \nBritain's first Cabinet Office Intelligence Coordinator, was horri\u00ad\nfied by the failure of the lIC to offer any warning that it was \nimminent. The Defence Secretary Denis Healey and the Chief \nof the Defence Staff also subjected the recently created Defence \nIntelligence Staff, with its specific warning role with regard to \nSoviet military actions, to severe criticism. Dick White set up a \nsmall committee to look into the workings of the DIS, and \nindeed for a while 'its very future seemed fraught with peril'.4 \nConclusions were soon reached. 'Dick White asserted that in \n1968 the DIS had been correct in their forecast of the Czech \ninvasion by the Soviets, whereas the FCO [Foreign and \nCommonwealth Office] and the Friends [SIS] had been wrong.' \nSigint had not provided a clear warning, and had been unable \nto distinguish invasion preparations from routine Warsaw Pact \nmilitary exercises. By contrast, defence sources had the real \ninformation, and so the DIS had come to the right conclusion. \nHowever, as White put it, the DIS's 'cutting edge' had not been \nsharp enough to persuade the lIC.5 \nAlthough sigint had not offered a definitive warning, Britain \nhad excellent assets on the ground. A team of British military \nliaison officers known as 'Brixmis' who were stationed in East \nGermany under a long-standing agreement with the Soviets \nhad been watching the Red Army as it mobilised for a 'major \nexercise'. The classic question these observers confronted was \nwhether this was an exercise, a bluff, or a real invasion. The \n246 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nfabulous anthropological knowledge that Brixmis had devel\u00ad\noped over twenty years of watching its subject provided the key \nwarning indicator. It had observed the Red Army going out on \nexercise countless times, and knew how it behaved. A routine \nexercise provided an opportunity to leave broken or faulty \nvehicles in barracks to be worked on by engineers. What marked \nthis out as the 'real thing' was that the Soviets took everything \nwith them. Vehicles were piled high with personal effects, \nshowing that the troops were not expecting to come back for \nsome time. Unserviceable vehicles were also taken. Indeed, there \nwere so many of these that the Soviets ran out of towing chains, \nand made makeshift ones by plaiting fence chains together. This \nwas a small detail, but to the expert watchers of Brixmis it spoke \nvolumes. The Soviets were definitely up to something.6 \nWhy did the JIC get the invasion of Czechoslovakia so badly \nwrong, despite such excellent indicators? Quite simply because \nits chairman, a rather lofty diplomat called Denis Greenhill, \nrefused to accept the evidence that was staring him in the face. \nHe insisted that the Soviet mobilisation was only an attempt to \napply psychological pressure, and argued that if he was in the \nSoviets' shoes he would think the wave of international criti\u00ad\ncism an invasion would provoke too high a price to pay. In other \nwords, he thought like a British decision-maker, not a Russian \none - a classic example of a basic analytical mistake called 'mirror\u00ad\nimaging'. The CIA made much the same mistake, and only the \nWest Germans accurately predicted the invasion. After the \ninquiry, Dick White decided to beef up the Defence Intelligence \nStaff. His chosen instrument was the redoubtable Admiral Louis \nLe Bailly, whom he made Director General of Intelligence, or \n'DGI', at the Ministry of Defence. The DGI became Deputy Chair \nof the Joint Intelligence Committee, sitting alongside the senior \nmilitary intelligence officer, who was already a member of the \ncommittee. The DGI was also boosted with his own personal \nstaff. Thereafter, the diplomats and the military fought for control \nof Britain's central intelligence machinery.7 \n* * * \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 247 \nIn the late I960s the West had launched a charm offensive \ntowards the Eastem Bloc called 'detente', which aimed to \nencourage precisely the liberal tendencies that Brezhnev had \nnow cracked down on. The invasion of Czechoslovakia in August \n1968 did not derail Western efforts to pursue detente. However, \nit did raise awkward questions. NATO forces had presumed a \ngood degree of warning of any Soviet attack on the West, but \nwould they actually receive this warning if a Third World War \nbroke out? The invasion also prompted British commanders in \nGermany to think harder about intelligence in the first anxious \nhours of a confrontation between East and West. Although \nBrixmis provided a fabulous source of both operational and \ntechnical intelligence, it was a peacetime mission and was \nexpected to be rounded up before any military action took place. \nThereafter, commanders would need a reliable source of intel\u00ad\nligence. Their primary need was to track the movement of the \nmain Soviet thrusts, together with reinforcements mustering \nanything up to three hundred miles to the rear. In a future war, \nBritish commanders would hope to disrupt the Warsaw Pact's \nemerging battle plan and destroy its momentum. The most \ndemanding task would be surveillance well behind the enemy \nfront line. \nOne might have expected senior British commanders to have \nturned to sigint and GCHQ. Instead, during the 1960s those in \nGermany seem to have rejected the wonders of electronic moni\u00ad\ntoring in favour of the least technical option, human recon\u00ad\nnaissance from 'stay-behind patrols'. This was often referred to \nin the local parlance of hardy special forces soldiers as 'the Mk.1. \nEyeball'. From the onset of any future war, intelligence inside \nthe Soviet-occupied areas would have been provided by dedi\u00ad\ncated stay-behind parties from NATO special forces. Prevailing \ndoctrine suggested that these special forces had several deep\u00ad\npenetration roles in wartime. These included the collection of \nintelligence by active or passive methods, offensive operations \nby small parties, cooperation with partisans or guerrillas, and \nassistance to escapers such as downed pilots. However, in the \n248 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \ncontext of a global war, intelligence was deemed to be the \npredominant task of SAS-type units. The only sabotage-type \nactivities that were considered important were efforts to destroy \nenemy nuclear weapons or missile sites.8 This emphasis on intel\u00ad\nligence reflected a growing anxiety that Warsaw Pact forces \nmight move too fast to allow sigint or air reconnaissance to \nprovide effective targeting intelligence for NATO artillery, and \neventually tactical nuclear strikes. Everyone knew that NATO \ncommanders would press for early deployment of nuclear \nweapons, for fear that Warsaw Pact units would deliberately \nmove close to their opponents, making the use of tactical nuclear \nweapons increasingly difficult.9 \nIn the 1960s the British Army on the Rhine developed a \nsecret new force for this important intelligence role. This \ninvolved adding a Special Reconnaissance Squadron from the \nRoyal Armoured Corps to strengthen 23 SAS Regiment. During \nan initial alert, the Special Reconnaissance Squadron was \nexpected to hold the fort until the arrival of 23 SAS, which \nwould be flown in from Britain. These units were on short \nreadiness times: their unofficial motto was 'Wait and Fly -Dig \nand Die'.lD After the arrival of 23 SAS the two formations were \nto operate as a single unit, giving priority to sightings of 'nuclear \nunits, formation HQs, armour, and bridging and ferrying equip\u00ad\nment'. Their main task would be to provide the target intelli\u00ad\ngence for battlefield missile systems and heavy artillery. \nThese special units were based at Padeborn in central \nGermany, and were equipped with high-frequency Morse to \nprovide long range and, hopefully, continued communications. \nThe expected onrush of Warsaw Pact tanks meant there was \nno need for them to practise skills to penetrate the enemy front \nline. Instead, the drill was to move forward quickly, by any \navailable soft transport, such as three-ton trucks. Special forces \nwould eventually meet the units tasked as the delaying force, \nand as these elements withdrew, the special forces would stay \nbehind. Preparations for such operations had become quite elab\u00ad\norate by the late 1960s, with pre-identified hides offering good \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 249 \nfields of observation over likely routes of advance for the Red \nArmy, and some pre-positioned SAS stocks which had been \nburied underground. Much of this activity was focused on what \ncommanders referred to as the 'demolition belt'. These were \n'killing zones', some way east of the Rhine, where it was hoped \nthat bottlenecks would occur amongst aggressor forces twenty\u00ad\nfour hours or so after the Warsaw Pact forces had attacked. II \nSome special forces units were equipped with Atomic \nDemolition Munitions (ADMs) which it was hoped would slow \nthe advance of Soviet armour. The US special atomic demoli\u00ad\ntion munitions programme appears to have been code-named \n'Green Light', and was active from the mid-1960s to the mid-\n1980s. In 1960 Sergeant Major Joe Garner of US Army Special \nForces was probably the first person to make a parachute jump \nwith a small atomic weapon, which was strapped to his body \nduring a field exercise.12 Although ADMs posed serious prob\u00ad\nlems of contamination because they would have generated a \ngreat deal of fallout, they were nevertheless popular with mili\u00ad\ntary planners, since they were considered to be more defensive \nand less escalatory than other types of tactical nuclear weapons. 13 \nBy 1971, Britain appears to have been moving ahead with its \nown ADM programme, designated 'Project Clipeus'; however, \nits full extent is still shrouded in secrecy. Clipeus was a James \nBond-type suitcase nuclear weapon, which even now seems to \nhave more in common with spy fiction than reality. 14 \nDepending on a few soldiers for the targeting of nuclear \nartillery and key battlefield missile systems such as 'Corporal' \nand 'Honest John' during the first few hours of war was an \nobvious weakness in British plans, and there were increasing \nconcerns about the potential vulnerability of such troops. An \nextensive programme of research was carried out during 23 \nSAS's annual autumn training exercise held in Germany, code\u00ad\nnamed 'Badger's Lair'. Eight SAS teams were deployed on the \nSoltau training area, while British Army signals teams played \nthe role of the KGB and conducted elaborate tests to investi\u00ad\ngate their vulnerability to Soviet intercept and direction-finding \n250 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nprocedures. RAF units tested concealment procedures by over\u00ad\nflying the SAS hides with thermal-imaging cameras and mono\u00ad\nchrome photography. Vulnerability to searches by dog patrols \nwas also tested. To the dismay of the SAS, of the thirty-nine \nhides they created, all but two were found within the first six \nhours. The patrols and dogs proved highly effective, but even \nmore remarkable was the success of electronic warfare sensor \nvehicles. To the surprise of the research teams, these intercepted \nnot only Morse code but also burst-encrypted traffic, produced \nby a special radio that stored a message and then sent its entire \ncontents in less than a second, to try to defeat enemy listeners. \nDirection-finding bearings were achieved at ranges of up to \ntwelve kilometres, and accurate bearings using triangulation \nbetween three vehicles at ranges of five kilometres. 15 The ability \nto track burst transmissions was especially alarming, and \nprompted a decision to develop better communications equip\u00ad\nment for stay-behind parties.16 \nThis heavy dependence on SAS-type activities raises profound \nquestions about sigint. After all, it had been a key source of \nreal-time operational intelligence during the Second World \nWar, and as we have seen, had continued to be important in \nsmall conflicts such as the Confrontation in Borneo. British \ncommanders in Germany enjoyed their own significant sigint \nand electronic warfare capability, which was directed by an \nIntercept Control Centre. In time of war there would have \nbeen some additional sigint from airborne collection, albeit \nthese planes' main role would have been to support the British \nV-bombers. The backbone of this was 225 Signals Squadron, \nwhich was tasked to support British forces in Germany. These \nunits had provided an invaluable intelligence contribution in \npeacetime through their work on the Soviet order of battle. \nOver the years, operators had learned the radio signatures of \nindividual Soviet units, allowing them to learn a great deal \nabout each distinct formation. However, these tactical sigint \nunits themselves felt that their very success in peacetime had \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 251 \nled to a dangerous overestimation of their likely contribution \nin any future war. They observed: \n* In a war of limited duration in NW Europe, if the stan-\ndard of security in WP [Warsaw Pact] communication links \nis good, the timely intelligence and useful steerage that \n225 can provide will be very small ... The problem ... is \nnot so much one of equipment quantities but rather the \ndifficulty of conducting EW [Electronic Warfare] in a highly \nmobile tactical environment ... The wartime limitations of \n22 5 Signal Squadron are not widely known; as a result the \nsquadron's capabilities are overrated. \n* Electronic warfare was one of -the few planned intelligence \nsources for determining the location of enemy headquarters. \nYet sigint specialists feared that the Soviets might be routinely \n'remoting' the radios associated with their major headquarters, \nat a distance of perhaps two kilometres, in which case the effec\u00ad\ntiveness of any direction-finding efforts would be drastically \nreduced. Their only hope was that under the stress of war, \nWarsaw Pact communications security might lapse, but this was \nby no means certain. Indeed, some predicted that for the first \ntwenty-four hours the enemy might advance on predesignated \nlines and keep near radio silenceP \nSenior British officers clearly hoped that their tactical sigint \norganisation would provide some information on enemy deploy\u00ad\nment patterns as well as intentions in the first few hours of \nwar. They also desired information on the 'location of enemy \nheadquarters and missile launching sites'. However, in reality \nonly the smaller missile-launching sites were likely to be within \nintercept range, while the more important SCUD missile sites \nwould be outside the typical operating range of tactical sigint, \nwhich was forty to fifty kilometres. British commanders were \nintrigued by the American decision to introduce airborne tactical \nsigint systems on light aircraft, but noted that these would have \nto fly far from the battle area in order to surviveY In fact, this \n252 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nAmerican system -known as 'Guardrail' - proved highly effec\u00ad\ntive.19 The deploym~nt of these small sigint aircraft reflected \ngood previous experiences with the U-2s which had undertaken \nregular perimeter sigint flights around the Eastern Bloc.20 \nThe biggest limitation on Britain's local ground-based sigint capa\u00ad\nbility was range of intercept. Warsaw Pact command and control \nused VHF radio, and this could only be heard at a maximum \ndistance of forty or fifty kilometres. This reflected both trans\u00ad\nmitter power and also the need for line-of-sight interception. \nAccordingly, it was possible to provide adequate comint to divi\u00ad\nsional commanders, but problems would occur at the level of \ncorps and above, which needed to see further behind the front \nline. In short, sigint on Warsaw Pact reserve divisions would \nhave arrived too late for the commander of British forces in \nGermany to react to it. Limitations of range also required sigint \ncollectors to be based as far forward as possible, exposing them \nto risk and forcing them to move frequently, which was not \n'conducive to the best COMINT collection',21 General pessimism \nwas reinforced by the knowledge that at the level of divisional \nheadquarters and above, Soviet communications security was \nexcellent. In 1969, the monitoring of large-scale Soviet exer\u00ad\ncises showed that their ability to 'successfully use communica\u00ad\ntions security measures results in lean intelligence collected by \nthe SIGINT organisation'.22 \nIt was only during the mid -1970s that new technology began \nto provide good alternative sources. Unattended ground sensors, \nsmall electronic devices which detected the movement of vehi\u00ad\ncles, began to become available in Europe. Initially trialled in \nVietnam under the 'Igloo White' programme, by the early 1980s \nthese had become a formidable intelligence instrument. Many \nof the early models -nicknamed 'bump-counters' -were tested \nduring real Warsaw Pact exercises in Eastern Europe, having \nbeen put in position by Brixmis personnel.23 Had war broken \nout prior to 1970, British commanders in Germany would also \nhave turned to traditional air reconnaissance using aircraft with \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 253 \ncameras.24 However, this source of intelligence would have \ndiminished quickly, because a horrendous aircraft casualty rate \nof 60 per cent was expected in the first week of any war with \nRussia.25 Both captured enemy documents and PoW interroga\u00ad\ntion were unlikely to be helpful in a fast-moving war.26 \nDid all this planning for a future war matter? After all, deter\u00ad\nrence was supposed to ensure that the north German plains \nwould remain the Cold War's frozen front, with little likelihood \nof real conflict. In fact, by the early 1960s a number of crises \nhad created a climate of growing anxiety. Confrontations over \nBerlin and Cuba, together with the escalating conflict in Vietnam, \nmade war seem somewhat closer. Alarmingly, American sigint \nhad failed to give much warning about the emerging Cuban \nMissile Crisis in 1962. The Six-Day War in 1967 and the inva\u00ad\nsion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 were also unsettling for \ncommanders. More generally, throughout the 19605 there was \na growing awareness that NATO's conventional inferiority in \nnumbers, especially in northern Germany, might call for the \nearly use of nuclear weapons to stem the tide of a Warsaw Pact \nattack. A better intelligence flow was required, not only for \nwarning, but also for decision-making in any nuclear crisis.27 \nIndeed, in 1968, even before the invasion of Czechoslovakia, \nLondon and Washington began thinking the unthinkable. Up \nuntil recently, sharing anything other than the lowest level of \nsigint with the European allies had been anathema. However, \nthey now considered upgrading the flow of sigint to the new \nNATO political headquarters that had just moved to the outskirts \nof Brussels. Bill Millward, Director of Requirements at GCHQ, \nhad already been out to Brussels for talks with British officials \nthere. However, these plans were plagued by repeated espionage \nflaps at NATO. In the autumn of 1968 the CIA secured a major \ncounter-espionage coup when it recruited Colonel Ion Iacobescu, \nthe deputy head of the Paris station of the Romanian foreign \nintelligence service (known as DGIE). Iacobescu revealed that \nhis boss in Paris, Mihai Caraman, was running two high-grade \n254 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nspies inside NATO's Brussels headquarters. One of them was a \nTurkish staff officer, Colonel Nahit lmre, who had been recruited \nby DGIE in Ankara, and had been controlled from Paris since \nhis appointment as Deputy Financial Controller of NATO. The \nother had been recruited by Caraman himself. This was Fran<;ois \nRoussilhe, who worked as Head of Translation in the NATO \nregistry. The KGB had been so impressed by Caraman's enter\u00ad\nprise that it sent one of its own top officers, Vladmir Arhipov, \nto work alongside him in Paris. Once Caraman's deputy defected \nto the West, everything began to unravel,28 \nIn late 1968 Nahit lmre was publicly revealed to be an agent \nof the Romanian intelligence service.29 Once he had been inter\u00ad\nrogated, his disposal was left to the Turkish authorities. His \ndeparture was monitored by the British security team at NATO, \nwho reported that 'when he went on board the Turkish aircraft \nhe was closely followed by two Turkish \"gorillas\" '. He was tried \nsecretly in Turkey, and executed by firing squad the following \nyear.30 In London, the lmre case caused real consternation. \nRonnie Burroughs of the Foreign Office immediately saw the \nconnection betweel1 this case and the recent decision to improve \nsigint for NATO, and wrote to the senior UK representative on \nthe North Atlantic Council asking 'whether we are right to \nproceed with our plans to set up an all-NATO GCHQ cell at \nEvere [near Brussels]'.3\\ London eventually decided to press \nahead, but was clearly unsettled.32 \nIn early 1969, NATO turned to deal with the Roussilhe case. \nFran<;ois Roussilhe was a French employee of the international \nstaff who had worked for NATO since 1952, and had gradually \nrisen to be Chief Clerk of the Document Translation Centre. \nSince 1963 he had provided the Romanian intelligence service \nwith at least five thousand NATO documents, induding top\u00ad\nsecret material. His motives had apparently been purely mat\u00ad\nerialistic: he had been paid in cash -largely in gold -and up \nto date had received around a million French francs.33 The UK \nChiefs of Staff took a 'very grave view' of these penetrations, \nand were determined that they should not be swept under the \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 255 \ncarpet. There were many voices in London now arguing that \nBritain was putting its own forces at risk by passing too much \ninformation to NATO.34 \nThe experienced MI5 representative on NATO's Special \nCommittee, Dick Thistlethwaite, had wanted to run Roussilhe \nas a deception agent 'to confuse or reduce Soviet assessment' \nof the information it had received. MI5 went so far as to propose \na 'NATO disinformation cell' that would actually turn weak \nNATO security into an advantage. The British sensed an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to repeat the fabulous achievements of the wartime \nDouble-Cross Committee and the famous D-Day deception. \nHowever, this was blocked by the CIA, which disliked the sheer \norganisational complexities of doing such a thing in Brussels. \nThe British complained that the CIA was timid, and that \n'Roussilhe was a lost opportunity'. 35 \nThe greatest damage caused by these agents was the compro\u00ad\nmise of operating procedures for nuclear command and control \nmechanisms. At the same time the British accepted that where \nmore general political policy on nuclear weapons was concerned, \nthere was an avant-garde school of thought which held that 'we \nshould ensure sufficient leakage in order to induce the Soviets to \nenter the dialogue at this point in our discussions'. Over a hundred \ncopies of Nuclear Planning Group documents were routinely \ndistributed in English and French, and many regarded these as \neffectively open documents that would soon reach Moscow. 36 \nRemarkably, notwithstanding the repeated security breaches in \nthe late 1960s, the GCHQ cell for NATO at Evere went ahead. \nWithout a flow of sigint, NATO's Military Committee was increas\u00ad\ningly an obstacle to rapid mobilisation in time of crisis. This was \nillustrated by a strategic alert in early August 1969, triggered \nalmost entirely by sigint. Monitoring of Soviet units by GCHQ \ndetected an unusual lull in air activity, combined with what \nseemed to be pre-orders for large-scale troop movements. There \nhad also been a slight rise in signal activity on the Soviet General \nStaff network. The intelligence suggested 'preparations of a \n256 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nhighly unusual character' in Russia and other Eastern Bloc coun\u00ad\ntries. The JIC thought the most likely explanation was an \nimpending Soviet move inside Eastern Europe, against Romania \nor possibly Yugoslavia. There was even an outside chance of an \nattack on China.37 The signals traffic between Moscow and the \nStrategic Air Command, the Navy and the Strategic Rocket Force \nremained normal, so all intelligence agencies were convinced \nthat the Soviets were not contemplating hostile action against \nNATO. Nevertheless, the British Chiefs of Staff found this pattern \nof Soviet activity 'unusual and disturbing'. They suggested that \nat the very leas~ there should be some response from NATO, \n'so that the Russians would be made aware that we knew of \ntheir activities'. They asked General Andrew Goodpaster, the \nSupreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), who was in \ncharge of all NATO forces in Europe, about the possibility of \nsending such a signal to the Soviets, ideally by covert means.38 \nOn 10 August 1969 Britain instituted a covert mobilisation \nin collaboration with SACEUR, making war preparations, but \nonly insofar as they would not be publicly visible or cause alarm. \nBorder patrols were increased, and all RAF combat aircraft in \nGermany were dispersed. Battle-flight practice missions were \nflown, and all personnel were brought to two hours' notice of \nreadiness. However, efforts to stimulate NATO's Military \nCommittee into action were again frustrated by the difficulties \nover the release of sigint.39 This was explained to Denis Healey, \nthe Defence Secretary, by one of his senior officials. The NATO \nMilitary Committee had suffered 'paralysis' on this occasion \n'because some of its members were not allowed to see the rele\u00ad\nvant intelligence material', since much of it was sigint and so \nwas CAN/UK/US Eyes Only. He added: 'As early warning will \nvery often be of the COMINT sort we could obviously meet \nsimilar difficulties again, and perhaps in more serious circum\u00ad\nstances.' By 12 August, further sigint collected from Hong Kong \nsuggested an easing of the immediate situation. However, the \nissue of NATO sigint had now been identified as an 'unfortu\u00ad\nnate state of affairs' that simply had to be addressed.40 \nINTELLIGENCE FOR DOOMSDAY 257 \nThe GCHQ cell at NATO also went ahead because of the \nrecommendations of the Working Group on Sigint set up by \nNATO's Special Committee. This suggested that the cell might \nfocus only on intelligence that might influence war warning \nand 'a timely decision to release nuclear weapons'. Sigint for \nNATO was specifically about intelligence during the critical \nperiod between the beginning of a crisis and a request for the \nrelease or use of nuclear weapons. In other words, there was \nnever any intention to supply NATO with a broad range of sigint \nunder normal peacetime conditions. Instead, the new arrange\u00ad\nments for sigint only sought to regularise the position that had \noccurred during the Middle East War of 1967, when GCHQ and \nNSA had provided NATO with most of its intelligence, requiring \nthe laborious production of specially tailored documents that \nprovided detail on the situation, while hiding its source.41 In \n1971, continued anxiety about a possible Soviet invasion of \nRomania or Yugoslavia prompted the American decision to ask \nthe British to be allowed to run regular SR -71 Blackbird spy\u00ad\nplane missions from RAF Mildenhall, providing the ability to \ncollect imagery and sigint at short notice.42 \nOffsetting some of these anxieties, the late 1960s saw the begin\u00ad\nning of arms control agreements and confidence-building meas\u00ad\nures that were only possible because of intelligence. Improved \nintelligence from satellites and sigint gave both sides more faith \nin these agreements. In this way, espionage activities of all kinds \nseem to have made the international system more stable by the \nlate 19605. Arguably, the emergence of a regime of reassuring \nmeasures, with its emphasis on the avoidance of crisis, also \nreflected a growing recognition that the command systems on \nboth sides were fundamentally ill-suited to rapid decision\u00ad\nmaking under pressure. Some British officials had even begun \nto recognise that, taken together, the intelligence efforts of both \nsides contributed to a collective calming of nerves. Indeed, during \nthe 1960s the penetration of the NATO registries by Eastern \nBloc spies was so complete that the Warsaw Pact had no choice \n258 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nbut to conclude that the intentions of Western countries were \ngenuinely defensive and benign.43 Yet no amount of espionage \never provided complete reassurance. Accordingly, there was little \nrespite for the intelligence agencies, and by the late 1960s ever \ngreater resources were poured into the increasingly high-tech \nworld of sigint and satellites.44 \n14 \nStaying Ahead -Sigint Ships \nand Spy Planes \n. .. no other European NATO countries will have purpose-built \naircraft for Sigint collection. \n'Nimrod (R)\" enclosed in Frank Cooper, Ministry of \nDefence, to Defence Secretary Denis Healey, 30 July 19681 \nBy the 1960s the British Empire was shrinking fast. Most of \nAfrica was moving rapidly towards independence, and sigint \nbases in Iraq, Egypt and Ceylon had gone, with much activity \nbeing pulled back to Cyprus. Now even Cyprus looked precar\u00ad\nious, under pressure from local guerrillas who were campaigning \nfor union with Greece. However, there seemed to be a possible \nanswer to this looming problem: to place one of the large over\u00ad\nseas monitoring stations on dedicated sigint ships. This would \nrender it immune to the ploys of post-colonial politicians who \nwished to twist the tail of the British lion over base rights. It \nwould also permit flexibility, since a floating base could be \nmoved, providing emergency monitoring during the Cold War \ncrises that increasingly erupted in the Third World. These new \n'sigint ships' would also help Britain to remain one of the world's \nleading intelligence powers. \nSigint ships were not new. The aircraft carrier HMS Albion \nand the cruiser HMS Superb had been on prolonged sigint cruises \nin the Baltic as early as 1949; moreover, a number of naval \nfrigates had listening suites installed. Also, as we have seen, \nseveral British submarines Were modified for intelligence duties \nand undertook hazardous monitoring operations against Soviet \nnaval bases. There were also listeners on fishery protection \nvessels and trawlers. However, these were small teams of twos \n260 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nand threes attached to normal ships. Britain had no dedicated \nsigint ships. By contrast, the Soviets used a flotilla of small spy \nships that looked like trawlers. Meanwhile, the American NSA \nwas developing a fleet of Technical Research Ships, consisting \nof converted supply ships and Second World War Liberty ships \n(vessels that had been hastily produced for convoy duty); it was \nthese latter developments that had caught Cheltenham's eye. \nThe first vessel in NSA's Technical Research Ship programme \nwas the USS Oxford, a converted Liberty ship which put to sea \nin 1961. Its flexibility was immediately apparent as it floated \nfrom one trouble spot to another, admittedly at an ambulatory \npace of just eleven knots. It proved especially successful during \nthe Cuban Missile Crisis. Accordingly, during the 1960s four \nmore ships in the Oxford class were launched: the Georgetown, \nthe Jamestown, the Belmont and the Liberty. Three smaller ships \njoined the listening fleet, based on converted military trans\u00ad\nports: the Valdez, the Muller and finally the Pueblo, which entered \nservice in 1968. However, the American sigint budgets were \ntight in the 1960s, and while all these vessels were refurbished, \nthey had nevertheless seen better days.2 \nIn 1964, partly as a result of advice from the Hampshire \nreview, GCHQ decided that it would go one better, creating a \npurpose-built sigint ship, in contrast to the Americans' elderly \nconverted transports.3 The cover name chosen for this exciting \nnew project was the 'Communications Trials Ship'. The \nPermanent Secretaries Committee on the Intelligence Services \n(PSIS) approved the construction of the first ship on 19 July \n1965. The ambition was to have a fully fitted-out ship by the \nsummer of 1969, allowing time for trials in the autumn before \nit entered service in early 1970.4 There were hopes for two \nfurther ships in the same class.5 In autumn 1965 GCHQ joined \nthe Navy and the Ministry of Transport in sketching out the \ndetails. \nThe sigint ship was to be built to 'extreme naval standard', \nand capable of worldwide operations, 'including the Persian \nGulf'. It needed to be able to cruise at very slow speeds -about \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND Spy PLANES 261 \nfive knots -for long periods, and to have a range of eight thou\u00ad\nsand miles. Substantial size was important, since 'spacing of \nmasts' allowed good direction-finding. The crew was to consist \nof fourteen officers and fifty-three men. These would be outnum\u00ad\nbered by the sigint operators, referred to as the 'Special Trials \nParty'. This would normally consist of seven officers, fifteen \nwarrant officers and seventy Radio Operators. In an emergency, \ntwenty further operators might be accommodated. The Radio \nOperators would work in two large receiving bays, and their \nfacilities would include a trials analysis room, a tape-editing \nroom and a 'SPecial facilities' room. There was also to be a \nstrong room for the most secret materia1.6 All these 'special \nfeatures' were to be housed in a main superstructure unit dubbed \nthe 'black box', which would be prefabricated before delivery \nof the ship.7 \nThe GCHQ personnel driving this project were Russell Dudley\u00ad\nSmith from W Division and Michael Herman from S Division, \nwho was effectively the project officer. There was also strong \nnaval representation.s Staffing was clearly a big issue. It was \nagreed that the crew that sailed the ship would be civilian, but \nthe biggest challenge was the 'Special Trials Party'. There were \nnot enough sigint operators available, and no one wanted to \npay for them. The Navy asserted that it could only find 'a small \nproportion' of the sigint staff without cutting back on its shore\u00ad\nbased listening sites.9 Moreover these personnel were now civil\u00ad\nians.. and there were obvious problems with telling seventy \nlandlubbers that they were suddenly going to sea. \nThe high point of this remarkable project came in March 1966. \nGCHQ's plans had grown to envisage a large experimental nuclear\u00ad\npowered sigint vessel. This was intended to be an existing aircraft \ncarrier refitted with a nuclear power plant. It would afford massive \nspace for intercept staff, and would have almost unlimited range \nfor operations. The Atomic Energy Authority was brought in on \nthe planning, and a design study contract was placed with Harland \n& Wolff of Belfast for 'finalising the proposal in more detail' and \nestimating costs. Because of the sensitive nature of the project, \n262 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nthe cover story sought to disguise it as a 'floating radio trans\u00ad\nmitting station on behalf of the Diplomatic Wireless Service'. 10 \nThis allowed some pre-publicity, and on 5 June 1966 the Sunday \nExpress reported that the ship was designed to allow the Voice of \nBritain to be heard 'loud and clear in the world's most troubled \nareas'. Journalists were closer to the mark when they argued \nthat the ship would fill a 'void created by the surrender of British \noverseas bases'.u \nGCHQ's sigint ship project was still going strong in 1967, and \nthere was a constant stream of new ideas. In their desperate \nefforts to find rlew ways of listening in to the Soviets, American \nscientists had come np with a bizarre project called 'Moon\u00ad\nbounce'. This exploited the possibility of picking up faint echoes \nof Soviet communications that were inadvertently reflected back \ntowards earth from the moon. The special technical equipment \non the sigint ship would be ideal for Moon-bounce, and was to \nwork in tandem with an American satellite installation at RAF \nOakhanger. The Americans had hoped to build this in Turkey, \nbut the government in Ankara had been troublesome and the \nplan fell through. The British had then rushed forward, \nexplaining that a site could quickly be made available at \nOakhanger. With the Americans meeting the capital costs, this \nwas considered 'a good bargain'. 12 \nMoon-bounce was a vast programme for the Americans, who \nhad already begun what was innocuously called the 'Naval Radio \nResearch Station Program' at Sugar Grove in West Virginia. Six \nyears of studies had revealed that the moon reflected all kinds \nof radio energy from central Siberia with 'minimum distortion'. \nThis was hailed as facilitating a radically new approach to intel\u00ad\nligence-gathering that would provide 'unique daily intercept' \nfrom Soviet radars, communications nets and other electronic \nemitting devices. The Sugar Grove facility would work as a \ngenuine scientific research station for radio astronomy when \nthe moon was out of view, but as a massive sigint collection \nstation when it was accessible. However, by the late 1960s satel\u00ad\nlites were proving to be a better way of collecting these signals, \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND SPY PLANES 263 \nand were making Moon-bounce redundant.13 Moreover, back \nin Britain there were growing arguments over money, with \nGCHQ and the Navy attempting to offload most of the cost of \nthe sigint ship on each other. 14 Both GCHQ and NSA were \nencountering serious financial problems, and were having to \nchoose between projects.15 \nThe final death knell for Britain's sigint supership was sounded \nelsewhere. On 8 June 1967, one of NSA's larger sigint ships, \nthe USS Liberty, was tracking developments during the Six-Day \nWar between Israel and Egypt in the Sinai Desert. The Liberty \nwas busy intercepting both Egyptian and Israeli traffic while \nanchored twelve miles off the Sinai coast near El Arish. One of \nits tasks was to try to pick up any evidence of Soviet advisers \nassisting the Egyptians. Planners were aware that the ship was \nin a dangerous spot, and ordered the commander to move \nfurther away from the coast, but these instructions were not \nreceived. During the afternoon the Israelis, who had been \nkeeping the ship under aerial surveillance for several hours, \nlaunched a ferocious attack by air and sea. The first was \nconducted by Mirage jet fighters, and the second by torpedo \nboats. By the time the torpedo boats attacked, the Liberty's crew \nhad hoisted an enormous flag that measured no less than seven \nfeet by thirteen, declaring her to be an American ship.16 \nThirty-four of the Liberty's crew died and 170 were wounded. \nThe ship, with eight hundred holes from prolonged rocket and \ncannon fire, managed to limp away to Malta. In July 1967, the \nPresident's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, with full access \nto sigint intercepts of Israeli radio traffic, concluded that although \nIsraeli aircraft had correctly identified the Liberty as an American \nship, the subsequent attack was the result of incompetence and \nmiscommunication.17 However, James Bamford, whose sigint \nhistory was written with the cooperation of NSA, asserts that \nthe attack was deliberate, and that the Liberty was prominently \ndisplaying the American flag. He claims that the reason for the \nattack was that the Israelis feared that the Liberty had been \neavesdropping on a massacre of Egyptian prisoners of war. \n264 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nLieutenant General Marshall Carter, the Director of NSA, also \ncontinued to insist that it had been a deliberate attack. The issue \nof the Liberty remains a matter of bitter controversy. 18 \nMonths later there was a further disaster. In January 1968 \nthe USS Pueblo, a smaller NSA vesseL was captured by North \nKorea while eavesdropping off its coast, leading to an eleven\u00ad\nmonth stand-off. The crew were poorly trained, and the facil\u00ad\nities to destroy secret equipment and documents if threatened \nwere close to non-existent. Accordingly, the haul of cryptolog\u00ad\nical materials secured by the North Koreans and their Soviet \nadvisers was considerable.19 Some have argued that the real \npurpose of the capture of the Pueblo was acquiring an American \nKL-47 cypher machine. This would have been invaluable, since \nthe KGB had already received the keys to this cypher from one \nof its top agents in the United States, John Walker, an American \nnaval communications expert.20 Sigint ships, which had looked \nso attractive a few years before, were now considered a liability. \nThe Liberty and Pueblo disasters had alarmed Cheltenham; \nhowever, the main problem was overambitious plans colliding \nwith shrinking budgets. In the autumn of 1968, soon after Dick \nWhite was appointed as Cabinet Office Intelligence Coordinator, \nhe was asked to conduct a further inquiry into the alarming \nissue of the spiralling sigint budget. GCHQ's supership was \ncancelled. New sigillI aircraft were now catching the attention \nof planners, while what remained for naval sigint was redirected \ntowards the latest submarines.21 \nHitherto, much of Britain's seaborne sigint effort had consisted \nof a partnership between GCHQ and the Navy's venerable Super\u00ad\nT submarines. In 1960 the intrepid submarine commander John \nCoote had taken HMS Totem on several listening missions around \nthe Soviet Union's Arctic coast, but he confessed that his vessel \nwas now 'well past ... her \"sell-by\" date'.22 Surprisingly, instead \nof being scrapped, both the Totem and the Turpin, two veteran \nspy subs, were purchased by the Israeli Sea Corps, along with \nHMS Truncheon. In 1965 the ageing submarines were refitted, \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND SPY PLANES 265 \nwhile a substantial number of Israeli personnel were trained by \nthe British at HMS Dolphin. The Truncheon and the Turpin then \ntransferred to the main Israeli naval base at Haifa. However, \nwhen the Totem, now renamed the Dakar, Hebrew for \n'Swordfish', prepared to set sail on 9 January 1968, those \nwatching on the quayside were alarmed. The Super-Ts were \ndesigned to take a crew of sixty, but in order to get all the \ntrainees home, she embarked a total of sixty-nine people. Her \nnew modifications included a special 'wet and dry' air lock \nalongside the conning tower for the despatch of special forces \n-which added to her weight.23 Dockers observing her final \npreparations on the quayside were also astonished to see many \ncrates of contraband -mostly whisky -also being loaded, \nfollowed by dismantled motorcycles. Grossly overloaded, she set \nsail around midnight.24 \nA week later the Dakar arrived safely at Gibraltar, then set \nout across the Mediterranean. Her last reported position was \nsomewhere east of Crete on 24 January. Nothing more was \nheard of her. Her wreck was finally discovered in 1999, south\u00ad\nwest of Cyprus, at a depth of over nine thousand feet. She was \nfound by the Nauticus Corporation, the same salvage team that \nlocated the Titanic. Something had caused the submarine to dive \nbelow her maximum pressure depth, and she had suffered a \ncatastrophic implosion of her hull. The Israelis salvaged the \nconning tower, which is now on display at Israel's Naval Museum \nin Haifa. However, few of those passing this striking memorial \nare aware of the secret sigint past of the Dakar and its sister \nships, or of their eventful missions inside the Arctic Circle. \nMeanwhile, in Britain, the baton of special submarine opera\u00ad\ntions passed to the new '0' class submarines, two of which were \nfitted out for sigint activities. For their commanders, the biggest \nanxiety was being forced to the surface by Soviet depth-charging \nor technical failure, and then captured. Alfie Roake, one of \nBritain's most intrepid spy-sub commanders, recalls that the \nquestion they continually asked themselves through the 1970s \n266 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nwas how to avoid becoming another Pueblo.25 In December 1968, \nBritish naval officers explained the division of labour: 'Some \nstrategic Comint gathering is undertaken for GCHQ, but they \ncarry out the tasking and evaluate the results.' The Navy itself \nwas more interested in elint, and helped to run a cell at \nCheltenham which analysed radars that fed into a \nComprehensive Comparative Radar Library. Thereafter, ship\u00ad\nborne analysis computers drew on this library of taped intelli\u00ad\ngence to identify particular Soviet ships.26 In the late 1960s \nattention was shifting to an exciting new task: the tracking of \nthe first Soviet submarines capable of carrying ballistic missiles, \nMoscow's equivalent of Polaris. They first entered service in \n1967, and there were normally four parked off the coast of the \nUnited States at anyone time. \nBritain's submarine operations were increasingly carried out \nin cooperation with her Commonwealth allies, who queued up \nto buy the new 'a' class submarine, and enjoyed the thrill of \nreplicating her special missions. Australia acquired its first 'a' \nboats in 1967, and senior British officers and technicians trans\u00ad\nferred to the Royal Australian Navy with them. The Australian \nsigint target was the burgeoning Soviet naval power in the \nPacific. The 'mystery boats' were always crowded, carrying their \nstandard crew of sixty-two together with up to a dozen civilian \nsigint specialists. Australia'S specialism was the 'underwater \nlook', a perilous manoeuvre that permitted very close recon\u00ad\nnaissance of the propellers, propulsion sounds, sonar fit and \nelectronic signature of the enemy ship. Admiral Peter Clarke, \nwho served first in the Royal Navy and then in the Royal \nAustralian Navy, recalls that the ideal position was just outside \na harbour, where ships slowed to five knots. The submarine \nwould close on its quarry at depth, and then gradually rise just \nahead of the ship. Skilled captains would position their periscope \nabout six feet below the vessel. Special lights and cameras would \nthen scan the underside, while hydrophones and receivers \nrecorded its emissions. A good captain might make two passes. \n'But it was a very full-on thing,' adds Clarke. 'You were driving \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND SPY PLANES 267 \nseveral thousand tons of submarine to within feet of a vessel \nthat you could not see.'27 \nIn the 1970s the ships and submarines working for GCHQ were \noutshone by a new British sigint aircraft called the Nimrod R1. \nThis state-of-the-art spy plane was the prestige intelligence \nproject of the decade, entering service in 1974. Although GCHQ \ncould not afford to join the Americans in the expensive game \nof satellite collection, a fleet of dedicated sigint aircraft was \nsomething no other European country had. Rather like nuclear \nweapons, it was something that marked Britain out as special,28 \nThe main advantage of airborne sigint was that it allowed detec\u00ad\ntion of signals at great range, often from within the airspace of \na neighbouring friendly country. This in turn meant that a great \nvolume of signals could be collected. Aircraft could also collect \nin areas where the creation of ground sites was not possible, \nand could move around rapidly to catch targets of opportunity, \ntypically a major military exercise. The downside was the huge \ndensity of signals that were being received by a small number \nof personnel in one aircraft, who often found themselves over\u00ad\nwhelmed by the volume.29 \nDiscreet discussions on replacement of the existing Comet \nsigint aircraft had begun more than a decade earlier, perhaps \nas early as 1961.30 A highly secretive group called the Technical \nCommittee of London Signals Intelligence Committee, headed \nby Ken Perrin, began work on the future direction of elint \nresearch in November 1961.31 Perrin's group had been a key \ncentre for the development of Peter Wright's 'Airborne Rafter' \nprogramme that had hunted for KGB spies using a special \naircraft. They knew NSA was devoting huge effort to strategic \neli nt, so GCHQ decided to stay away from this area, 'with the \nexception of special purpose equipment in quiet bands'. GCHQ's \nplan was to focus upon niche areas, such as tactical collection \nalong the border with the Eastern Bloc.32 Plessey was awarded \na development contract for what was called 'an experimental \nsideways-looking elint system' in 1962, which was effectively \n268 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nthe l:leginning of the Nimrod Rl programme.33 This new equip\u00ad\nment revealed the ever-increasing complexity of sigint. The \nexisting Comet aircraft depended on teams of human operators \nwearing headphones who undertook the reception and analysis \nmanually, using narrow-band receivers. However, the growing \ndensity and complexity of electronic signals meant that they \nwere simply being overwhelmed. It was 'impossible for the \noperator to sort out and examine all the active transmissions' \nin the limited time that an aircraft spent over the search area. \nThis meant that the most interesting materiaL the unusual \nsignals that might mean new enemy equipment, was being lost. \nPlessey's new system was designed to do much of the work of \nthe operator, and store what it detected for leisurely analysis \nafter the aircraft had returned from its mission.34 \nThe key decisions on the Nimrod were taken in March 1964 \nby the London Signals Intelligence Committee, which oversaw \nall of British sigint. It agreed that although the cost of replacing \nthe Comets 'represents a significant proportion of the UK expen\u00ad\nditure on Sigint', it was nevertheless essential. It was not just \nthat some signals were otherwise inaccessible, but also that prob\u00ad\nlems over bases meant a continual reduction in ground stations \nin areas such as Africa, causing GCHQ 'the greatest difficulty'. \nThe committee noted that stations in Iran and Turkey, which \nwere the source of much intelligence on new Soviet radars, \n'could be denied to us' at any time, adding 'this had already \nnearly happened in Turkey'. It then compared the costs of \npossible aircraft, including the Boeing 707, but the Nimrod Rl, \nwhich was a specialist variant of the RAP's maritime patrol \naircraft, was by far the cheapest.35 \nThe Nimrod had strong backing from the Chiefs of Stafp6 It \nbolstered the much-prized special Anglo-American intelligence \nrelationship by making a bigger contribution to shared sigint.37 As \nAir Vice Marshal Harold Maguire, the Deputy Chief of Defence \nStaff for Intelligence, explained, there was a limited choice of part\u00ad\nners to share burdens with, for although the French ran airborne \nelint missions, there was no exchange with them. Other NATO \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND SPY PLANES 269 \npartners, such as Norway and Turkey, offered full cooperation, \nbut mostly used ground-based stations, and 'in no case do they \nreceive the full benefits of US resources as we do'. Britain had \nbilateral elint agreements with other European countries, such as \nSweden, offering some of the benefits of airborne elint in exchange \nfor 'basic useful data collected by their ground stations in their \nown areas'. 38 The Germans had begun to acquire an airborne \ncapability, and were heavily advised by the British, but their aircraft \nwere small.39 Overall, there was a clear hierarchy. The British were \nsubordinate to the Americans, but enjoyed special status as a \nsophisticated collector. The Anglo-American partnership in Europe \nwas especially close because of 'common tasking through joint \nmonthly meetings', which allowed the British to focus on searching \nfor new signals or low-level air defence analysis.4o \nBritain was the only NATO country receiving raw American \nsigint. Accordingly, Maguire explained, it was the only country \nwith the capability to make its 'own assessments in our area of \ninterest and, where necessary, challenge US assessments'. This \nhad been 'critical' when discussions on future NATO weapon\u00ad\nsystem requiremeIlts had occurred. He added: 'We know that \nour relatively small airborne ELINT programme is appreciated \nby the Americans as a sharing of the collection task, particu-\n1arly as their resources are stretched because of worldwide \ncommitments.' Because of the American need to focus on \nVietnam in the late 1960s, the RAF was 'covering areas that \nthey leave entirely to us'. Some argued that Washington had \ncome to expect the British to do much of the airborne sigint in \nEurope, 'and a failure would threaten the massive help they \ngive us in the whole Sigint area' .41 All this reflected bad rela\u00ad\ntions between NSA and the US Air Force during the Vietnam \nWar, which resulted in a lot of duplication of effort and a drain \non American resources.42 \nNo one questioned the Nimrod rationale, but hiding the costs \nalmost amounted to a secret operation in its own rightY The \ntotal cost of \u00a314 million could not be accommodated within the \nalready tight sigint budget. On 26 July 1967, Burke Trend \n270 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nconcluded that it was unacceptable for the Nimrods to gobble \nup all the available funds in that budget; but since they were \nan essential purchase they were declared to be an integral part \nof Britain's nuclear strategic weapons programme, as their \nintelligence supported targeting. Hence the cost of the Nimrods \nwas not only kept out of GCHQ's budget, it was even kept out \nof the larger and more elusive overall 'Cost of Sigint' spending. \nInstead it became part of what the RAF called 'our overall contri\u00ad\nbution to the hidden SIGINT costings'.44 This meant that all of \nthe RAP's signals activity was swallowed by the more prestigious \nRAF Strike Command to tie sigint in with nuclear weapons.45 \nAs a result, GCHQ began to give more focus to the Nimrods' \nwartime role.46 One of their tasks in a future war would be to \ncompensate for the loss of the sigint units in Berlin, which \ncommanders expected to be sabotaged by the KGB on the eve \nof war and then' quickly overrun by Soviet forces' Y The Nimrods \nalso helped Britain to have a say in nuclear war planning for \nEurope, which was mostly conducted on an Anglo-American \nbasis.48 Increasing emphasis on wartime use was reflected in the \nnew ground facilities at RAF Wyton, which included rapid \ncomint transcription facilities and a full analysis-assessment cell. \nThe idea was that 'hot intelligence reports' could be sent quickly \nto field commanders, while deeper analysis would proceed at a \nmore leisurely pace in GCHQ.49 In its comint role, planners \nexpected to be able to cram seventeen voice operators and four \nsupervisors inside the Nimrod.50 \nIn October 1968, GCHQ's Director of Plans, Ken Perrin, and \nthe RAF sigint managers embarked on a prolonged visit to \nGermany to grapple with the issue of support for forward \ncommanders. GCHQ was still agonising over the release of sigint \nto NATO allies 'in the period of extreme tension leading to \nwar'.51 It also had to decide on the time spent training for \nwartime tactical sigint, set against what Perrin called 'strategic \nsupplementary tasks', in other words the Nimrods' contribution \nto GCHQ's work in peacetime. 52 \n* * * \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND SPY PLANES 271 \nBritain's peacetime sigint targets were increasingly to be found \nin the Middle East. Egypt and Syria had received growing atten\u00ad\ntion since the Six-Day War in 1967, and activities were coor\u00ad\ndinated with the Americans, who were also running 'high-level \ncovert flights' against Syria at the rate of six a month. 53 In 1969 \nthe British were flying some sixty sigint flights a year from RAF \nSharjah in Oman into Iran and out over the Caspian Sea, which \nwas a superb area for collecting intelligence, since its shores \nwere dotted with defence testing facilities.54 In 1970 the Shah \nof Iran personally offered the use of an airfield inside the country \nas a staging post, and these 'valuable facilities' greatly extended \nthe duration of the RAF sigint operations and what they could \nachieve.55 \nThe American experience in Vietnam influenced Britain's \nefforts to improve sigint support to commanders in Europe. In \nApril 1972 the RAP's Vice Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal \nSir Denis Smallwood, met his opposite number, General John \nC. Meyer, together with their senior officers, for a day of affable \ndiscussions, mostly about Vietnam. One of the subjects covered \nwas their 'difference in sigint philosophy'. The British explained \nthat once the Nimrod Rl came on stream, the plan was to feed \nselected information directly into the NATO intelligence network. \nIn a European war, the Nimrod would fly about fifty miles back \nfrom the forward edge of the battle area, out of range of Soviet \nmissiles, providing intelligence direct to operational commanders \nthrough a secure link. The RAF wanted to put experienced \nground operators into the Nimrods, experts on the Soviet order \nof battle who would talk direct to operational formations. By \ncontrast, the Americans explained that in Vietnam, the sigint \ntake from their vast EC-135 aircraft was 'fed back to NSA at \nFort Meade near Washington and processed by computer suffi\u00ad\nciently rapidly for tactical information to be fed back for effec\u00ad\ntive USAF tactical reaction'. The British thought this hopelessly \ncumbersome -and some Americans were inclined to agree.56 \nSigint relations between NSA and the American armed ser\u00ad\nvices in Vietnam had been a disaster. The American system \n272 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nsuffered from the same handicaps witnessed within NATO \ncommands in Germa:i1Y, with a refusal 'to clear field commanders \nfor the information they so badly needed'. Under Marshall \nCarter, NSA Director during the late 1960s, a fierce battle devel\u00ad\noped with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff that 'poisoned the atmos\u00ad\nphere', and relations with the military were at 'an all-time low'.57 \nJohn Meyer, who was about to take over at Strategic Air \nCommand, confided that control of sigint in Vietnam was badly \nsplit between the communicators, the intelligence people and \nthe operators. The RAF noted privately that NSA was 'an organ\u00ad\nisation that does not rate highly with General Meyer'. So far \nno B-52 bombers had been lost, but there was a concern that \n'the Russians were learning a lot from the current operations'. \nBy 1972 British sigint personnel were actually in Vietnam \nobserving the performance of a new tactical sigint aircraft called \nGuardrail 2 which was on a test run by NSA.58 \nIn early 1974, Britain's shiny new Nimrod Rls were about \nto begin their operations on the Soviet periphery. Although their \nactivities were always referred to as 'special', in some ways their \nmissions were rontine, at least in the sense that the aircraft \noften followed a regular pattern. However, on 1 March 1974 \nthese flights were suspended due to the impending British \ngeneral election. David Omand, an official in the Ministry of \nDefence with a GCHQ background, explained that for some time \npast it had been the practice to suspend special intelligence oper\u00ad\nations at such times, partly to avoid any embarrassing interna\u00ad\ntional incidents during the run-up to an election. It was also \nintended to avoid 'saddling new Ministers who take office after \nthe election (whatever their Party) with the possibility of having \nto defend activities of which they may not have had an oppor\u00ad\ntunity to hear about and endorse'. As a result, RAF sigint flights \nfrom Britain and bases abroad were halted, together with \nAmerican reconnaissance flights from Britain and special intel\u00ad\nligence operations by submarines. Lesser activities such as the \noverflying of ships of intelligence interest were reduced to 'a \nlow key'. All this underlines the emergence of a sophisticated \nSTAYING AHEAD -SIGINT SHIPS AND Spy PLANES 273 \nBritish approach to clearing intelligence operations by the early \n1970s.59 \nIn February 1974, the last operational month before the elec\u00ad\ntion, the Americans planned seventeen sigint flights from bases \nin the UK. Most of them were over the Baltic Sea and West \nGermany, and were by RC-135 'Looking Glass' aircraft, a vast \nsigint version of the Boeing 707, flying out of RAF Mildenhall \nin Suffolk. Because these flights were routine they did not \nnormally require approval by the Prime Minister. Instead they \nwere approved by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office forty\u00ad\neight hours ahead of take-off.60 The British were planning similar \nflights: 'Operation Pat', a series of twelve Comet sorties over \nthe Baltic and the Polish coast, and 'Operation Tibet', seven \nComet flights over the same area, all mounted from RAP Wyton. \nIn the Mediterranean, eight Comet sorties were planned under \n'Operation Damage', using RAP Akrotiri. Permission was also \nsought for five flights against targets along the Egyptian and \nSyrian coast, code-named 'Operation Dolven'. However, in \nMarch and April, with the impending election, no activity took \nplace. These flight~ were the last operations by the venerable \nComets, since from May 1974 the RAF began to deploy its newly \nequipped Nimrod R1s.6! \nLike so much of GCHQ's activity, the whole Nimrod \nprogramme was premised on the eternal verities of UKUSA and \nthe Anglo-American special intelligence relationship. It was also \ncarefully calculated to reinforce the distinction in the American \nmind between Britain as a trusted second party and the \nContinental Europeans, an altogether lower species of sigint \nanimal. In the late 1960s GCHQ appeared to be building on \nsolid ground. On both sides of the Atlantic most of the senior \nsigint policy-makers, like Clive Loehnis, Joe Hooper and Joseph \nWenger, had served in the Second World War, and had been \npresent during the foundation of the UKUSA alliance. Although \nMarshall Carter, Director of NSA in the late 1960s, was new to \nthe world of sigint, he was particularly anglophile. When Carter \nretired in July 1969, Joe Hooper wrote him an effusive letter \n274 SPACE, SPY SHIPS AND SCANDALS \nof farewell, thanking him for his personal contribution to the \nNSA-GCHQ relationship and praising his 'instinctive feeling for \nits nature and depth'. However, over the next two decades things \nwould change. In the White House, Westminster and Whitehall \na new generation of political leaders and policy-makers was \nemerging that did not take these things for granted -and there \nwas trouble ahead.62 \nTHE 19705 \nTURBULENCE AND \nTERROR \n15 \nTrouble with Henry \nKissinger then said out of the blue ... that the Special Relationship \nwas collapsing. \nRowley Cromer, British Ambassador to Washington, \n24 November 19731 \nThe late 1960s and early 1970s were dominated by the cata\u00ad\nstrophic war in Vietnam. Harold Wilson was feted by the British \npublic for keeping the country out of the quicksand of this \nprolonged struggle in South-East Asia. What they did not know \nwas that Britain was secretly supporting the conflict by all means \nshort of direct military intervention, and this included 'in \ncountry' operatioI!s by SIS and special forces. GCHQ made a \nsignificant contribution from its sigint sites in Asia, especially \nHong Kong, even though North Vietnamese cyphers were noto\u00ad\nriously secure. The gruelling war stretched American intelli\u00ad\ngence resources to breaking point, rendering assistance from \nGCHQ all the more valuable. \nAlongside Vietnam, there was the challenge of an improving \nrelationship between the West and China. The early 1970s also \nwitnessed a dramatic upsurge in Middle East terrorism, with \nYasser Arafat and the PLO becoming a major sigint target. In \nOctober 1973 the Yom Kippur War suddenly erupted when \nEgypt and Syria launched a surprise attack on Israel. This was \nfollowed in short order by the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. \nDuring these dramatic events sigint proved to be the main source \nof information for world leaders, often constituting two thirds \nof the intelligence which reached their desks. As a result the \nsigint bases came to be regarded as so valuable that in some \n278 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \ncases their protection steered foreign policy. At remote locations \nsuch as the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean or Ascension \nIsland in the Atlantic, the future of entire territories was shaped \nby the need for Anglo-American listening stations. Intelligence \nhad once merely served the 'special relationship', but now secre\u00ad\ntive intelligence and defence projects lay at its very centre.2 \nAlthough GCHQ and NSA worked ever more closely in the \n1970s, there was also serious political turbulence. In 1969, \nRichard Nixon arrived in the White House. Nixon was an \nimpressive foreign-policy President, but he was also an arch\u00ad\nconspirator. Not only did he launch plots and conspiracies, \nincluding Watergate, against others, he also saw them all around \nhim. He distrusted his own intelligence services, and indeed \nmost branches of government. One official assessment suggests \nthat 'During Nixon's years in office, the relationship between \nthe President and the CIA reached the lowest point in the \nAgency's history.'3 Nixon's obsessive secrecy and paranoia were \nonly exceeded by those of his National Security Adviser, Henry \nKissinger, who was as brilliant as he was temperamental. \nTogether they mop-opolised American foreign policy, kept impor\u00ad\ntant secrets from their own intelligence services and tested the \npatience of their British allies.4 \nJames Cable, a senior British diplomat and self-appointed \n'Kissinger expert', remarked that in conceding unique influence \nover foreign affairs to Kissinger, Nixon had 'invested a philoso\u00ad\npher with powers greater than those wielded by most of the \nPrinces of this world'. Kissinger had taught strategy at Harvard \nfor many years, and now had his hands on the real levers of \npower. Seldom has a theorist of international affairs, Cable \ncontinued, been given such opportunities to practise what he \npreached. The problem for the British was that Kissinger's philos\u00ad\nophy was deeply realist, and was focused on the manipulative \nuse of power.5 Worse still, as Cable noted, Kissinger was noto\u00ad\nrious for his 'fits of petulance', and 'could behave badly on occa\u00ad\nsion'.6 \nIn November 1970 there was a new incumbent in Downing \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 279 \nStreet, in the shape of Edward Heath. Britain's new Prime \nMinister was not convinced of the value of the special rela\u00ad\ntionship. He tended to question the continual flow of American \nrequests for new base rights on British territory, and was more \ninclined to seek friends in Europe. Over time, personal diffi\u00ad\nculties between Nixon, Kissinger and Heath led to serious prob\u00ad\nlems in intelligence cooperation. These were only addressed in \nMarch 1974, when Heath departed, following an infamous \nwinter of trade union unrest in Britain. Richard Nixon resigned \na few months later as a result of Watergate; however, Kissinger \nstayed on to serve the new Gerald Ford administration as \nSecretary of State until 1977. \nDespite the potent mixture of personalities, the Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican relationship under Nixon and Kissinger began well. \nOne of Kissinger's many peculiarities was that he often trusted \nsenior British officials with confidences that he would not \nextend to the US State Department. From the outset, the Nixon \npresidency was dominated by efforts to resolve the Vietnam \nconflict. On 20 July 1970, Kissinger met the outgoing British \nAmbassador, John Freeman, to consider a sigint report about \nNikolay Firyubin, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister, who \nhad been overheard discussing the possibility of a major summit \non Vietnam. Kissinger was sceptical, but the sigint report had \nclearly intrigued him, since the Soviets were now Hanoi's prin\u00ad\ncipal backers. The source was 'intercepts from internal commu\u00ad\nnications' secured during Firyubin's recent visit to Delhi, and \nthey seemed to show that the Soviets were keen on 'a nego\u00ad\ntiated end to the war in the not very distant future'. Kissinger \nextended further confidences to the British: \n* Firyubin ... had told the Indians that there had been two \noccasions when Washington and Hanoi had been very near \nagreement and had failed to achieve it mainly because of \nthe deep distrust on either side. Kissinger said that this was \nin fact true, although the information was only known in \na very restricted circle in the White House. This piece of \n280 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \ninformation, which had probably not been passed to us \nover intelligence channels, was of peculiar delicacy.7 \n* Although Kissinger felt the 'intercept was insufficient evidence \nto form a judgement on Soviet intention', he was clearly excited. \nAt the same time, his powerful realist instincts pushed him \ntowards the view that greater military pressure on Hanoi over \nthe coming months would make the North Vietnamese more \nresponsive at the negotiating table.s \nKissinger's conflicting thoughts about the Firyubin intercept \nunderlined the limitations of Western sigint in the early 1970s. \nSigint -and indeed imagery -was delivering fabulous infor\u00ad\nmation on Soviet technical and military activity. Supplemented \nby widespread bugging, it also offered superb insights into diplo\u00ad\nmatic exchanges at conferences outside Russia, when diplomats \nwere vulnerable to short-range interception. The British had, \nfor example, achieved excellent coverage of Alexei Kosygin, the \nSoviet Premier, during his recent stay at Claridge's Hotel in \nLondon.9 Sigint was especially valuable against the leadership \nof North Vietnam, and offered useful insights into negotiations \nwith Hanoi during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Yet the inner\u00ad\nmost thoughts of the Moscow leadership remained elusive. More \nthan two decades after Black Friday, Soviet high-level diplo\u00ad\nmatic communications remained largely unreadable. \nIndiscretions by Soviet diplomats like Nikolay Firyubin on their \ntravels offered only a fleeting glimpse of the thinking of the \nPolitburo.1O \nSome joint Anglo-American intelligence operations were \nattempting to lift the corner of this veil of secrecy. There had \nbeen considerable success in intercepting Soviet government \ntelephone calls, which were carried by microwave relay systems. \nMuch of this material was acquired at short range by technical \nteams in the British and American Embassies in Moscow. The \nBritish operation was code-named 'Tryst', and the American \nwas 'Broadside'. In 1972 the Canadians joined them with their \nown sigint operation, 'Stephanie'. However, American journal-\nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 281 \nists had blown these embassy-based sigint operations, first in \n1966 and then morc spectacularly in a long press article in \n1971.11 Afterwards, the Soviets tried to counter such activities \nby bombarding foreign embassies with microwaves, believing \nthat this disrupted the collection operations. John Nix, who \nserved in the American Embassy in the 1970s, recalls the 'great \npsychological pressure' that American diplomats lived under in \nMoscow as the result of KGB activities. The repeated bugging \nincidents had made people jumpy, but the microwaves made \nthings far worse, because the fact that radiation was being \ndirected at the Embassy 'led to galloping paranoia among \neveryone'. Nix adds that the health concerns appeared genuine, \nsince the Embassy staff suffered 'a large number of deaths from \ncancer', and he recalls three occurrences of the wives of Embassy \nstaff giving birth to children with severe defects; these incidents \ncaused a 'climate of near hysteria', which was made worse by \nthe State Department trying to keep the whole matter secret \nfrom its employees for as long as it could. Morale amongst \nForeign Service officers in Moscow was 'just terrible ... the \nworst I've ever seen'. 12 \nThe arrival of Nixon and Kissinger in the White House marked \na revolution in America's practice of foreign affairs. There had \nalso been important changes in Britain, which while not quite \nso visible at the outset, were also unprecedented. With the \nadvent of Edward Heath as Prime Minister, a new generation \nof officials, especially within the Foreign Office, had begun to \nquestion the relative value of the Anglo-American relationship, \nset against Britain's new commitments to the European \nEconomic Community which it had finally joined in late 1972.13 \nIndeed, the sanctity of the AnglO-American intelligence and \ndefence relationship was being questioned at the very highest \nlevels. Shortly after Heath arrived in office, the Americans had \nasked for further military bases on British territory. He responded \nwith an uncharacteristically broad question. What, he asked, do \n'we get from the Americans in return for the various facilities \n282 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nfor which they ask us?' The unhappy recipients of this ques\u00ad\ntion were Alec Douglas-Home, the Foreign Secretary, and Lord \nCarrington, the Defence Secretary. They were uncomfortable \nfor two reasons. First, the question touched on almost every \naspect of British intelligence and defence planning. Drawing up \nan effective summary kept several luckless defence officials busy \nfor two solid weeks. Second, it revealed Heath's temperamental \ndislike of the special relationship. \nCarrington explained that the Anglo-American partnership \nwas perhaps a natural one, given that the two allies' 'geography \nand size are so different'. Although the scope and scale of \nBritain's residual empire was continually declining, the small \nremnants were nonetheless supremely valuable. Carrington \ncontinued: \n* Because of the number of our remaining island depend-\nencies, we are able to provide the Americans with facili\u00ad\nties which they would get from no one else on a comparable \nscale. Indeed, the very fact of our possession of these \ndependencies enables us to make a considerable contribu\u00ad\ntion to an alliance which is important to both of us but in \nwhich otherwise our respective contributions might be very \nill-balanced. \n* All this allowed Britain to benefit from what he called 'the \nmassive American military technological and intelligence \nmachine'.14 Carrington argued that the hidden reciprocal bene\u00ad\nfits to Britain were in three areas: nuclear weapons, research \nand development, and intelligence. While these things were \nrelatively invisible compared to the requested British real estate, \nthey were nonetheless extremely valuable. Without American \nintelligence, he argued, 'and particularly that derived from the \nNSA/GCHQ Agreement', Whitehall would be unable to assess \nthe key military developments inside the Eastern Bloc and China, \nand indeed would struggle even to produce good intelligence \non lesser threats in the Middle East. However, the relationship \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 283 \nwas more than just a crude exchange of intelligence for facili\u00ad\nties. Carrington argued that Britain was the only other country \nthinking on a global basis with whom the Americans could have \n'a meaningful exchange on matters of common interest from a \nbasis of common intelligence'. Meanwhile, defence officials \ncautioned Heath that the loss of US intelligence 'would reduce \nus to the same position as other European members of NATO'. \nOminously, they also warned that the 'present satisfactory rela\u00ad\ntionship with the USA cannot be taken for granted. It has \nsuffered setbacks in the past.'15 \nIn 1971, London was also keeping secrets from the White \nHouse. A member of the Soviet trade mission in London, the \nthirty-four-year-old Oleg Lyalin, had been recruited as an agent \nby MIS in the spring of 1971, and had then defected to Britain. \nIn reality, Lyalin had been an officer in the sabotage section of \nthe KGB. While serving in London he had been involved in \ndeveloping the most unpleasant operations, including assassi\u00ad\nnations, that were to be initiated against British government \nofficials on the eve of any future conflict with the West. 16 \nWhitehall was shot:ked by what he had to tell, and concluded \nthat this could not be tolerated. Lyalin also revealed the sheer \nnumbers of KGB officers in London, and the relative freedom \nwith which they operated. In September 1971, after some debate, \nthe British government launched 'Operation Foot', in which \nclose to a hundred Soviet diplomats and officials were declared \npersona non grata and expelled.17 London was aware that the \nAmericans might resist this action for fear that it would upset \ndetente, so the British chose not to tell them. Although the \ndecision to expel the KGB officers was taken in principle in late \nMay 1971, Nixon and Kissinger were only informed four months \nlater, after the fact. The excuse offered by London was trans\u00ad\nparently lame. On 24 September 1971 Kissinger wrote to Nixon: \n* The British Ambassador has just delivered a letter to me \nadvising of the UK government's action. They will expel \n90 Soviet personnel, mostly from various technical missions \n284 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \n(over 550 Soviet personnel are in the UK). The Ambassador \nasked that I convey to you the Prime Minister's sincere \nregret. He was unable to advise you in advance as planned. \nA press leak broke the story and required the government \nto move immediately this morning. IS \n* Kissinger sensed that he had been deliberately kept in the dark, \nand was furious.19 The following week, Denis Greenhill, the \nsenior official at the Foreign Office, also pondered whether \nAmerican sigint flights from bases in Britain should be suspended \nuntil they had seen Moscow's reaction to the expulsion of so \nmany KGB officers, fearing that the Soviets might retaliate \nagainst one of these aircraft.20 \nIn Downing Street, discreet resistance to American intelli\u00ad\ngence activities was gathering strength. During December 1971 \nWashington asked for permission to carry out more flights with \nsuper-secret Blackbird SR -71 Mach 3 reconnaissance aircraft \nfrom RAF Mildenhall. Heath took some persuading. However, \nDouglas- Home and Carrington argued that the targets were of \nmutual benefit. The most important was monitoring the Arab\u00ad\nIsraeli ceasefire agreement reached after the Six-Day War of \n1967. The Blackbird SR -71 also offered excellent imagery and \nsigint capabilities against any crises in Europe -typically, possible \nSoviet action against the more independently-minded parts of \nEastern Europe such as Romania and Yugoslavia. Presciently, \nCarrington added that a rejection of the American request might \nstrengthen the hand of those in Washington who believed that \nBritain's entry into the European Economic Community would \n'herald some weakening in Anglo-American collaborative \narrangements generally' .21 \nBritain's Joint Intelligence Committee was acutely conscious \nof the tensions between intelligence cooperation with Europe \nand its long-established close relationship with the Americans. \nNevertheless, in April 1972 a delegation from the JIC headed \nto Paris to meet its French equivalent, the 'Groupe de Synthese \net Prevision'. The French were keen for deep engagement, and \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 285 \nclearly did not regard the visit as 'a mere formality'. The British \nwere also enthused, and saw it as an opportunity to 'influence \nthe French further towards the JIC type organisation'.22 At the \nsame time the British recognised that this raised 'an obvious \nconflict of interest' between their obligation to routinely share \nassessments with Washington and the need to 'protect politi\u00ad\ncally sensitive assessments, particularly on France'. Already the \nJIC was being cautious and keeping most material about France \nfrom the eyes of the Americans, but British intelligence offic\u00ad\ners feared that holding everything back might be noticed, and \nwould 'increase [American] sensitivities on the effect of the \nUK/USA intelligence alliance of British entry into the EEC' .23 \nWashington would have been even less pleased to learn that \nSIS had raised the possibility of exchanging information on \nChina with the KGB. Senior British officials noted: 'It was not \n... desirable to initiate consultation with intelligence allies on \nthis subject.'24 \nMeanwhile, there were unhappy experiences with major Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican intelligence projects based in Britain. In the late 1960s \nthe.British and Americans had agreed to build a large 'Over the \nHorizon Radar' at Orford Ness on the coast of Suffolk, code\u00ad\nnamed 'Cobra Mist'. This was an intelligence-gathering system \nthat watched aircraft and missile developments inside the Eastern \nBloc, up to two thousand miles away. It also provided a degree \nof early warning of missile launches. A similar system was \nalready being jointly operated successfully and under conditions \nof great secrecy in Cyprus. The Americans agreed to provide \nthe capital costs of Cobra Mist, amounting to \u00a313.3 million, \nwhile the British provided the land and buildings, at a cost of \n\u00a31.3 million. The Americans also paid the lion's share of the \nrunning costS.25 \nEarly trials of Cobra Mist focused on the monitoring of Soviet \nfighter reactions to RAF sigint flights in the Baltic. However, \nthese tests revealed that the programme was not going welp6 \nAs early as June 1971, Joe Hooper at GCHQ told Dick White, \n286 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nthe Intelligence Co-ordinator, of his private worries. Sir Alan \nCottrell, the senior defence scientist, had compiled a damning \nreport, and Hooper thought it contained 'many passages which \nwould be unsuitable for American eyes' Y The whole system \nsuffered from enormous amounts of background noise, and the \nintelligence dividends were thin. Efforts to solve the problems \nmight cost another \u00a320 million, and even then there was no \nguarantee of success. The whole concept of 'Over the Horizon \nRadars' might soon be eclipsed by a new generation of satel\u00ad\nlites that were much better at detecting missile launches.28 In \naddition, the limited intelligence that Cobra Mist was giving on \nSoviet aircraft movements was already available from sigint \nsources.29 \nCobra Mist had also caused trouble in unexpected quarters. \nKeith Joseph, the Secretary of State for Health, was alarmed by \nthe high-power radiation emitted by the radar and its effects \non nearby residents. His officials feared that the latest cardiac \npacemakers might be neutralised by the radar pulses. Improbably, \nJoseph argued that the leads which connected directly to the \nheart muscle 'might pick up sufficient energy from a high \nfrequency high intensity radiation to administer a lethal shock'. \nWhile he admitted that it was unlikely that such patients would \nbe 'found wandering along the foreshore at Orford Ness', he \nnevertheless insisted that some would be 'in grave danger of \ndeath'.3D No sooner had the excitable Joseph been reassured \nthan technicians from the Post Office warned that the nearby \ntown of Aldeburgh might lose all television reception. This rather \nmore plausible prospect seemed to cause officials real anxiety.31 \nOn 18 June 1973 the Americans formally announced that \nthey wanted to pull out of Cobra Mist leaving the British to \nwind up the operation and layoff hundreds of disgruntled staff.32 \nBurke Trend, the Cabinet Secretary, was horrified by the likely \ndrain on Britain's intelligence funds.33 Louis Le Bailly, the highly \ncapable Director General of Intelligence at the Ministry of \nDefence, agreed that they were now faced with considerable \ncosts for a white elephant, including restoring the ecology around \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 287 \nthe Orford Ness site, and 'a considerable public relations \nproblem'.34 MI5 warned that large numbers of the civilian tech\u00ad\nnicians at Orford Ness were union members, and predicted \nstrikes which might well spread to the missile warning station \nat Fylingdales in Yorkshire.35 Michael Herman, a senior GCHQ \nofficer who was serving as Secretary of the JIC, was also \nconcerned by the press discussion of Cobra Mist, because of the \npublic references to 'eavesdropping on Russian communications' \nwhich were rare in 1973.36 In the end the British made the best \nof a bad job and converted Orford Ness into a Foreign Office \ntransmitter site.37 \nMajor failures such as Orford Ness were irritating, but were not \nunusual in the increasingly high-tech world of intelligence. The \nmore serious problems in the Anglo-American intelligence rela\u00ad\ntionship were political in nature. In March 1973 Britain was \nstill enjoying unique access to Henry Kissinger, and had been \nworking closely with him on arms control. Indeed, Kissinger \nhad prevailed upon the British to produce an early draft of a \npossible agreement with the Soviets on conventional arms \ncontrol, or 'Mutual Balanced Force Reductions', while keeping \nhis own State Department firmly out of the loop. For Rowley \nCromer, the British Ambassador, this was a clear sign of 'the \nhighly devious nature of Kissinger's intellectual make-up'. At \nthe same time, Cromer was conscious of a change in Kissinger's \ndemeanour. There was now 'an underlying element of strain \nand perhaps emotion' beneath his outwardly calm exterior, and \nduring their recent meetings Kissinger had verbally attacked \nalmost every country he could think of, whether friend or foe, \nexcept the British and the Chinese. He had launched into lengthy \ntirades about the State Department, the Pentagon, government \neconomists and the Europeans. Cromer found his general scorn \nfor the Europeans 'particularly disturbing', adding, 'I always \nhave an uneasy feeling that we may commit some error which \nwill bring down the Headmaster's censure.' It was, of course, \ngood to enjoy such a close and confidential relationship with \n288 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nKissinger, but Cromer warned, 'It is a dangerous and compli\u00ad\ncated path that we tread:38 \nKissinger's underlying nervousness was caused by the emer\u00ad\ngence of the Watergate scandal, involving Nixon's use of former \nCIA agents to burgle the Democratic National Committee head\u00ad\nquarters in the Watergate building in Washington, and to bug \nhis political opponents there. The story had only just surfaced, \nbut the strain was pronounced by the time Burke Trend and his \nteam travelled to Washington to meet Kissinger again a month \nlater. It was obvious that Watergate was already beginning to \nundermine the Nixon administration's moral authority. Trend \nhad been taking the lead in these conversations with Kissinger, \nand he now warned Edward Heath that on the matter of Europe, \nthe Secretary of State was 'a man in a hurry': 'There was a new \nurgency and impatience in his approach to the problem, which \nresults, I suspect, from his increasing realisation that time is \nbeginning to run against him: Kissinger said little to Trend about \nWatergate, other than to observe that he was 'keeping clear of \nit'. However, everyone could see that he was on edge and his \npatience was fast running out.39 \nThe Headmaster's censure was not long in corning. It arrived \nunexpectedly during late July 1973 at a meeting in Washington \nbetween Kissinger and Trend. Kissinger remonstrated about fail\u00ad\nures to get a swift European response on his proposals for \n'Mutual Balanced Force Reductions'. Trend replied that Kissinger \nwas being unrealistic about the new European institutions, and \nwas 'trying to get the machine to work faster than it was capable \nof'. He had expected the meeting to be tough, and even Kissinger \ncharacterised it as 'a session of recrimination'. The substance of \nKissinger's complaint was that Britain had refused to discuss the \narms control proposals with Washington before talking to the \nEuropeans. He said rather bitterly that the US had 'never treated \nBritain as just another country', and warned that this would \nhave 'major consequences for bilateral relations between the \nUS and the UK'. Several times he stressed that AnglO-American \nrelations would be 'severely affected by recent events'.40 The \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 289 \nCabinet Office was shocked by this outburst, and kept knowl\u00ad\nedge of the exchangE on the 'strictest need-to-know basis'Y \nKissinger was looking for a symbolic area to hit that would \nsend a clear message to London. He chose the intelligence rela\u00ad\ntionship. The next day, intelligence relations between the two \ncountries were halted. NSA went quiet, and officials told Heath \nthat the CIA had 'suspended the supply of certain intelligence \nmaterials to us'. NSA and the CIA had been instructed to cease \nintelligence exchange with GCHQ and SIS. British officials \nregarded this as 'sinister'Y All the American intelligence agen\u00ad\ncies were surprised. but moved cautiously for fear of incurring \nthe wrath of the White House. Bill Bonsall, who had only just \ntaken over from Joe Hooper as Director of GCHQ, immediately \nheaded off to Washington to see what he could find out. On \n16 August Burke Trend was told that the JIC was trying to come \nup with some recommendations, although the problem was \nquite unprecedented: 'All the indications are that the JIC are \nfinding it hard to make up their minds.'43 In fact the JIC discussed \nAnglo-American intelligence relations at four consecutive meet\u00ad\nings during late Avgust and early September as it struggled to \naddress the problem.44 Kissinger's 'cut-off' had the desired effect, \nand sent shock waves through the British establishment. This \nevent is so sensitive that even after more than thirty years have \npassed, the Cabinet Office still refuses to declassify further docu\u00ad\nments on the subject.45 \nThe reactions of the American intelligence agencies to \nKissinger's insistence on a cut-off varied. NSA offered a legal\u00ad\nistic response, insisting that its relationship with GCHQ was \ngoverned by 'a binding international treaty', so it would have \nto investigate and see what could be done. This was a polite \nway of telling Kissinger that it intended to ignore him. The CIA \nalso fudged its reply on the matter of human intelligence or \nreports from agents that were supplied to SIS. Certainly at a \nstation level, some cooperation continued. The area that was \nhit hardest was imagery, the supply of top-secret photographs \nfrom spy planes and satellites. The senior RAF officer tasked \n290 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwith collecting this sensitive imagery, who travelled to \nWashington once a week on an RAF Comet airliner, turned up \nand found that 'The bag just was not there.'46 \nPolitical relations deteriorated further during August and \nSeptember. Although Edward Heath was urged to write to \nNixon on 17 August, it was not until 4 September that offi\u00ad\ncials managed to extract a crawling letter from him.47 Heath \nassured the President that there was 'certainly no question of \nthe relationship between your country and our one becoming \none of adversaries'. At the same time, he could not resist \nlecturing Nixon about the complementary nature of Britain's \nrelationships with Europe and the United States.48 Nixon's \nresponse was notably brief and forma1.49 Crispin Tickell, who \nled a Foreign Office mission to Washington in September 1973, \ndiscovered that many staffers on the US National Security \nCouncil believed that Britain was now 'more European than \nthe Europeans'. They were complaining loudly that 'The British \nare pursuing a consistently anti-American policy on a wide \nvariety of subjects.'5o \nSome British officials argued that in 'the intelligence field' \nthe Americans were cutting off their nose to spite their face, \nsince any suspension of cooperation was 'not ... in their own \nbest interests'.51 Heath was determined to prove the point, and \nopportunities for retaliation were not long in arriving. At midday \non Saturday, 6 October 1973, a coalition of Arab states inflicted \na remarkable surprise attack on Israel that had not been fore\u00ad\nseen by any of the world's major intelligence services. The Yom \nKippur War ranks alongside Pearl Harbor and Hitler's attack on \nRussia in 1941 as one of the most extraordinary surprise attacks \nof all time. Two weeks before, on 25 September, King Hussein \nof Jordan had flown secretly to Israel to warn the Prime Minister, \nGolda Meir, of what was coming. However, Israeli intelligence \ndid not believe that Egypt was capable of launching a surprise \nattack because it lacked air superiority, and so, despite receiving \nnumerous other warnings, they closed their ears. On the \nmorning of 6 October, hours before Egyptian forces pounced, \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 291 \nMeir's Cabinet finally woke up to the fact that the country was \nabout to be attacked. At this point they concluded, probably \nrightly, that Israel would be better off appearing to the world \nas an unambiguous victim, rather than trying to pre-empt the \ninvasion. 52 \n'In the Yom Kippur War we were all wrong -even Mossad: \nrecalled Louis Le Bailly, Britain's Director General of Intelligence \nat the Ministry of Defence. On the Friday morning, two days \nbefore the attack, one of the younger colonels in Britain's \nDefence Intelligence Staff did actually predict the Egyptian moves \nprecisely, but he was overruled by a general who had recently \nvisited the Israeli defences along the Suez Canal, known as the \nBar-Lev Line, and insisted they were impregnable 'on the Israeli \nsay-so'. On the Friday afternoon 'a girl from GCHQ' also got it \nright in a discussion of the Current Intelligence Group on the \nMiddle East, but was similarly shot down by her colleagues. \nThe brilliant Egyptian deception plan, masterminded by the \nSoviets, had only two flaws. First, the Soviets had evacuated \ntheir own families from Damascus to Tripoli by ship on the \npreceding Thursday evening. Second, on the Friday night the \nSoviets launched a new satellite over the region. Both of these \ntell-tale events were missed by Western intelligence.53 Louis Le \nBailly was so convinced that all in the Middle East was quiet \nthat on the Thursday before the Yom Kippur attack he sent his \nown youngest daughter out to spend the summer working on \nan Israeli kibbutz. 54 \nIn terms of collection at least, GCHQ's American partner NSA \ndid rather better. An inquiry led by Congressman Otis Pike later \nconcluded that as early as the last week of September, NSA had \nbeen 'picking up clear signals that Egypt and Syria were \npreparing for a major offensive'. However, this sigint material \nwas voluminous low-grade administrative chatter, and did not \nattract the interest of rarefied intelligence analysts. Meanwhile, \nsome of the high-grade material that revealed the attack only \nreached decision-makers in Washington days after the fact. Pike \nnoted ruefully that costly intercepts from NSA's vast sigint \n292 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nmachine had detected some of the Egyptian preparations for \nwar, but the intercepts achieved 'scant impact' on high-level \nreporting, so the most valuable intelligence had never reached \nthe policy-makers.55 \nTo the intense anger of Washington, the British adopted a \npolicy of strict neutrality towards the war. This extended even \nto intelligence, with London implementing tight restrictions on \nAmerican spy flights from British bases. U-2 spy flights by the \nCIA from Cyprus were banned, and tough limits were placed \non flights from Britain by the larger SR -71 Blackbird recon\u00ad\nnaissance aircraft. Not only did the British impose a very cumber\u00ad\nsome process for ministerial approval for any American spy \nflights during the crisis, they also insisted that the resulting \n'take' must not on any account be given to Israel. The Germans \nwere equally obstructive. American intelligence officers were \nfurious. According to Richard Helms, who had served as Director \nof the CIA up to early 1973, British attitudes caused shock at \nthe CIA's Langley headquarters: 'CIA cancelled all contacts ... \nwhen Heath demanded 2 conditions for US landing rights in \nUK during [the] Middle East Crisis.'56 In the event, Kissinger \nbaulked at these restrictions, and marathon SR-71 operations \nwere flown from Griffiss Air Force Base in New York State, the \nnearest unrestricted operational base. It was not for nothing \nthat this secret programme was code-named 'Giant Reach'.57 \nThe SR-71 was a futuristic aircraft that flew on the edge of \nspace, but its weakness was that it burned eight thousand gallons \nof fuel an hour at top speed. During 'Giant Reach' it would \nneed to be refuelled in the air five times from no fewer than \nsixteen KC-135 tankers, meaning that the chances of something \ngoing wrong were greatly increased. Jim Wilson, one of the \npilots, recalls one of the early flights from Griffiss Air Force \nBase. Somewhere south of Crete, 'I lit the afterburners and \nstarted acceleration toward the target area.' He then got a red \nwarning light telling him that the engine oil quantity was low. \nHe turned the afterburners off and on before pressing forward, \nfearing a 'single engine emergency arrival at Ben Gurian airport \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 293 \nin Tel Aviv'. Returning from the target, he had only fifteen \nminutes' worth of fuel left when he met up with the next \ntanker. On landing, the ground crew had recovered the imagery \nand the sigint from the aircraft within twenty minutes.58 Four \nflights were made from Griffiss before deteriorating weather \nforced the SR-71 teams to move to Seymour Johnson Air Force \nBase in North Carolina, which was even further away.59 \nIt has been alleged that these missions were helpful to the \nIsraelis, who. when handed the material they gathered were \nable to spot weak points in the Egyptian lines, contributing to \ntheir success in the latter stages of the war.60 Kissinger had also \nkept up American resupply to the region, and by 16 October \nthe Israelis were pushing confidently into the Sinai.61 However, \nby 24 October Kissinger was calling for current intelligence on \nthe exact positions of the two sides, whereupon Bill Colby, the \nDirector of the CIA, admitted: 'I don't have any solid informa\u00ad\ntion.' Yet another precarious ultra-long-range SR-71 mission \nwas required. After agonising for some minutes, Kissinger \nexclaimed, 'Let's fly the thing. We've got to find out what's \ngoing on.'62 \nThe most controversial event of the Middle East War occurred \na day later on Thursday, 25 October. Richard Nixon decided to \nput American forces on a nuclear alert, or 'Defcon 3', in an \neffort to send the Soviets a clear signal not to intervene in the \nconflict. Edward Heath was incensed, since he regarded this \nmove as provocative and unnecessary. What was worse, Heath \nwas the last person to find out. Most senior British officials \nknew early on the Friday morning, but Heath only found out \nfrom news sources in the afternoon. A furious Heath ordered \nan inquiry by a former Cabinet Secretary, Sir Edward Bridges: \n'I wish the highest priority to be given to this with no attempt \nwhatever to hide any defects there may have been in our system \nat Home or defects in President Nixon's conduct.' Heath insisted \nthat the 'world wide nuclear alert' had done 'immense harm', \nand complained that 'an American President in the Watergate \nposition [was] apparently willing to go to such lengths at a \n294 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nmoment's notice without consultation with his allies', adding \nthat he worried what this meant for the control of American \nnuclear forces based in Britain.63 On balance, Percy Cradock and \nthe Assessments Staff agreed with Heath that the US nuclear \nalert was an overreaction: \n* US Sigint authorities at 0102 hours GMT on 26 October \nreported that there had been no evidence to suggest the \nSoviet Union's military forces on a worldwide basis had \nassumed an increased state of alert. There were no signif\u00ad\nicant anomalies or deviations from normal communica\u00ad\ntions patterns that would indicate that the Russians had \nplaced their forces on a higher degree of readiness. \nSpecifically, there were no Sigint reflections of a change in \nthe posture of strategic rocket forces or increased alert in \nthe Soviet Navy. \n* Although the Assessments Staff tried to hedge, they had to agree \nwith Heath that the Americans had overreacted. Moreover, \nKissinger had seemingly misled Rowley Cromer, the British \nAmbassador, telling him that America was only moving to 'a \nlow level' of military alert.64 Inexcusably, on the morning of 25 \nOctober everyone in Whitehall had been told about the \nAmerican action except the Prime Minister. News had initially \ncome in by telephone, but was soon confirmed by GCHQ, which \nhad received the information 'in an intelligence context' from \nNSA. No one thought to tell Edward Heath.65 \nKissinger railed against the British arms embargo and the \nrestrictions attached to reconnaissance flights from bases in \nBritain and CypruS.66 The new American Secretary of Defense, \nJames Schlesinger, shared his irritation. Schlesinger had been \nappointed in July 1973, having previously served as a short\u00ad\nlived and intensely unpopular Director of the CIA.67 He vented \nhis feelings during a heated exchange with Lord Carrington \nwhen they met in The Hague on 7 November, making a series \nof allegations. He insisted that London 'had been in close collu-\nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 295 \nsion with the French with the object of frustrating American \npolicy objectives in the Middle East', and accused the British of \nundermining Egyptian support for a ceasefire resolution put \nbefore the United Nations by the Americans. One of Schlesinger's \nstaff at the Department of Defense, almost certainly Harry \nBergold, added privately that 'stories about sinister Anglo/French \ncollusion' had been 'fed' to Schlesinger by other mischievous \nEuropean allies, suggesting that the Dutch were the prime \nsuspects.68 \nEdward Heath was adamant that Britain should also avoid \nspy flight incidents during the Middle East crisis, and ministers \nhurriedly reviewed all airborne sigint activities. Routine moni\u00ad\ntoring flights along the Inner German Border and in the Baltic \nwere considered unproblematic. More worrying was a \nprogramme code-named 'Operation Duster' that involved sigint \nComets flying out of RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus and along the \nEgyptian and Syrian coasts, together with Canberras from Luqa \non Malta which flew along the Libyan coast. About a dozen \nmissions a month were flown. Even more problematic was \n'Operation Hem', a sigint marathon that passed through the \nregion. Flights originated at RAF Wyton and made their way \nto Luqa before taking the opportunity to loiter along the Libyan \ncoast. They refuelled again at Akrotiri and then headed east \nonce more, listening along the Egyptian coastline, finally arriving \nat Tehran. They would then operate for a week out of Tehran \nand Mehrabad in Iran, flying along the borders with Russia and \nIraq before heading back to Britain, revisiting Egypt and Libya \non the way.69 Julian Amery, the Foreign Office Minister, empha\u00ad\nsised that these flights must continue because of the 'very valu\u00ad\nable' intelligence they collected, but over the eastern \nMediterranean greatly increased safety distances were main\u00ad\ntained' 'keeping the aircraft very close to Cyprus' .70 \nThe end of the Heath administration on 4 March 1974 signalled \na gradual improvement in relations with the Americans. When \nKissinger visited London later that month to talk with Harold \n296 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nWilson's second administration, he appeared somewhat chas\u00ad\ntened. Intelligenc~ was again a symbolic issue. The Middle \nEast War was now over, and Kissinger asked for a resump\u00ad\ntion of U-2 flights from RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus for moni\u00ad\ntoring the Arab-Israeli ceasefire. Because the war was over \nthere could now be no question of spy flights favouring the \noperations of one side or the other, so London was amenable \nto these operations starting up again. British officials noted \nthat they wished to avoid a repetition of the acrimonious \nexchanges of October 1973, and were now 'anxious to be as \nhelpful as we can'. Nevertheless, there were worries about \nthe public reputation of the U-2 as a 'spy plane', and the \nBritish thought its distinctive shape would soon be noticed. \nInstead of opting for secrecy, they chose to tell Archbishop \nMakarios, the President of Cyprus, and President Sadat of \nEgypt about the flights, and even made a low-key announce\u00ad\nment in the press. These U-2 intelligence missions were now \nto be overt-covert flights.71 \nBy April 1974 the damage was being repaired. The CIA had \nsent another long-distance SR-71 flight over the disengagement \narea between the Israelis and the Egyptians in the Sinai Desert. \nThis showed that both parties were complying fully with their \nceasefire commitments. The CIA told British liaison officers in \nWashington that in recognition of British helpfulness over \nrestarting the U-2 missions from Cyprus, it was willing to share \nthe results of this flight. It was explained that 'SR -71 s would \nprobably not be used in the vicinity of the area of disengage\u00ad\nment' once U-2s began operating from Cyprus again. Thereafter, \nthe US National Photographic Intelligence Center would provide \nthe British with 'a duplicate positive copy of the film taken from \neach U-2 flight' over the Sinai, together with a complete written \nassessment generated by the CIA for its own purposes.72 \nHowever, the SR -71 flights over Syria continued, and \nremained a problem between the British and the Americans as \nlate as July 1974. Admiral Bill Moffit, who worked with the \nCIA's Office of Special Activities, met British liaison officers in \nTROUBLE WITH HENRY 297 \nWashington, and complained that the State Department was \nstill discouraging requests to Britain for SR -71 flights out of RAF \nMildenhall, believing it to be an area of continued sensitivity \nfor London.73 The British explained the distinctions between spy \nflights during hostilities, which could lead to allegations of parti\u00ad\nsanship, and monitoring in support of a ceasefire. Moffit wanted \npermission for SR -71 flights from Mildenhall to monitor the \nfragile peace in the Middle East. U-2s were fine over the Sinai, \nbut were not favoured for surveillance of the Golan Heights, \nsince they were vulnerable and the Syrians could not be trusted \nnot to fire on them. Although the higher-flying SR-71s were \nout of range of attack from the ground, the Americans did not \nwant to undertake further marathon missions from the United \nStates, and had recently been flying reconnaissance aircraft from \ncarriers in the Bay of Naples. The British were quick to reas\u00ad\nsure Moffit that SR -71 flights from Britain could be resumed, \nadding that 'The last thing we wanted was repetition of the \nOctober War misunderstanding:74 \nIn July 1974 there was a further changing of the guard \nwhen Richard Nixon finally resigned after struggling with the \naftermath of the Watergate break-in for more than a year. \nKissinger was staying on, but the British expected that the \narrival of the Gerald Ford presidency would 'change the whole \nenvironment in which Kissinger at present operates' - a \nprospect that did not disappoint them.75 They still wondered \nwhat had caused Kissinger to take such a hard line on the \nAnglO-American relationship, and to impose the remarkable \nintelligence cut-off during August 1973. Richard Sykes, Rowley \nCromer's perceptive deputy at the British Embassy in \nWashington, asked himself the same question, as many agreed \nthat the Americans' behaviour was not in their own best inter\u00ad\nests. Sykes thought the answer could be summed up in one \nword: 'Watergate'. From late April 1973, he argued, this had \nhung like a black cloud over everything, and if not for that \nabiding psychological pressure, Nixon and Kissinger would \nhave taken a 'more relaxed view' of events on the inter-\n298 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nnational scene. Watergate had combined with Vietnam and \nthe Oil Crisis to create a generally depressing political atmos\u00ad\nphere in Washington. Sykes continued: \n* I am sometimes asked by English visitors why the \nAmericans are in such a difficult and touchy frame of mind \ntoday. In reply, I say that they had to go through the equiv\u00ad\nalent, in our terms, of Suez, the Profumo case and the \ndevaluation of \u00a3, not in a timescale of twelve years as we \ndid, but in not much more than two. It was, therefore, not \naltogether surprising that they were being prickly and diffi\u00ad\ncult.76 \n* \n16 \nDisaster at I(izildere \nTraitors! Pro-American dogs! These English agents were from \nNATO forces occupying our country ... it is our most fundamental \nright and debt of honour to kill these agents by shooting them. \nStatement by the Turkish People's Liberation Army left \nat the village of Kizildere, 30 March 19721 \nThe British intelligence community was not ready for the rise \nof terrorism. Although GCHQ's sigint targets were more diver\u00ad\nsified than those of NSA, it remained terribly anxious to prove \nits value to Washington. This meant that Soviet military activity \nremained a very high priority for Cheltenham. While GCHQ \nand NSA had large-scale collection programmes in the volatile \ncountries of the Middle East and Africa, especially telephone\u00ad\ntapping programmes, these too were tuned to watching either \nthe activities of the Soviets or confrontations between Israel and \nits neighbours. In countries such as Iran, Ethiopia and Turkey, \nthe vast sigint collection programmes of the West were mostly \nlistening to signals from the Soviet Union. Little attention was \nbeing paid to new religious and social movements within these \ncountries. It was for this reason that the West was taken by \nsurprise by the fall of the Shah of Iran in February 1979. Where \nthere was monitoring of local Middle Eastern traffic, its focus \nwas often narrowly on oil and arms sales. David Owen, who \nwas Foreign Secretary at the time of the rise of religious revo\u00ad\nlutionaries in Iran, laments that one of Britain's mistakes was \nto take 'short-term advantage of our Persian linguists to improve \nour commercial performance at the expense of in-depth polit\u00ad\nical reporting'. On reflection, he felt that the right kind of moni\u00ad\ntoring by GCHQ, together with closer cooperation with Mossad, \n300 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwhich knew about the opposition groups in Iran, was what had \nbeen required. 'With our electronic sources ... we could have \nanalysed more and possibly anticipated events.'2 \nTurkey was another country where internal instability and \nviolence impacted on the Western intelligence community \nbecause of the vast sigint presence there -over fifteen thou\u00ad\nsand NATO personnel, most of whom were Americans. In the \nlate 1960s a left-wing movement had opposed growing Western \neconomic and military influence in the country. These groups \nwere broadly based, and counted amongst their numbers many \nstudents, academics, bureaucrats and even military officers. Their \nmilitancy reflected serious social issues, with soaring inflation \nand problems in the agricultural sector. In short, there was \nplenty of combustible material for radical groups to exploit. \nDuring the first months of 1970, left-wing activists became more \nviolent, bombing public buildings and machine-gunning police \nstations. \nFebruary 1970 saw the first sign of serious trouble, when a \ngroup of eleven students was arrested at Diyarbakir, near the \nSyrian border. They had been undergoing secret training with \nthe Palestinians near Damascus, and had been liberally supplied \nwith arms and explosives. This training in Syria contributed to \nthe growth of two different militant groups, the Turkish People's \nLiberation Army (TPLA) and the Turkish People's Liberation \nFront (TPLF). Both consisted of middle-class intellectuals who \nregarded themselves as a revolutionary vanguard. Like many \nrevolutionary leaders, they suffered from a 'Che Guevara \ncomplex', believing that symbolic acts of violence could trigger \na wider social revolution. Che Guevara had come to grief in \n1967 during a futile attempt to stir the revolutionary conscious\u00ad\nness of Bolivia, and was captured and shot by a police team, \nadvised by the CIA. Turkey's would-be revolutionaries would \nsoon suffer a similar fate. However, in the meantime, the attacks \nin Turkey focused on the foreign intelligence presence, including \nsigint collection sites.3 \nNSA and GCHQ should have been more alert. They had \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 301 \nsubstantial numbers of sigint personnel in Turkey because of \nthe proximity of vast Soviet missile-and aircraft-testing sites \naround the Caspian Sea. It was the US Air Force that had led \nthe sigint effort here. Back in January 1953, Colonel Arthur \nCox from the USAF Security Service had arrived to seek out a \nsite for the first American radio squadron, and selected \nKaramursel, a small market town forty miles south of Istanbul. \nThe vast compound of seven hundred acres was shared with \nthe US Naval Security Group. Although other monitoring \nstations were established in Turkey, Karamursel remained the \nlargest, with clOSe to a thousand personnel.4 It gradually passed \nunder the control of the US Naval Security Group, since its \nmain task was listening to the voice and Morse traffic of the \nSoviet Navy exercising in the Black Sea. It also hosted NSA's \nregional communications centre, which relayed sigint from \nnumerous other stations back to NSA headquarters at Fort \nMeade.5 \nAlthough Karamursel monitored Soviet space launches, \nincluding Yuri Gagarin's historic flight in April 1961, it was not \nideally placed to listen to missile tests further east, at places like \nKapustin Yar. Accordingly, further sigint sites blossomed along \nthe coast of the Black Sea, at Sinop and Samsun. These \nspecialised in gathering the signals from new Soviet missiles as \nthey were being tested -known as telemetry -and had special \nintelligence-gathering radars that tracked the missiles in flight.6 \nAt Samsun, only three hundred miles from the Soviet border, \nlisteners could discover when each missile type was perfected \nand passed into production. Other stations along Turkey's \nnorthern coastline listened in to high-frequency communica\u00ad\ntions.7 \nThe intelligence gathered from these stations was a strategic \ntreasure trove: some have suggested that three quarters of the \nWestern intelligence on Soviet strategic weapons systems came \nfrom Turkey, together with smaller stations in neighbouring \nIran. In the late 1960s, vast sums were invested in a new facility \nat Pirinclik Air Base, close to the Syrian border at Diyarbakir. \n302 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nHere the Americans constructed two huge intelligence radar \nsystems, one for detection and the other for tracking. Even more \nsecret were several small intelligence stations on the outskirts \nof the Turkish capital Ankara. Here the USAF base at Belbasi \nhosted a seismic intelligence station that captured the vibrations \nfrom underground atomic explosions at the Soviet weapon\u00ad\ntesting facility at Semipalatinsk. Nearby were other sensitive \nposts eavesdropping on the diplomatic traffic generated by \nAnkara, hidden within America's Military Mission headquar\u00ad\nters and known as 'TUSLOG'. (This stood for US Logistics \nOrganisation ill Turkey, and its inconspicuous name provided \nthe cover for many intelligence activities.) Here the Americans \nsuccessfully bribed a Turkish code clerk to hand over his own \ngovernment's cyphers.8 \nIn short, Turkey was to the American NSA what Cyprus was \nto GCHQ, hosting a vast network of aerial farms, dishes and \nmonitoring stations. There was overlap: just as NSA had some \nsmall bases on Cyprus, GCHQ had some small stations in Turkey. \nAs early as 1952 the two countries had agreed to 'concert Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican operations in the field' with regard to Turkey. EM. \nSmith, the GCHQ officer in charge of the British units in Turkey, \nworked with local US Army Security Agency units to agree on \na suitable division of labour.9 Britain also carried out many of \nits sigint and imagery flights from Cyprus over Turkey or Iran, \nfollowing the border and going out over the Black Sea or the \nCaspian Sea. In the mid-1960s Britain was carrying out more \nthan a thousand overflights a year across Turkey, many of them \nfor intelligence purposes.1O \nThe rising tide of leftist violence and the large foreign intel\u00ad\nligence presence inside Turkey was a volatile combination. In \nthe 1960s the sigint facilities were protected by their extreme \nsecrecy. Although large and visible with their domes and dishes, \nfew knew of their real purpose or importance. Instead, the brunt \nof leftist anger was borne by the CIA, which radicals asserted \nwas exerting a malign influence over the Turkish government, \nand was behind the growing efforts to repress the left. The \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 303 \nAmericans had certainly assisted with the development of MIT, \nthe Turkish intelligence agency, and various groups of special \nforces. In November 1968 Robert Komer, who had previously \nserved in Vietnam with the CIA, arrived as US Ambassador in \nAnkara, provoking much comment. In January 1969 his visit \nto the campus of Ankara's Middle East Technical University, a \nbastion of radicalism, triggered a major riot. I I \nIncreasing numbers of young Turkish officers and govern\u00ad\nment officials joined the radicals, and this translated into an \nunwelcome interest in the more sensitive installations. On 29 \nJanuary 1971 a group of about twenty students attacked \nAmerica's TUSLOG headquarters in Ankara, throwing a bomb \nand a Molotov cocktail, followed by sporadic small-arms fire. \nThe bomb destroyed a vehicle, and Turkish soldiers returned \nfire.12 The next month, an armed group abducted a US Air Force \nsergeant at Balgat, on the outskirts of Ankara. Although he was \nfreed after seventeen hours, the incident pointed to future \ntrouble.13 Finally, on 4 March, a group of militants from the \nTPLA kidnapped four US airmen from a US sigint base in Ankara \nknown as USM-49.14 \nThe hostages were returning to their accommodation in an \nAir Force station wagon manned by a Turkish driver after a \nmonitoring shift. They were following their usual route, a \nnarrow and icy road, when they were forced to stop by a road\u00ad\nblock. Several men loitering by the side of the road were \nsuddenly joined by others brandishing sub-machine guns and \ngrenades. The airmen expected to be shot immediately, but \ninstead they were frogmarched away to a waiting car. The whole \nparty then drove off in convoy, led by the captured station \nwagon. Although they were asked to keep their eyes shut, the \nAmericans were neither bound nor blindfolded. At least one of \nthem reckoned he could probably have made a successful \ngetaway, but he feared the consequences for the remaining \ncaptives. IS \nOne of the kidnappers then took the station wagon for \ndisposal. Foolishly, he attempted to abandon it near the Soviet \n304 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nEmbassy, which had a strong police presence. He was immedi\u00ad\nately arrested and successfully interrogated, revealing the names \nof the leading kidnappers, but not their location. He explained \nthat they had all been trained by the Palestinian group 'Fatah' \nin Syria during 1970. MIT, the Turkish National Intelligence \nAgency, concluded that the hostages were being held on the \nnearby campus of the Middle East Technical University. \nAccordingly, early on 5 March the campus was cordoned off, \nand a massive security search began. The campus was vast, and \nincluded five miles of underground heating ducts which were \nexamined inch by inch. Armed students barricaded themselves \nin the dormitories, and there were prolonged exchanges of fire. \nA student and a soldier were killed, and many were wounded. \nWeapons were recovered and two thousand students were \ndetained, but there was no sign of the US airmen.16 \nImprobably, the hostages had been taken to a luxury apart\u00ad\nment not far from the embassy quarter. For the next five days \nthey were kept cooped up in a closet, interspersed with occa\u00ad\nsional periods when they were allowed to sit in the hallway for \nrelief. The kidnappers treated their captives respectfully. They \nprovided playing cards, and eventually the airmen developed \nan improvised chess set. The Americans had offered all their \nvaluables in return for release, but their captors showed no \ninterest. The TPLA began to issue demands, and threatened to \nput all the four airmen in front of a firing squad unless they \nwere complied with. They included broadcasts of anti-American \ndeclamations on Turkish radio, and the payment of $400,000 \nwithin thirty-six hours. A little later they contacted the US \nEmbassy, extending the deadline and sending a package \ncontaining short letters from the airmen to their families, \ntogether with one of their identity cards. There was now exten\u00ad\nsive press coverage of the crisis, but the real role of the airmen \nas sigint operators remained a secret. \nPresident Nixon took a hard line. On the day of the abduc\u00ad\ntion he told a White House news conference that he was not \nasking the Turkish government to negotiate with the kidnap-\nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 305 \npers, and would leave operational decisions to AnkaraY \nUnbeknown to Nixon, the airmen were allowed to listen to the \nradio, and his comments sent them into a deep depression. They \nfeared their chances were now 'down the drain'. The US \nAmbassador in Turkey, William J. Hanley, received a cable from \nWashington on the same day underlining Nixon's tough posi\u00ad\ntion and opposing any ransom payment, for fear that it would \nencourage further kidnappings. Nevertheless, the Turkish \ngovernment broadcast a version of one of the TPLA's Marxist \nproclamations, in order to play for time. Meanwhile, MIT master\u00ad\nminded an extraordinary security operation. Thirty thousand \ntroops and police were mobilised in a massive sweep of several \nsections of Ankara. The security forces combed the poorer areas \nof the city and revisited parts of the university campus. One \nmember of the Turkish Cabinet declared, 'You don't bargain \nwith bandits.'IB \nBehind the scenes, the US Information Service arranged for \nTurkish television to interview the pregnant wife of one of the \nairmen, Jimmie Sexton, and sent photographs of their thirteen\u00ad\nmonth-old son Anthony to local newspapers. Her direct and \nemotional appeal had a substantial effect on public opinion. \nLater, under police questioning, the kidnappers would concede \nthat they had felt the tide of public sentiment turning against \nthem. Once the deadlines expired, the five kidnappers became \nmore nervous. They chose to relieve their anxiety by cleaning \ntheir guns in full view of the airmen, and took pleasure in \naiming their unloaded weapons at them and pulling the trigger. \nThey clearly loved their abundant weaponry: one of them was \nso festooned with belts of ammunition and hand grenades that \nthe airmen christened him 'the walking arsenal'. The kidnap\u00ad\npers Legan to discuss taking their captives away to the east and \nthen out of the country. At one point the airmen feared they \nwould be taken to Syria, and then perhaps even on to the Soviet \nUnion.I9 \nAt about 10 o'clock in the evening of 8 March, by complete \nchance, local police were called to investigate a domestic quarrel \n306 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nclose to the kidnappers' apartment. The kidnappers believed \nthat they had been located, and told the airmen to lie on the \nfloor in the dark. Waiting in the pitch black, they expected a \ngun battle to erupt at any moment. After a long period of time \nthey realised their kidnappers had fled. Putting on civilian clothes \nthey found in the apartment, they crept out and eventually \nfound a taxi. First they went to the American Embassy, but the \nhuge crowd of press and government officials was so alarming \nthat instead they headed back to their billets, and reported their \nescape there. It turned out that they had been held only seven \nhundred yards from the American Embassy. Later, Ambassador \nHanley tried to defend the policy of not paying the ransom. The \nairmen were not impressed, and retorted that when you are \nbeing held at gunpoint 'you don't really care about what might \nhappen to somebody else. All you care about is getting out in \none piece yourself:20 \nThe broad effect of the kidnap operation was to ratchet up \nthe pressure on all sides. In April 1971 a new government was \nformed under Nihar Erim, which wasted no time in rounding \nup hundreds of suspects and declaring martial law in eleven \nprovinces. Many trade unionists and academics who had nothing \nto do with the TPLA were jailed, and newspapers were shut \ndown.21 Four of the five kidnappers were caught on their way \nto the TPLA's headquarters at the mountain stronghold of \nMalatya in south-eastern Turkey. The only one who remained \nat large, Sinan Cemgil, was soon planning another attack. The \ntarget was the important American intelligence site at Pirinclik \nAir Base in south -east Turkey, near Diyarbakir. This was a \ncombined radar and elint operation that monitored missiles \nlaunched from the ultra-modern Soviet testing grounds at \nTyuratam on the Aral Sea.22 On 28 April, having trained a new \ncadre of militants, the TPLA force made their way towards the \nsite, but Turkish intelligence had an agent on the inside, and \nthey were intercepted by the security forces. Cemgill and many \nof his adherents died in the prolonged gun battle that followed.23 \nBy early May the security situation seemed superficially to \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 307 \nbe under control. One of the kidnappers of the US airmen was \ndead, and the remaining four were in prison. During the summer \nthree of these prisoners, who were prominent figures in the \nTPLA, would be sentenced to be hanged. However, it was clear \nthat the terrorists now considered themselves to be at war with \nthe intelligence and security services -not only the Thrkish \nagencies like MIT, but also those of Thrkey's allies. Moreover, \nwith good contacts inside the government ministries, they were \nable to secure sensitive information about which bases had intel\u00ad\nligence functions and constituted the most attractive targets. \nThe presence of several key terrorist leaders awaiting the death \nsentence in Thrkish jails was also a likely spur to further action. \nJust after midday on 17 May 1971, members of the TPLF \nkidnapped Ephraim Elrom, the Israeli Consul General in IstanbuL \nas he returned to his apartment for lunch. He did this every \nday, never varying his schedule, and his predictable movements \nmade him an easy target. After the kidnapping of the US airmen \nhe had been offered a bodyguard, but had refused. Heavily \narmed kidnappers took over the flat across the hall from his, \nholding twelve people prisoner while they waited. Elrom was \ngreeted at gunpoint and resisted, but was pistol-whipped until \nhe was semi-conscious. Bundled into a large leather bag, he \nwas taken away in a stolen car. The terrorists were quick to \nannounce their demands, which amounted simply to the release \nof all previously captured TPLA members and publicity for their \nMarxist manifesto. They set a three-day deadline of 5 o'clock \non the afternoon of 20 May. \nThe public were not aware of Ephraim Elrom's true profile. \nAlthough fifty-eight years old, he had only entered the Israeli \ndiplomatic corps less than three years previously, after the tragic \ndeath of his son in an aircraft accident. Istanbul was his first \ndiplomatic posting, and he had served there for nineteen months. \nPreviously he had been a distinguished security intelligence \nofficer, and Israel's most skilled interrogator. Most importantly, \nhe had been the lead member of the team that had interro\u00ad\ngated Adolf Eichmann after his capture by Mossad in Argentina \n308 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nin May 1960. The widespread assumption amongst the foreign \ndiplomatic corps in Ankara was that Elrom had been targeted \nfor anti-Zionist reasons, reflecting his role in bringing Eichmann \nto justice. However, the British Ambassador in Turkey, Sir \nRoderick Sarell, knew he had really been selected because of \nhis intelligence liaison role. Elrom's main functions in Turkey \nseem to have been to exchange intelligence with the Turkish \nagencies on Turks who had joined Arab terrorist groups such \nas Fatah, and to help with the training of Turkish counter-terror \nunits. Sarell learned from the Israelis that they had been \nwatching the TPLA, and knew that over a hundred Turks were \ntraining in Syria, Jordan and the Lebanon.24 It was now clear \nthat the extremists were deliberately going after intelligence \npersonnel. 25 \nOn 17 May the Turkish government warned that if Elrom \nwas not released, many more people would be imprisoned. They \nwere also preparing a law that made sheltering or supporting \nkidnap groups automatically subject to the death penalty, and \nthreatened to make this retroactive, executing anyone associ\u00ad\nated with the kidnapping of Elrom. The Israelis backed this \ntough response. The next day, Turkey's National Security Council \nmet and was given an intelligence briefing by MIT. Afterwards \nthey rounded up four hundred leftists, students and dissidents. \nTorture was used in the hope of extracting information about \nthe kidnappers. Their hard line reflected a growing conviction \non the part of Turkish intelligence that there was strong Syrian \nor even Soviet support for both the TPLF and the TPLA; some \nof the activists involved in the kidnapping of the airmen had \nbeen part of the original group of eleven students caught on \nthe Syrian border with explosives and guns in 1970.26 \nThe TPLF operation to kidnap Elrom was complex. Several \napartments had been rented as safe houses, and numerous \nmembers of the group were involved indirectly in support teams. \nOn 19 May the kidnappers held a meeting in a nearby safe \nhouse with other TPLF leaders, but they were divided about \nElrom's fate. On 20 May Elrom's wife issued a public statement \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 309 \nasking the kidnappers to release her husband, adding that they \nhad lost their only child, and that she could not bear the further \nloss of her husband. At this point most Turkish politicians \nbelieved that no extremist group would execute a foreign \ndiplomat. The following day, the authorities announced a curfew \nand began a methodical search of houses in the Istanbul area, \na sprawling city of two million people. \nBy midday, two members of the kidnappers' extensive support \nteam had been caught, and pressure was building. They opted \nto try to move Elrom using a furniture removal van as cover. \nFearing that they had been spotted, they panicked and decided \nto kill their hostage, flipping a coin to determine who would \ndo the deed before the rest fled to various bolt-holes around \nIstanbul. Mahir Cayan, to whom the task had fallen, turned a \nradio up as loud as possible to try to mask the sound of the \nexecution. At exactly 6.30 p.m. he approached Elrom, who was \nbound to a chair, and fired three shots into his temple. His body \nwas found by a routine search team in the early hours of the \nfollowing morning, in an apartment block only five hundred \nyards from the Israeli Consulate.27 \nThe government reaction was draconian. Four thousand \nsuspects were arrested, many further leftist newspapers were \nbanned and civil rights were drastically curtailed. All the \nmembers of the gang that had taken EIrom were eventually \nlocated, and either died resisting arrest or were imprisoned. It \ntranspired that their initial target had been the CIA station in \nIstanbul, but they had concluded that the security there was \ntoo good. With security for military and diplomatic personnel \nin Turkey's major cities greatly strengthened, many concluded \nthat the spate of kidnappings was now over. \nThe following autumn the Turkish government announced \ndeath sentences for eighteen members of the TPLA and the \nTPLF. Istanbul's educated elite were shocked, and Western diplo\u00ad\nmats who moved in middle-class circles reported that many \nvisibly 'shudder at the thought of the barbarities of hanging'. \nHowever, in the street, the taxi drivers and cobblers expressed \n310 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nsatisfaction; their 'virtually unanimous reaction' was that the \n'students must hang'. They added that the terrorists were the \n'spoiled children of wealth', and stern action was needed to halt \nthe attacks.28 \nIn fact the worst was yet to come. The impending execution of \nsome of their comrades prompted the radical groups to use their \ningenuity. On 29 November 1971, five of the most prominent \nmilitants escaped from a high-security military prison. They \nconsisted of the three survivors from the killing of Elrom -\nincluding Mahir Cayan, who had pulled the trigger -and two \nmembers of the group that had kidnapped the sigint airmen. \nThe press reported that they had escaped through a tunnel \nduring an orchestrated riot. In fact the escape was facilitated by \nmilitary officers sympathetic to the prisoners' anti-imperialist \nagenda. Some of the guards were later convicted of deliberately \nnot taking roll calls and could not explain how the escapees \nhad been able to drive away calmly in a military vehicle. \nMeanwhile, the fighters from the terrorist units of the hitherto \nlargely separate TPLF and TPLA had now made common cause \nin jail. 29 \nOne of the five escapees was soon killed by the security ser\u00ad\nvices, having chosen to hide out in a flat immediately beneath \nthat of one of Istanbul's senior police officers. Another was \nrecaptured in Istanbul. However, in early 1972 the other three \nwere still on the 100se.3o No one doubted that they would seek \nto obtain the release of their remaining comrades in prison by \ntaking further hostages. Those still incarcerated included Deniz \nGezmi~, who had led the kidnapping of the sigint airmen \nand whose death sentence had been confirmed by the Turkish \nCourt of Appeal on 10 January, and two of the TPLA group \nthat had killed Elrom, who were also sentenced to death. With \na total of 353 activists sentenced to long terms in prison and a \nfurther eighteen facing the death penalty, the stakes were now \nhigh.3l \nLed by Mahir Cayan, the escapees made their way to Ankara, \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 31 1 \nwhere they enjoyed a strong network of support. On 24 January \nthe Turkish Interior Minister told parliament that intelligence \non further plots had been obtained, and new groups of terror\u00ad\nists were training abroad. As a result, the parliament voted to \nextend the period of martial law.32 Although the trials of most \nof the activists were public, additional military tribunals were \nproceeding in secret. In March no fewer than fifty-seven offi\u00ad\ncers were removed from the armed forces and were awaiting \ntrial on charges of assisting the TPLA. Their crimes ranged from \nproviding target intelligence and supplying arms, to aiding the \nfive prison escapees in November 1971.33 Nervous of further \nescape attempts, some of tbe convoys taking the accused from \njails to the courts were now escorted by tanks.34 \nOn 14 March 1972 the American Embassy received a warning \nfrom the Turkish intelligence services that because of the \nimpending execution of three of the most prominent terrorists, \nincluding Deniz Gezmi~, further kidnap attempts were likely. \nThe Americans regarded the warning as 'particularly significant', \nand concluded that the danger of kidnapping would remain \nhigh for some time to come.35 A week later, President Cevdet \nSunay signed the order for the executions to go ahead in the \nnext few weeks.36 \nAlways looking for a high-profile target, the TPLA leader in \nIstanbul proposed the occupation of a Western embassy, but \nafter some reconnaissance work it was concluded that security \nwas so tight that the scheme was abandoned. Instead, they \nturned their attention to the more remote intelligence bases. \nThey now chose a GCHQ sigint site at Carsamba, near the Black \nSea town of Unye, where new equipment made by Plessey and \nMarconi was being installed. This was close to a larger American \nsigint site at Samsun. Surprisingly, despite the kidnapping of \nthe American sigint personnel the previous year, security was \npoor. The kidnapping operation was led by Mahir Cayan, and \nhad strong local support from left-wing lawyers and teachers \nwho had been sacked as a result of the recent government clamp\u00ad\ndown, and were happy to assist the militants. They knew that \n312 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nthere was no security at the GCHQ accommodation areas, which \nwere in the neighbouring village of Unye. \nOn 26 March 1972 Cayan and his team, disguised as Turkish \nofficers and carrying Sten guns, were able simply to walk into \nthe accommodation block where eight GCHQ technicians were \nhaving dinner. First they forced their captives to open the safe, \nand stole documents and money. Then they asked, 'Who of you \nis the toughest?', chose three hostages and tied up the rest, \ngiving themselves a ten-hour start.37 The abductees were two \nBritish nationals, Gordon Banner and Charles Turner, and a \nCanadian, Johu Law. All three were sigint technicians whose \ncover story was that they were staff from Cable & Wireless Ltd \ndoing contract work for the Ministry of Defence. However, \nrecently declassified documents confirm that they were in fact \nfull-time GCHQ staff. Bundled into a truck, they were driven \naway from the coast over winding roads towards the mountain \nvillage of Kizildere, which was a TPLA stronghold. Five more \nTPLA members were waiting in the house of the local Mayor, \nwhich became their base. The Turkish Foreign Ministry later \nexplained that it was worried about the safety of the fifty GCHQ \nstaff working in Turkey at the two other GCHQ sites because it \nfeared that Communist sympathisers within the Turkish Air \nForce might have tipped off the kidnappers about their routine \nmovements.38 \nThe British Foreign Secretary, Alec Douglas-Home, quickly \ndeduced that the main purpose of the kidnapping was to force \nthe release of the three most prominent members of the TPLA \nand TPLF who were under imminent sentence of death in \nIstanbul. He asked Roderick SareH, the British Ambassador in \nAnkara, to discreetly enquire what was being done about the \ndeath sentences. The first thing the Turkish government did was \nto postpone the executions.39 On 28 March the Prime Minister, \nDr Nihat Erim, wrote to the British Prime Minister, Edward \nHeath, thanking him for expressing confidence in the Turkish \neffort and assuring him that the country's' entire security forces' \nwere attempting the rescue of the three hostages.4o Although \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 313 \nDouglas- Home had received assurances from Cheltenham, he \nnevertheless asked Roderick Sarell to double-check that the secu\u00ad\nrity precautions to protect the remaining personnel at Unye and \nthe two other Black Sea sites were indeed adequate.41 \nThe next day, Douglas-Home made an optimistic statement \nin the House of Commons. He perpetuated the cover story that \nthe hostages were 'three Ministry of Defence civilian radar oper\u00ad\nators', working with the Thrkish Air Force.42 However, even as \nhe spoke, the Thrkish Prime Minister made a hard-hitting TV \naddress which closed the door on any bargaining with the \nkidnappers over the impending death sentences. 'It is an empty \ndream on their part,' he declared, 'to imagine that this kidnap\u00ad\nping will yield any result for them.' He was determined to resist \n'blackmail', and insisted that the kidnappers would be 'hunted \ndown'. The law, he added, would be enforced 'to the bitter \nend'.43 True to his word, a massive search of the area surrounding \nthe half-finished GCHQ facility at Carsamba was launched. \nCommandos with helicopters were brought in, and by 29 March \nthe hide-out at Kizildere had been located. Operations on the \nground were led in person by the Turkish Interior Minister, Ferit \nKubat, who was accompanied by a posse of journalists. The \nnext day, at 5.30 in the morning, he began talking directly to \nthe terrorists through an open window in the Mayor's house. \nWhen he told them to give up the hostages and surrender, the \nterrorists insisted on the release of their three comrades awaiting \ndeath in Ankara. Later they reduced their demands to their own \nsafe passage to the Syrian border. Kubat insisted that they \nsurrender unconditionally. \nThese tense personal exchanges continued for some time. \nErtugrul Kurku, one of the TPLA gunmen, recalls that at a \ncertain point in the proceedings, the terrorists brought the \nhostage Charles Thrner, who was the leader of the GCHQ party, \nto the window and allowed him to talk to the Interior Minister. \nThrner shouted anxiously, 'Don't fire. If you do so they will kill \nus.' He explained that the kidnappers were desperate, and effec\u00ad\ntively regarded themselves as a suicide squad, determined to \n314 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nsucceed, or else to die in the attempt. The security forces were \nincreasingly frustrated, and shouted back: 'They have no human \nfeelings any more. They will kill you anyway!' Turner repeated \nthat if the security forces opened fire, they would be killed \nimmediately. \nEventually, at about midday a local sympathiser, Sener Sadi, \na Marxist lawyer, was brought to the village to try to break the \ndeadlock. He was taken to the operations centre, a farm building \nnot far from the Mayor's house, where he met Kubat and a \nslightly sinister-looking intelligence chief from MIT, wearing \nsunglasses and a fur-collared coat. After long discussions, Sadi \nagreed to advise the kidnappers to surrender. He called to them \nthrough a window and through holes they had made in the \nroof of the Mayor's house, telling them that if they surrendered \nand did not harm the hostages, nothing would happen to them. \nThis met with expressions of incredulity from the kidnappers. \nThe security forces then shouted that the kidnappers would die \nin any case.44 What happened next is disputed, but Ertugrul \nKurku, the sole surviving kidnapper, recalls: \n* At 14.20 hours firing started from the houses around us. \n[Mahir] Cayan, Saffet Alp and I were upstairs. We were \ntaken aback by the firing and jumped down. Mahir [Cayan] \nshouted 'Ingilizler' [The British] ... His warm blood was \ndripping down onto me from upstairs. I saw Mahir Cayan's \narm dangling out of the hole upstairs. I ran up. However, \nbecause firing continued, I could not pull him down. I \ntouched his body. He had been shot through the head. He \nwas dead. I came down. While I was seeing to Mahir, one \nor more of our friends had killed the Britishers ... 45 \n* Accounts differ as to who shot first. The terrorists' supporters \ninsisted that it was the Turkish special forces who began the \nfiring, after which everyone else joined in.46 The military insist \nthat they only fired once they heard shooting within the house, \nand presumed that Mayir Cahan was killing the hostagesY Either \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 315 \nway, the kidnappers and the special forces were now freely \nexchanging automatic fire. The terrorists threw grenades, and \nthe authorities replied with an RPG-7 rocket launcher and later \na mortar. They then tried teargas, but the kidnappers continued \nto fire as they rushed the building. All three hostages had already \nbeen tied up and executed at close range with pistols. After the \nintense firefight the building was searched, and all but one of \nthe terrorists was also found to be dead.48 \nThe surviving terrorist, Ertugrul Kurku, had taken up a posi\u00ad\ntion near the door, armed with two sub-machine pistols which \nhe fired together. However, when grenades and rockets started \nto explode, he retreaterl into an adjacent barn, and seems to \nhave hidden under a haystack, where he was eventually discov\u00ad\nered. Some have alleged that he might have been an informant \nof the Turkish intelligence service. After the fighting was over, \na note was found under a bloodstained pillow near to where \nthe three GCHQ technicians were murdered which suggested \nthat the terrorists were effectively seeking martyrdom. It declared \nthat everyone 'dies sooner or later', and that the 'revolutionary \npath is difficult' and is 'lighted with blood of every guerrilla that \nfalls' .49 \nSome of the wives, children and friends of the three hostages \nhad gathered at the British Embassy in Ankara, hoping for a \nsuccessful resolution. The Ambassador now had the sad duty \nof explaining that things had gone very badly.50 The Turkish \nPrime Minister, Nihat Erim, wrote to Edward Heath expressing \nhis shock and grief at the 'senseless murder' of the technicians \nand asking for his condolences to be passed on to the families. \nHe also offered his assurance that no effort would be spared in \ntracking down the 'relentless desperadoes' who were respon\u00ad\nsible for this 'dastardly crime'. Heath responded by praising the \nenergy of the security forces 'despite the tragic outcome'.51 \nRoderick Sarell had sent a flash message to Heath's private secre\u00ad\ntary stating that the kidnappers had blown themselves up, and \nthat the Turkish Army 'to the last refrained from firing'. This \nwas hardly an accurate account of the proceedings. 52 Heath sent \n316 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nmessages of sympathy to the wives of Gordon Banner and \nCharles Turner.53 In Istanbul the leftists protested against the \ndeath of so many of their fighters with a series of bombings \naround the city on 30 March and again on 5 April,54 \nIt was only on 5 April, when Embassy officials received the \npersonal effects of the three GCHQ staff from their apartment \nat Unye, that they discovered a lengthy ransom note left by the \nkidnappers. The other five GCHQ technicians, who had been \nheld briefly but not taken, were security-conscious, and had \nthrown scattered papers, including the ransom note, into a desk \nand locked it. American officials observed that the existence of \nthe note had been kept a secret, and it had not been shown to \nthe families. They added that 'its late discovery is embarrassing \nto the British Embassy'. The last section of the overlooked \nransom note read: \n* As our Peoples Revolutionary Vanguard we, expressing with \naction this wish and protest say: if it is wished that in the \nTurkey of 1972 a single patriots or vanguard warrior's life \nshould be ended by the rope of oligarchy, the Peoples \nRevolutionary Vanguard, that is us, will liquidate with \nbullets these British agents also. \nIf we may put it briefly: For saving the lives of these \nBritish agents who work for NATO, the military organ of \nAnglo-American Imperialism, the chief enemy of the people \nof the world, our conditions are plain. \nThe executions will be called off immediately. \n* Richard Fyjis-Walker, the British Counsellor, commented that \nwhile the late discovery of the note was embarrassing, had it \nbeen found earlier it would not have changed the course of \nevents. More embarrassing was a further discovery made by \nBritish intelligence officers who were working with GCHQ to \ninvestigate the incident. It turned out that the kidnappers had \nenjoyed easy access to the GCHQ technicians because they 'had \nthe misfortune to be living above the local cell leader of the \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 317 \nTurkish People's Revolutionary Army'. Whoever had done the \nsecurity checks on the billets for the GCHQ staff probably had \na little explaining to do.55 \nThe TPLA were not quite finished with their spate of terror. \nThey attempted three further operations in an effort to secure \nthe release of their jailed colleagues, hijacking a Turkish Airlines \nflight to Sofia in Bulgaria, then attempting, but failing, to capture \ntwo Turkish policemen and to assassinate the Turkish General \nin charge of martial law in Ankara. Once again the TPLA demon\u00ad\nstrated what British officials described as access to 'good local \nintelligence'. 56 IIi. response, judicial proceedings were acceler\u00ad\nated, and the three TPLA leaders who the terrorists had \nattempted to have freed were hanged on 6 May 1972. Having \nmade a loud proclamation of their belief in Marxist revolution, \neach was allowed to kick out the chair from under himself. \nHowever, being denied the services of a proper gallows, their \ndeaths were prolonged and agonising. 57 On 19 June there was \nan assassination attempt on another GCHQ technician involved \nin the same Black Sea project, but he escaped unhurt. 58 \nThe following year, the widows of the murdered technicians \nbrought a case for compensation against the British govern\u00ad\nment, supported by their trade union.59 The authorities did not \nacquit themselves well. One of the issues that appears to have \ncaused official anxiety was the belatedly discovered ransom \nnote. As the court case approached, Georgina Wright, head of \nthe Foreign Office South-East European Department, noted: 'The \ndemand note could cause problems -we did not release infor\u00ad\nmation about it at the time as it was found in the flat from \nwhich the technicians were kidnapped a week after the \nmurder.'60 Her colleagues noted that there were other docu\u00ad\nments that would cause 'serious difficulties' if they were released \nto the court.61 There was also a more general wish to conceal \nGCHQ's involvement in the affair from public view.62 \nIn the event, the claims were dealt with by John Somerville, \nGCHQ's Principal Establishment Officer.63 Somerville had been \nout to Turkey in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. He \n318 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nalso allowed the solicitors of the widows to speak to two of the \ntechnicians who were not taken, once they had been security \nvetted.64 With the support of the trade union, Beryl Turner, the \nwidow of Charles Turner, pursued an action alleging govern\u00ad\nment negligence in which her husband was described as 'a civil \nservant'. She argued that the attack was 'reasonably foresee\u00ad\nable', given that 'certain American personnel employed in a \nsimilar capacity to the deceased', as well as the Israeli Consul \nGeneral, had been kidnapped in the previous twelve months, \nand that the GCHQ staff were not warned, no secure accom\u00ad\nmodation was offefed and no guards provided. Understandably, \nwhat seemed to vex her most was the fact that the landlord \nwho had provided the accommodation for the technicians was \na local leader of the TPLA.65 \nGCHQ attempted to argue that, at the time, the violent attacks \nhad seemed to be limited to Ankara and Istanbul. However, this \nwas not the case, since the militants had previously mounted \na failed attack on the sigint base at Dakiyir in remote south\u00ad\neast Turkey, making it clear that all such sites were vulnerable. \nAt that point, stronger security measures probably should have \nbeen taken. Moreover, although warning circulars reached \nBritish staff at diplomatic premises, they were 'not sent to \npersonnel at the operational sites'.66 In the event, the action \nnever went to trial since GCHQ -wisely perhaps -opted to \nsettle out of court.67 Compensation of \u00a310,000 was paid to the \nfamilies, although the GCHQ aspect of the case was not publicly \nrevealed until a debate in the House of Commons ten years \nlater. 68 \nFor GCHQ, the deaths of Gordon Banner, Charles Turner and \nJohn Law were a terrible tragedy. Since the 1950s, the agency \nhad realised that collecting sigint on the Eastern Bloc would \nmean more short-range collection, more special operations and \nmore risk. Yet the British prided themselves on their profes\u00ad\nsionalism, and had lost no one in their overflights and secret \nsubmarine missions, despite some close calls. This reflected a \nmixture of sound risk-assessment and a measure of good luck. \nDISASTER AT KIZILDERE 319 \nBy contrast, the deaths at Kizildere smacked of incompetence, \nand were probably avoidable. They followed a period when \nintelligence personnel were clearly being earmarked as targets \nby a ruthless group. Indeed, on 1 June 1971, after the capture \nof the American sigint airmen, the British Ambassador, Roderick \nSarell, had expressly warned London of the 'danger of further \npolitical kidnappings to be used as a bargaining counter with \nthe authorities'. 69 \nIt seems unlikely that the Soviets were directly behind the \nattacks in Turkey. However, Moscow did hope to use the pres\u00ad\nsure generated by these incidents to reduce the Western intel\u00ad\nligence presence in the country. In 1972, NATO and the Warsaw \nPact had both withdrawn some troops from central Europe under \nKissinger's cherished Mutual Balanced Force Reduction agree\u00ad\nment. Turkey was worried that these Soviet forces might be \nredeployed close to its borders. In 1973, Soviet diplomats aired \na possible bilateral Soviet-Turkish security accord. Red Army \nunits would be withdrawn from the border with Turkey, and \nin return Ankara would close the major US-Turkish airbase at \nIncirlik and insist on the removal of communications-monitoring \nsites along the Black Sea coast.70 The regional stakes were made \nhigher by the rivalry between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, \nanother critically important listening location. By March 1972 \nBritain's Joint Intelligence Committee had already warned that \ntrouble was brewing in Cyprus, and that the question was \nlooming larger in Turkey's relations with both Britain and the \nUnited States. GCHQ might well have hoped that its troubles \nin the eastern Mediterranean were now over -but in fact they \nhad only just begun.7l \n17 \nTurmoil on Cyprus \nAt 14.26 hours one of a group of seven Turkish tanks, which had \napproached to within a few hundred yards of the NW corner of \nthe Ayios Nikolaos perimeter, fired three shells into the Sovereign \nBase Area ... \nCommander British Forces Near East, \nrecounting events of 15 August 19741 \nCyprus was a powderkeg. Repeatedly conquered by contending \nwaves of Greeks and Turks down the centuries, it had been \npopulated by settlers from both communities. In 1878 it was \nacquired by the British as a colony, and in 1960 the Cypriot \nRepublic gained independence from Britain, with its new \nPresident, Archbishop Makarios, presiding over the two commu\u00ad\nnities by means of a complicated constitution which guaran\u00ad\nteed an existence for the island that was separate from both \nGreece and Turkey. For Britain, and also the United States, a \nkey goal of the constitutional settlement had been permanent \naccess to almost a hundred square miles of military bases that \nremained British sovereign territory, and the primary purpose \nof which was the collection of signals intelligence. However, a \nnumber of prominent Greek Cypriots still hankered after 'enosis', \nor union with Greece, and since independence Greece and \nTurkey had come close to conflict over the island on several \noccasions. \nCyprus was of incredible importance to British sigint. Having \nlost its stations in Iraq, Egypt and Palestine, the island was \nGCHQ's last foothold in the Middle East. For America too, Cyprus \nwas increasingly important, given the US listening station just \nto the north of Nicosia at Yarallakos. Moreover, the Yom Kippur \nWar of 1973 and the rise of Middle East terrorism ensured that \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 321 \ndemand for sigint from the region had rocketed. Therefore, in \nthe mid -1 970s something very odd began to happen. Not only \ndid sigint support the making of foreign policy, but foreign policy \nbegan to support the collection of sigint. One might argue that \nduring this period the political future of a number of island terri\u00ad\ntories -not just Cyprus, but also Diego Garcia in the Indian \nOcean and Ascension Island in the Atlantic -were largely shaped \nby their value as listening stations. The sigint tail had begun to \nwag the policy dog. There can be no clearer indication of the \nimportance of GCHQ and NSA in the last quarter of the twen\u00ad\ntieth century than their powerful influence on the history of \nCyprus. \nFor two decades, Cyprus had not only been a superb source \nof intelligence on events in the Middle East through comint, it \nhad also provided spectacular intelligence on Soviet strategic \nweapons and been the West's most important source of war \nwarning. What had long bothered Britain's intelligence experts \nmost was the possibility of surprise attack. If the Soviets opted \nfor full mobilisation, or if they involved the rest of the Warsaw \nPact in war preparCltions, Britain expected to know about it at \nleast a month in advance, since such activities would be hard \nto disguise. However, if they launched a surprise nuclear attack \nwith missiles and aircraft, the chances of warning about this \nwere poor. The JIC had warned: \n* We could be certain that a decision to attack had been \nmade only if we succeeded in intercepting the decision. \nWe have virtually no chance of doing this and we must, \ntherefore, rely on interpreting the significance of military \nand other moves and preparations: in the event of a surprise \nattack we may never obtain such information. \n* In other words, sigint was not expected to offer reliable \nadvance warning. However, British intelligence was working on \na top-secret solution to this seemingly impossible problem, code\u00ad\nnamed 'Project Sandra'.2 \n322 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nProject Sandra was a highly classified facility that was being \ndeveloped on Cyprus. The equipment involved was partly a \nform of sigint collection and partly a kind of Over the Horizon \nRadar.3 It bounced radio waves off layers in the upper atmos\u00ad\nphere and down onto its target well beyond the horizon, as \nwould later be unsuccessfully attempted at Orford Ness. \nHowever, in Cyprus, unlike Suffolk, conditions were perfect, \ngiving a range of as much as two thousand miles. This offered \nthe possibility of looking deep inside southern Russia, the heart \nof the missile-and aircraft-testing area. With many operational \nrocket sites and Lomber bases, this region was also the most \nlikely source of a sneak attack by Russia. The prototype was \ncode-named 'Zinnia', and was initially developed by the Division \nof Scientific Intelligence with assistance from GCHQ. Begun in \nits earliest form in 1955, Zinnia was originally intended for the \nsurveillance of aircraft, but by 1959 it had been extended to \nmissiles. Its radar used a constant wave rather than pulsed trans\u00ad\nmissions to avoid disclosing its purpose.4 The scientific intelli\u00ad\ngence branch of the CIA became a development partner, and \nin late 1960 new versions of Zinnia were tested at Cape \nCanaveral, detecting the full range of American rocketry, \nincluding Atlas, Jupiter, Thor, Titan and even an early version \nof the Polaris missile. Tvventy missiles were fired in all, and \nZinnia performed brilliantly. 5 \nThe final decision to initiate Project Sandra, taken on 1 \nNovember 1961, was a difficult one, since Britain enjoyed other \nsecret sources of intelligence on Soviet missiles.6 The previous \nyear, SIS had achieved one of the greatest agent recruitments \nof the Cold War. This was Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, a Soviet \nArmy missile expert who was providing superb intelligence on \nMoscow's strategic forces. Burke Trend, the Cabinet Secretary, \nexplained the complex relationship between Project Sandra and \nthe material provided by Penkovsky: 'Sited in Cyprus ... it would \nafford a check on intelligence obtained from another source and \nin the event of the failure of the latter, would become much \nmore important. But in addition it would provide significant \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 323 \nintelligence which the other source could not.n Trend under\u00ad\nstood that the situatian of any agent inside the Eastern Bloc \nwas perilous, and indeed his observations turned out to be all \ntoo prescient. Penkovskv was caught meeting a go-between of \nSIS in the autumn of 1962. Arrested by the KGB and put on \ntriaL he was shot the following year, even before the construc\u00ad\ntion of Sandra was completed.s Work now accelerated, with \nSandra's transmitter located in the west of Cyprus at RAF \nAkrotiri, while the receiver was located in the east, at the RAF \nsigint base at Pergamos.9 \nProject Sandra provided early warning to all of NATO, and \nhad a top-secret link to the American Sixth Fleet in the \nMediterranean. Its success was the inspiration for further stations \nin Pakistan and Taiwan in the 1960s, as well as the failed exper\u00ad\niment at Orford Ness in the early 1970s.1O Sandra's high perform\u00ad\nance had much to do with the peculiarly beneficial location of \nCyprus for the reception of signals, and for this reason the island \nsimply bristled with aerials. II However, by 1970 the nature of \nthe intelligence stations on Cyprus was changing. Alongside the \nveteran Project Sandra, the Americans had been permitted to \nconstruct their own special installation, code-named 'Cobra \nShoe', to improve early warning to the US Sixth Fleet.I2 Cobra \nShoe was a more powerful and up-to-date version of Sandra. \nThe Americans also built a new missile-early-warning system \nalongside it.13 This was the most advanced intelligence site \ncovering Russia, and was 'run by the RAF for the USAF', \nalthough that fact was hidden from the Cypriot government.I4 \nIndeed, the island's authorities were highly allergic to any US \nintelligence presence, so American technicians visiting the twin \nsites had to keep a very low profile.Is \nAll through the early 1970s there were signs of inter-communal \ntrouble on Cyprus. On 8 March 1970 the President, Archbishop \nMakarios, escaped an assassination attempt by a whisker. A few \ndays later, Polycarpos Georkadijis, the long-serving Minister of \nthe Interior, was killed in a similar attack. Georkadijis's death \n324 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwas perhaps not surprising, since he was, according to local \nAmerican diplomats, 'the arch-conspirator' of Cyprus, a 'survivor \nof many plots and gun battles' and 'the repository of many dark \nsecrets'. The attempt to kill Archbishop Makarios was more \nshocking, since he was widely accepted as the politicaL emotional \nand indeed religious leader of all Greek Cypriots. These dramatic \nevents brought into question many of the fundamental assump\u00ad\ntions about the island's politics. In the short term, the position \nof Makarios had strengthened, but the future was uncertain. \nBritish and American officials thought it not unlikely that Greek \nofficers dreaming of union with Greece might have been behind \nthe attack, and concluded that the renegades might well try \nagain.16 \nOn the morning of 15 July 1974, the Greek junta in Athens \nlaunched a surprise coup attempt against the government of \nMakarios, who was opposed to enosis. The junta's chosen instru\u00ad\nment was some officers they had loaned to the Greek Cypriot \nNational Guard, which served as a focus for the radical pro\u00ad\nenosis faction. Under orders from Athens, they stormed the pres\u00ad\nidential palace in 2.n attempt to kill Makarios. Despite the fact \nthat the CIA was close to the junta, American intelligence \nreceived no warning. Athens claimed, implausibly, that its hand \nhad been forced by impetuous local officers, but its CIA patrons \ndid not believe this for a moment.17 The British rescued Makarios \nby helicopter, and whisked him away to safety on Malta. Fighting \nnow developed across the whole island, threatening the status \nquo between the two communities. All sides recognised that \nthis reckless move was likely to trigger a Turkish military inter\u00ad\nvention. The British Foreign Secretary, James Callaghan, hoped \nto persuade Henry Kissinger that it was worth putting pressure \non the Greek junta to end their ill-considered adventure, but \nWashington was treading carefully for fear that Athens would \nretaliate by withdrawing base rights for the American Sixth \nFleet. 18 \nOn Cyprus, British commanders were initially faced with the \ntask of trying to return some 3,500 local civilian base workers \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 325 \nfrom RAF Akrotiri to their homes in the capital of Limassol. \nOfficers thought they had negotiated safe passage for them, but \nas they made their way along the road towards Limassol, there \nwas renewed fighting. By late afternoon the convoy had become \nstranded, and was unable to turn around. A large band of Greek \nirregulars had drawn up alongside it, 'armed with anything from \nmuzzle-loaders to World War II Japanese field guns'. Heavy \nfighting was developing only a few hundred yards away, and \nthe convoy eventually retreated back to Akrotiri. In Limassol, \nsome British married quarters were commandeered by the \nvarious factions as machine-gun positions. 'One wife who \nsuffered such an intrusion recovered several hundred expended \ncartridge cases from her living room carpet next morning.'19 \nThe initial coup against Makarios took British intelligence by \nsurprise: the Foreign Secretary at the time, James Callaghan, \nrecalled that he had no idea what was about to unfold.20 However, \ncoverage of the subsequent crisis was good, partly from inter\u00ad\nception of high-level Turkish military communications.21 On 17 \nJuly the JIC provided a clear forecast of the Turkish response, \nwhich was a large-scale invasion. More than two days before \nthe Turks landed, it warned: 'We believe that the Turks are now \nmilitarily ready to intervene if the Turkish Cypriot community \nis physically threatened or if Enosis is declared, but will try for \nthe moment, through diplomatic efforts, to bring about a solu\u00ad\ntion by other means.' Diplomatic efforts failed, and the Turkish \ninvasion was triggered.22 In fact, Turkish emissaries had arrived \nat Downing Street on the evening of 17 July, hoping to persuade \nthe British 'to declare war with them' and intervene jointly. \nBernard Donoughue, Prime Minister Harold Wilson's Senior \nPolicy Adviser, noted in his diary that when the British refused \nthe Turkish delegation left, saying 'they would do it themselves \nanyway'. His impression was that 'they would not take long'. \nSigint from GCHQ relating to the crisis was quickly forwarded \nto Washington, but the Americans were not in a position to \nmake good use of the material. At the end of the month Richard \nNixon would resign his presidency as a result of the Watergate \n326 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nscandal. Jndeed, the fact that Turkey knew the White House was \nin turmoil contributed to its decision to invade.23 \nOn the morning of 19 July, British sigint reported that the \nTurkish 39th Division, which had long been earmarked for \npossible intervention in Cyprus, was getting ready to move. At \n2.50 that afternoon the JIC issued what the British commander \non Cyprus, Sir John Aiken, called a 'remarkably accurate assess\u00ad\nment' of Turkish objectives in Cyprus and capabilities.24 Thirty \nminutes later came reports of a large force sailing from southern \nTurkey.25 The progress of this armada was tracked by Nimrod \nsorties over the night of 19-20 July. After an 'extremely tense \nnight', the Nimrod detected the main force of thirty-four vessels \noff the north coast of Cyprus, and at 4.30 a.m. it reported that \nthe Turkish fleet was turning towards the coast. Meanwhile, \nground stations captured sigint from Turkish strike aircraft lifting \noff from Antalya and Incirlik. These planes were on an attack \ncourse. 'The Nimrod was speedily withdrawn and actually \ncleared the area only a minute or so before the first wave of \nTurkish aircraft arrived.'26 This sigint was being shared in real \ntime with Washington. On the evening of 19 July -early in \nthe morning of 20 July on Cyprus -US Secretary of Defense \nJames Schlesinger phoned Kissinger and reported: 'Turks took \nseveral F-l OOs off about 3 hours ago from one of their bases in \nTurkey -they were loaded up ... My own guess is they have \na notion that before you land on a beach you are supposed to \ndrop bombs on it.' By daylight a major Turkish offensive was \nin progress, with a large parachute drop north of Nicosia.27 \nKissinger had done all he could to prevent the crisis, but now \nlamented that 'The animals are out of their cages.'28 \nHeavy fighting developed over the next ten days, and at the \nend of July, with things hotting up, Aiken, the British \ncommander in chief, decided to cease British reconnaissance \nflights over Cyprus for fear of an incident.29 Britain's SIS \nremained active because of its large station on Cyprus, and was \nat pains to keep the senior CIA officers at the American Embassy \nin London supplied with up-to-date reports. The CIA's own \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 327 \nsources on Cyprus were rather thin, so on 31 July Bill Colby, \nwho had just taken over as Director of the CIA, wrote person\u00ad\nally to the British to express his thanks for the detailed \nreporting.30 During August the Turks consolidated their hold on \nthe city of Famagusta, at the eastern end of the island. The \nbiggest problem for the British was the threat to the GCHQ's \nlarge sigint base at Ayios Nikolaos, not far away on the edge of \nthe eastern Sovereign Base Area of Dhekelia. As the Turks \nadvanced, thousands of Greek refugees fled for the protection \nof the British base. Aiken recalled that they came on foot, in \nsmart cars, on tractors and mule-drawn carts. Local commanders \nfound it 'a daunting experience to see so many people with \ndazed and fearful expressions peering through the windows'.3l \nOn 14 August, as Turkish ground forces continued to advance \ntowards the sigint base, the Foreign Office made urgent repre\u00ad\nsentations to the Turkish Ambassador in London, stressing the \n'specially sensitive problem of the British units at Ayios Nikolaos'. \nThe Turks reaffirmed their respect for the British bases. However, \nassurances in London were one thing, and action on the ground \nwas another. Dawn on 15 August heralded a major upsurge in \nviolence, with mortar and heavy-machine-gun fire and large \nartillery explosions all around the old city. 'The atmosphere was \nvery tense,' since no one knew if the Turks would stop at the \nboundary of the British bases, or encircle them. The perimeter \nof Ayios Nikolaos was being defended by the 3rd Battalion Royal \nRegiment of Fusiliers. At about 1.30 p.m. they spotted thirty\u00ad\nfive Turkish armoured vehicles three miles north of the base. \nSome headed south, and 'At 14.26 hours one of a group of \nseven Turkish tanks, which had approached to within a few \nhundred yards of the NW corner of the Ayios Nikolaos perimeter, \nfired three shells into the base area, narrowly missing a Ferret \nScout car of the 16/5 L[ancers] and a white van belonging to \nThames TV.' The television crew all scrambled aboard an exceed\u00ad\ningly crowded Ferret scout car, which then 'hastily withdrew'.32 \nThe day was saved by heroic action on the ground. At 4 p.m., \nColonel Hugh Johnstone, Commander of 9 Signals Regiment, \n328 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nthe main sigint operators at Ayios Nikolaos, accompanied by \nColonel Ian Cartwright, the commanding officer of the Fusiliers, \nwalked out from the hase towards the Turkish forces. An hour \nlater they encountered three squadrons of tanks and some \narmoured personnel carriers, which appeared to have stopped \nfor a 'brew-up'. A happy accommodation was reached after the \nBritish officers explained the demarcation of the boundary. \nMagically, the local Turkish commander then appeared and gave \nassurances that there would be no further trouble. As dusk \napproached, just as the situation appeared to be calming down, \na lone Turkish tank appeared menacingly at a checkpoint at the \nentrance to the base. It transpired that its crew 'were totally \nlose they had no radio, they had run out of main armament \nammunition, their 0.5 machine gun had jammed and they had \nrun out of fuel'. Petrol was 'hurriedly produced' and the tank \nwas sent lumbering back towards Famagusta.33 \nBy the end of August things were looking up, and a ceasefire \nwas in place. Turkey had halted its forces, having occupied the \neastern third of the island, and although 'the difficulties ahead \nwere very great', Aiken noted that the long, slow diplomatic haul \ntowards peace had started. Ironically, the security of the Sovereign \nBase Areas was 'firmer than it has been for some time', and apart \nfrom the ongoing refugee problems the situation was quiet. In \nLondon, intelligence chiefs had worried about Turkish attitudes \ntowards Britain's secret listening units. But the local information \nwas reassuring, and Aiken explained that contrary to what he \nhad been told, 'the longer-term security of the signal unit and \nAyios Nikolaos would seem to be better guaranteed by the close \npresence of the Turkish Army than it had been under the Makarios \nadministration. The Turks understood -and approved! -its func\u00ad\ntion in the NATO context.'34 In fact, during the crisis Britain had \npassed almost no intelligence to NATO, given that 'both contest\u00ad\nants are members'. Sigint personnel now resumed their normal \nduties, although NSA decided to abandon Yarallakos and join the \nBritish inside the safer Sovereign Base Areas.35 \n* * * \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 329 \nSurprisingly, the main threat to the sigint sites now came from \nLondon. During July 1974, officials had agonised over what to \ndo about Cyprus in the long term. 1Wo problems had now \nconverged. First, the sprawling nature of the sigint sites on \nCyprus, which needed vast aerial farms, made them hard to \ndefend. Second, the increasing troop requirements generated \nby the growing troubles in Northern Ireland meant that strategic \nreserves earmarked to reinforce Cyprus in a crisis were being \ndepleted. In short, there was no longer a 'fire brigade' to come \nto the rescue in a future crisis.36 This coincided with a major \ndefence review, begun by Harold Wilson, reflecting the dire state \nof the British economy. The Cabinet decided that British forces, \nincluding the sigint units, should be withdrawn completely from \nCyprus as soon as possible. Wilson's objective was that this \nshould be carried out by 31 March 1976, saving \u00a360 million. \nSenior officials, including the Cabinet Secretary Sir John Hunt, \nwarned that Washington 'will press us hard not to withdraw \nfrom Cyprus', but hoped that it could be dressed up as 'an inte\u00ad\ngral part of the settlement of the Cyprus problem'. However, \nthey also observed that: 'The American Intelligence Community \nis a powerful lobby in Washington. So our eventual decisions \non Cyprus may affect not only the continuance of the present \nvaluable Anglo-American intelligence relationship but also the \ngeneral American reaction to our overall Defence Review \nproposals.m \nWilson pressed on with his decision to leave Cyprus, and Hunt \ntravelled to Washington to break the bad news as gently as \npossible. On 12 November 1974 he met privately with Henry \nKissinger, James Schlesinger and William Colby. The meeting did \nnot go well. Kissinger's reaction was especially explosive, involving \na remarkable stream of expletives.38 Indeed, the Americans \nobjected so strongly that the British decision was put on hold.39 \nKissinger, worried about the loss of the intelligence bases and \nthinking withdrawal would have a destabilising effect on the \nregion, was determined that the British 'continue to occupy this \nsquare on the world chessboard'. London eventually capitulated, \n330 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \n'given the global importance of working closely with the \nAmericans' .40 1\\vo weeks later, Foreign Secretary Jim Callaghan \nformally assured Kissinger that 'We shall not in the present \ncircumstances proceed with our preferred policy of withdrawing \nfrom the Sovereign Base Area altogether.'41 \nBut everything was not as it appeared. Cabinet Ministers \nbelieved that Hunt had been sent to Washington to tell the \nAmericans about the demise of the Cyprus bases. In reality, GCHQ \nand the Cabinet Secretary seem to have been involved in an \naudacious game of poker with the Americans. The idea was to \npersuade them to pay for the presence on Cyprus. On the very \nday that Hunt endured the invective of Kissinger, Schlesinger and \nColby in Washington, Derek Tonkin from the Permanent Under\u00ad\nSecretary's Department was explaining the underlying strategy \n'in the strictest confidence' to planners from the BBC monitoring \nservice. The BBC was about to discuss its own radio monitoring \nstation on Cyprus with its American associates who performed \nthe same task for the CIA. Tonkin made it clear that despite the \nCabinet decision to withdraw, nothing should be taken for granted. \n'It might be,' he explained, 'that the Americans would offer to \npay for some of the facilities in Cyprus.' Indeed, he was rather \noptimistic and hoped the Americans would be willing to provide \n'substantial financial assistance'. He lamented that the British \nfinancial position was so bad that the country 'had long passed \nthe time when we might have felt embarrassed' about asking the \nAmericans for money. Meanwhile, the BBC was advised to plan \non the basis of a continued British presence on CypruS.42 \nAmerica's willingness to pay towards the costs of bases on Cyprus \nwas connected to the steep deterioration of its relations with Thrkey \nduring the invasion. Ankara had expected Washington to put pres\u00ad\nsure on Athens to stop the coup attempt against Makarios. Kissinger \nhad not done this, and instead, once the Thrkish invasion began, \nthe United States suspended military assistance to Thrkey. The \nThrks, already nurturing resentment over American efforts to deter \na Thrkish invasion of Cyprus ten years earlier, retaliated by closing \ndown the vast complex of American bases that sprawled across \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 331 \ntheir country. At a stroke, the United States lost the use of \nnumerous intelligence-gathering facilities which had cost tens of \nmillions of dollars to create and had been staffed by literally thou\u00ad\nsands of operatives. This was an earthquake in the sigint world, \nand the net result was that NSA became more dependent on \nCypruS.43 Kissinger regarded the loss of the Thrkish bases as nothing \nshort of 'a disaster'.44 NSA's relations with Thrkey had been diffi\u00ad\ncult for some time. During the 1960s the deal had been that NSA \nwould help Thrkey to expand its own sigint capability in return \nfor access to 'certain intelligence sites'. However, by the early \n1970s the cost of sigint assistance to Thrkey was rising 'astro\u00ad\nnomically'. The Americans had tried to revise the agreement, but \nthis had been indignantly rejected by Ankara.45 \nIn February 1975 Sir John Aiken was told that British forces \non Cyprus were not going home after all. However, the island \nwas now reshaped into an intelligence-only base. This meant \nthe sigint, communications and radar facilities would stay, \ntogether with airfields to provide a foothold for British and \nAmerican intelligence-gathering aircraft. Beyond this, the only \nother forces remaining were those required to defend them. In \npractice this meant about a thousand personnel, including two \nhundred civilians from GCHQ.46 The search for economies was \na strain for GCHQ, with quite a few duties being done by staff \non short visits, and there was a struggle to find volunteers.47 \nLittle of the cost of staying on Cyprus appears to have been \ndrawn from the intelligence budget.48 The British were now \nkeen to assist the Americans in using all the facilities in Cyprus. \nIn April 1975 America requested spy flights to investigate Soviet \narms shipments to Syria via the ports of Latakia and Tartus. \nThese needed to be launched frequently and at short notice, \nyet there was 'no suitable US programme that would provide \nthe intelligence'. Predictably, British intelligence officers were \ndelighted to offer a Cyprus-based operation, and explained that: \n* When faced with attempting to provide some return for \nthe enormous amounts of intelligence material provided \n332 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nby the US, the UK is always at a disadvantage by having \nso few opportunities to gain information, especially air \nphotography. To redress the imbalance, any opportunity \nthat presents itself should be exploited to the full. The \nreconnaissance of the ports of Latakia and Tartus is such \nan opportunity, especially as it has resulted from a direct \nrequest for assistance.49 \n* This coincided with the expansion of the American U-2 detach-\nment on Cyprus. The additional personnel and ground equip\u00ad\nment arrived by American transport aircraft which were \nrequested to arrive and depart after dark, to avoid local \ncuriosity. 50 \nThe American Defense Secretary, James Schlesinger, remained \nanxious about British defence cuts. In early September 1975, \nduring a NATO Nuclear Planning Group meeting at Monterey \nin California, Schlesinger had taken Roy Mason, the British \nDefence Secretary, aside and told him that he would deplore \nfurther reductions in British defence expenditure. Indeed, he \nthreatened that if this happened the United States would have \nto 'reconsider its bilateral arrangements' in areas such as commu\u00ad\nnications intelligence, and also on assistance in respect of nuclear \nweapons, including improvements to Britain's Polaris missiles. \nHe emphasised that he was conveying the attitude of the US \ngovernment as a whole.51 When Schlesinger visited London on \n24 September he was given renewed assurances that Britain \nhad halted any plans for withdrawal from Cyprus which had \n'impactions for US defence facilities there'. He also took the \nopportunity to emphasise the 'crucial importance' of American \nbase expansion on the British island of Diego Garcia in the \nIndian Ocean. 52 \nLondon and Washington continued to think about sigint on \nCyprus, pondering how to meet their shared intelligence-gath\u00ad\nering needs in the most economical way.53 In February 1977 Dr \nDavid Owen, who had taken over as Foreign Secretary under \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 333 \nthe Callaghan government, spoke with Clark Clifford, American \nSpecial Emissary to the eastern Mediterranean, who was taking \nthe lead on Cyprus. Clifford had recently been on a tour of the \nregion, and conferred with Owen in London on his way home. \nOn intelligence, Owen wanted to put on the record Britain's \n'deep gratitude for the privileged treatment they had received \nfrom the US in this field'. He then explained that while Britain \nhad kept the Cyprus bases because of their immense value to \n'the joint intelligence effort' of the two countries, the presence \nthere was expensive, and so remained 'a natural target for cuts'. \nHe added, 'We had intended in 1974 to withdraw from the \nSBAs, but had decided not to do so in response to an American \nrequest to remain.' However, Britain's finances were in a parlous \nstate, and the question needed to be looked at again. In short, \nthe British needed further subsidies. Clifford admitted that, while \nthe intelligence from Cyprus was 'not unique', with America's \nThrkish bases out of action it was 'very useful at present'. He \nasked exactly how much the Cyprus bases were costing, and \nafter a little thought offered the prospect of 'some economic \narrangement'. Owen was visibly cheered. 54 \nBritain and the United States were now a rather odd couple. \nDuring the early 1970s their alliance relationship had suffered \na number of vexations. The Americans had been disconcerted \nby Britain's irritating shift towards Europe, while Washington \nhad alarmed London with its tendency to act unilaterally, espe\u00ad\ncially in the Middle East. Yet for that very reason the British \nwere determined to try to preserve the intelligence connection. \nDerek Tonkin, who looked after intelligence coordination at the \nForeign Office, put this rather well, explaining that because of \nthese political tensions 'The intelligence exchange with the \nAmericans is perhaps the last bastion of the \"special relation\u00ad\nship\".' Moreover, he added, for the British the intelligence rela\u00ad\ntionship was now as much about watching Washington as about \nwatching the rest of the world.55 \nDespite their growing political differences, in the late 1970s \nBritain and America shared many practical problems in the \n334 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nrealm of sigint. Both NSA and GCHQ suffered deep cuts in their \nbudgets. On 13 July 1976, Joe Hooper, the Cabinet Office \nIntelligence Coordinator, briefed the British Chiefs of Staff on \nthe impact of the cuts. Intelligence spending was scheduled to \nfall by 10 per cent over a period of four years, and Hooper \nwarned that any further reduction would mean both losses of \nintelligence on targets of the highest priority and 'serious risk \nto US/UK relations both in intelligence and other fields'. The \nChiefs of Staff, led by Michael Carver, responded that Britain \n'above all should preserve its special intelligence relationship \nwith the US'.56 However, not everything was gloomy. Hooper \nargued that Britain should take every opportunity to gather \nintelligence from Cyprus, capitalising on the Americans' loss of \ntheir facilities in Turkey and the continuing volatility of the \nMiddle East.57 \nThe dramatic events in Turkey and Cyprus illustrated another \nserious problem shared by Britain and the USA, namely the \nshrinking pattern of bases in the Third World. Whether they \nwere owned by the British or the Americans, overseas bases \nwere a perennial source of conflict with nationalist politicians. \nBack in May 1964 the US National Security Council had \nreviewed the problem of 'politically unstable or unreliable coun\u00ad\ntries' in which the Americans had intelligence facilities. The list \nwas long, and included Cyprus, Greece, Turkey, Ethiopia, Libya, \nKenya, Morocco, India and Pakistan. 58 However, in the Indian \nOcean the British seemed to have come up with a novel plan \nto sidestep these problems by seeking to create an Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican base in a country without any indigenous people. \nBritain persuaded Mauritius and the Seychelles to detach a string \nof small islands in order to create a new sovereign area to be \ncalled the British Indian Ocean Territories, or 'BlOT'. The fly in \nthe ointment was that in reality there was a small indigenous \npopUlation, so the plan called for their enforced removal to \nMauritius. What had seemed like a good idea quickly turned \ninto a source of grave embarrassment.59 \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 335 \nThe main focus was the tiny island of Diego Garcia. The \nPentagon had made its first request for a possible communica\u00ad\ntion station there in August 1963.60 An agreement was reached \nat the end of December 1966 and a station was built in late \n1970. The original intention was that Britain would meet the \ncost of resettling the island's inhabitants and 'buying the agree\u00ad\nment of Mauritius and the Seychelles', while the Americans \nwould pay for the installations. However, as time went on it \nbecame clear that the 'sweetener' demanded by Mauritius and \nthe Seychelles to give up the islands was larger than expected \n-in the region of \u00a310 million. Ministers decided that Washington \nshould contribute to this, and American defence officials reluc\u00ad\ntantly agreed, on condition that this neocolonial activity could \nbe hidden. The arrangement was carried out secretly, by \ndeducting the American contribution from money that Britain \nowed for buying Polaris missiles.6! By the following year a full \nfinancial agreement had been drawn up, stating that the United \nStates would 'forgo the R&D surcharge to the extent of $14 \nmillion'.62 American defence officials knew that Congress would \nnot approve of America subsidising the 'separation of the Chagos \narchipelago' to create a new British colony. Indeed, British \nTreasury officials seemed to enjoy the discomfort of their allies \nand noted, 'There is plenty of reason for embarrassment.'63 If \nanyone asked whether there had been any American financial \ncontribution they were to say that 'no payment had been made \nby the US Government'.64 In April 1967, Richard Sykes of the \nForeign Office noted that 'in view of the extreme delicacy of \nthis subject' the circulation of papers was being kept to the \nabsolute minimum. Nevertheless, the Americans were increas\u00ad\ningly nervous about telling what was 'frankly an outright lie' .65 \nAlmost as soon as the communications facility had been built \non Diego Garcia, the Americans were requesting further expan\u00ad\nsion. This was linked to an earlier imperial sigint episode in East \nAfrica. During the Second World War the British had given \nAmerica permission to build a sigint station at Kagnew in \n336 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nEthiopia. By March 1951 there were over 1,312 staff there, \nproviding what NSA's Director, General Ralph Canine, described \nas 'unique and profitable intercept coverage'.66 Some of the \nwork at Kagnew was focllsed on the Soviets, but the base also \ncollected manual Morse from much of Africa and the Middle \nEast. This was especially valuable during the Congo crisis of \n1960, when the different factions fought for control over the \nprovince of Katanga, and the US Ambassador to the United \nNations later sent a letter of commendation to the commander \nof the Kagnew station for his excellent support to the UN \nmission, provided through intercepts. Most of the automatic \nhigh-speed Morse intercepted was commercial, and some of it \nrelated to Middle East oil deals. At its most active period \nKagnew's vast antennae farms sprawled over some 3,400 acres, \nand its five thousand personnel had all the facilities of a small \ntown, including tennis courts and swimming pools. However, \nby 1969 this ideal spot for sigint collection was threatened by \ngrowing fighting between the Ethiopian military, which was \nsupported by the Americans, and the rebel Eritrean Liberation \nFront, backed by Syria and the Soviet Union.67 By 1972 there \nwere only nine hundred personnel, and by 1974 Kagnew was \nsimply a relay station for nuclear submarine communications, \nwith a staff of little over a hundred. 1Wo kidnapping episodes \nin 1975 helped accelerate its final closure in 1977.68 \nIn June 1973 American officials in London explained to the \nBritish that they had been forced 'to reduce certain activities \nconducted by the US Army at Kagnew Station, Asmara', and \nthe most practical way of compensating for this would be the \nenlargement of the station on Diego Garcia. This would restore \n'coverage in Gulf of Oman, Arabian Sea and Western Indian \nOcean, where Kagnew phase-out would have caused temporary \ndegradation' to signals intelligence operations.69 The British were \ntaken aback at this 'very considerable' expansion of the facili\u00ad\nties.70 The cost of Diego Garcia now doubled. Part of the increased \nexpenditure was for a sigint system designed to track Soviet \nsubmarines. The American trump card was ongoing support for \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 337 \nBritain's own nuclear strategic submarines: Kissinger and \nSchlesinger did not hesitate to link Diego Garcia to ongoing \ndiscussions about the successor to the Polaris system that formed \nthe core of the British nuclear deterrent. Kissinger specifically \nreferred to a recent message from Heath to Nixon enquiring \nabout this matter, adding that' A favourable reply on Diego Garcia \nwould be very welcome and useful in the context of your \nmessage.'7l In fact the British Ambassador to Washington, Rowley \nCromer, had already signalled to the Americans that the expan\u00ad\nsion of Diego Garcia would be conditional on 'US willingness to \nassist Britain to carry through its Super Antelope program aimed \nat modernising and upgrading its Polaris submarine force'. Who \narticulated this deal first is unclear, but both sides saw it as a \nquid pro quO.72 \nThe deal almost came unstuck because of the confrontation \nabout intelligence and bases between Heath and Kissinger in \nlate 1973. The hot question was whether the Americans would \nbe given what they called 'unrestricted access' to the base at \nDiego Garcia in a crisis.73 Having seen Heath restrict access to \nbases in both Cypms and Britain during the Yom Kippur War \nof October 1973, Washington was not about to make the same \nmistake again. But Heath wanted precisely these sorts of restric\u00ad\ntions on Diego Garcia. On 10 January 1974 Sir John Hunt \nwarned Heath, 'This will not be easy.'74 Three weeks later it \nwas a hapless Hunt who was sent on a special mission to the \nWhite House to find an agreed formula. On 30 January he and \nKissinger met at the White House with their officials. Kissinger, \nwho clearly had the confrontations with Heath over intelli\u00ad\ngence flights in October 1973 fresh in his mind, explained that \nthey might well be 'confronted with the same sort of differ\u00ad\nences between our two Governments as there had been at the \ntime of the Middle East War'. If Heath refused access in some \nfuture crisis, the Diego Garcia facilities on which America would \nhave spent many millions would be 'useless'. Britain 'had to \nbe realistic'. 75 \nWith Hunt due to fly back to London within hours, he met \n338 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nKissinger privately to try to resolve the deadlock. Their solu\u00ad\ntion was a remarkable one. Publicly, the position would be a \n'joint decision' on the use of the bases in a crisis, seemingly \nretaining the British veto. However, behind the scenes there \nwould be a highly secret exchange of letters between Heath and \nNixon that effectively changed this to mere consultation. Sure \nenough, on 5 February Heath wrote a carefully crafted letter \nassuring Nixon of this 'on a very personal basis'. 'These under\u00ad\nstandings are agreeable to me,' replied Nixon.76 The British \nEmbassy assured London that the exchange was being handled \n'very restrictively indeed in the White House'.77 \nThe difficulties that would dog Diego Garcia for years had \nonly just begun. In September 1975 Harold Wilson was told by \nhis officials that there were continuing problems with the indige\u00ad\nnous population. 'Our real difficulty,' they admitted, 'arises from \nthe failure of the Mauritius Government to use the money we \ngave them to resettle those evacuated from Diego Garcia.' \nMauritius had been paid over \u00a312 million, but this money had \nseemingly disappeared. Officials said that they were doing what \nthey could to persuade the Mauritian government to meet their \nresponsibilities, but they had been 'dragging their feet'.78 \nMeanwhile, Diego Garcia became a byword for misrule, and a \npoint of transatlantic friction. In 1981 the State Department \ncomplained that the local Royal Navy contingent that was \nsupposed to keep order on the island was 'unable to cope with \nspreading lawlessness'. It noted, 'the drug problem is out of \nhand', and that recently 'rampaging construction workers and \nsailors reportedly have smashed up the British Club'.79 \nIn their different ways, events in Turkey, Cyprus and Diego Garcia \nare important examples of how the ruthless requirement for \nsignals intelligence bases has impacted on the wider fabric of the \ninternational system. On Diego Garcia the effect was especially \nstark, translating into a Canute-like resistance to the end of empire \nand the cruel deportation of an island population. This was surely \none of the more dismal episodes in recent British history. Many \nTURMOIL ON CYPRUS 339 \nof the deportees were second-or third-generation islanders, for \nwhom Diego Garda was their rightful home. Ahead lay years of \nlegal battles as the indigenous islanders attempted -unsuccess\u00ad\nfully -to end their forced resettlement and achieve the right to \nreturn.80 When the original secret deal over Diego Garda was \ndone, Sir Paul Gore Booth, the Permanent Under-Secretary at \nthe Foreign Office, had expressed the British attitude frankly: 'We \nmust surely be very tough about this. The object of the exerdse \nis to get some rocks which will remain ours. There will be no \nindigenous people except the seagulls .. .'81 \n18 \nUnmasking GCHQ: The ABC Trial \nWe've been to MI5, MI6, Scotland Yard, Parliament and many \nmore. Now we're going where much of the dirty work goes on -\nCHELTENHAM! \nABC trial campaign newsletter, 27 May 19781 \nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, signals intelligence was \nchanging fast. The big players were discovering a whole new \nworld of super-secret interception which provided a different \nsort of signals intelligence. This new source was telephone calls. \nAs we have already seen, tapping telephones was hardly new, \nand had boomed in the 1950s in response to problems with \nreading high-grade codes. However, telephone calls were now \nincreasingly being routed away from old-fashioned cables, which \nwere hard to intercept, especially within secure states like the \nSoviet Union, and being carried by the more modern means of \nradio links, using microwave towers and satellites. This was a \nvastly more efficient system of communication, especially for \nlong-distance or international calls. One of the side-effects was \nthat conversations now spilled freely into the ether, making the \npossibilities for interception almost limitless. The best thing about \nthis new source was that the material was often not encrypted \nso it provided a veritable fountain of intelligence virtually for \nfree. A sigint revolution was just around the corner. \nThe downside of these new developments was that they \nproduced inconceivable volumes of material. Computers were \nno longer needed just for breaking codes, but also for combing \nthrough the intelligence, storing it and distributing it to \ncustomers. The volume of sigint that was being collected was \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 341 \ntoo large for any human to read. Moreover, the vast complexes \nof domes and satellite dishes that now accompanied the suppos\u00ad\nedly super-secret intelligence activities of NSA and GCHQ meant \nthat they were more and more visible. Sooner rather than later, \nan enterprising investigative journalist was bound to point to \nthese surreal installations and shout the dreaded words 'Signals \nintelligence.' It is amazing that in the mid-1970s GCHQ was \nstill managing to pass itself off as a glorified communications \nrelay station, hiding its real activities from public view. \nAnonymity would not last much longer. \nWhat we now recognise as the first glimmerings of a global \ntelecommunications revolution seemed to be in the interests of \nthe world's major sigint agencies. A fascinating example of this \nwas an operation carried out jointly by the British and Americans \nin 1969. NSA was gathering a great deal of intelligence from \ntelephone calls between Fidel Castro's Cuba and the many Cuban \nexiles living in Florida. Using sigint ships, it was also possible \nto intercept some calls from Havana to other parts of Cuba. This \nwas of some importance, since an elaborate game of cat and \nmouse was being plc.yed between the CIA and the Cuban intel\u00ad\nligence service among the exile communities of Florida. Most \nof the calls were carried on a radio network called a tropos\u00ad\npheric scatter system, owned by the Radio Corporation of Cuba, \nwhich also carried teletype traffic. The Radio Corporation of \nCuba was a subsidiary of the American telecommunications \ngiant ITT which had been gleefully nationalised by Castro when \nhe came to power in 1959, along with all other American busi\u00ad\nnesses on the island. The radio installation in Cuba was in need \nof a substantial upgrade, requiring new condensers and tran\u00ad\nsistors, leading the Americans to fear that the link would cease \nto function, and the telephone calls would be sent by a different \nroute, perhaps by cable, which was much harder to intercept. \nBecause America maintained a strict economic blockade of \nCuba, it needed to subvert its own embargo in order for the \nnecessary material to reach the island -besides which, if it came \ndirect from America, the uncharacteristic generosity would alert \n342 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nthe Cubans to the interception. The Americans turned to Britain, \nwhich had no embargo on Cuba, explaining that 'The intelli\u00ad\ngence community regards the maintenance of the link as being \nof considerable importance. '2 The British, for their part, \nwelcomed the opportunity of placing the Americans in their \ndebt by participating in a covert operation.3 The materials were \nduly shipped to Britain, and then re-exported. NSA ensured \nthat the suppliers were indemnified against legal action for \nbreaking the embargo, while ITT used its subsidiary in Britain, \nStandard Telegraph & Cable Ltd, as a cover to make the delivery. \nOne of GCHQ's largest ventures into the world of vacuuming \nup telephone calls was launched in Cornwall in 1967. At \nGoonhilly Downs on the Lizard peninsula there was a satellite \nreceiving station for one of the world's first commercial commu\u00ad\nnications satellites, Intelsat. Intelsat was a booming commercial \nventure that carried a growing proportion of the world's private \ncommunications, and was partly responsible for the explosion \nof international telephone calls. The system grew from 240 chan\u00ad\nnels when it opened in 1964 to thirty thousand in 1983.4 \nDisplaying a certain amount of barefaced cheek, GCHQ built a \nduplicate receiving station about sixty miles down the road, \nnear the village of Morwenstow, on the site of a former RAF \nwartime airfield. Here it could scoop up the same telephone \ntraffic by simply collecting the 'spillage' as commercial satellites \nbeamed messages down to earth. This station, with its distinc\u00ad\ntive domes and satellite dishes littered along the Cornish cliff tops, \nwas initially called CSO Morwenstow, and later changed its \nname to GCHQ Bude. Morwenstow was a classic Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican intelligence venture. NSA paid for most of the infra\u00ad\nstructure and the technology, while GCHQ contributed the land \nand paid for the staff and running costs. The massive flow of \nintelligence it received was shared and processed jointly.5 \nIn 1969 GCHQ was working hard to develop revolutionary \nnew systems for analysing and distributing the huge volume of \nintelligence intercepts, with computers being used to search for \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 343 \nkeywords that indicated subjects of interest. On 3 March Joe \nHooper, the Director of GCHQ, explained to Dick White, the \nCabinet Office Intelligence Coordinator, that the sigint collected \nat Bude would shortly be fed into a computer database that \nwould be used by Britain and the USA to select product. The \nmain challenge was restricting access to information at the right \nlevel to people with the right clearances. This, Hooper explained, \ninvolved 'a complicated system of ligating\" in the computer \nprogrammes'. This was the first British venture with secure \nmulti-level access computer systems for delivering intelligence.6 \nGCHQ was at the cutting edge of what would eventually be \na transformative technology for all kinds of researchers. In the \npast, anyone who wanted to look at large volumes of news\u00ad\npapers would have to trawl laboriously through them physi\u00ad\ncally. The time and effort involved meant that they could focus \non only a few chosen titles. Today, accessing the world's press \nis effortless and can be done at the click of a mouse, because \nit is available electronically. The downside, again, is 'too much \ninformation'. Nobody can read all the world's press, so modern \nresearchers use word -search facilities like Google Alert. In exactly \nthe same way, NSA and GCHQ could not listen in to the entire \nworld's satellite telephone calls, telexes and faxes. So they fed \nall the material into computers and built a top-secret equiva\u00ad\nlent of Google Alert, constructing computers that combed the \ntraffic for keywords and predesignated phrases. This system was \ncalled 'Dictionary'. 7 \nEach new form of interception presents fresh legal challenges. \nGCHQ's collection operation at Bude took three forms. At its \nmost expansive it involved baseband trawling, which meant \nmoving through large volumes of traffic from each country that \nwas being monitored to find out whether material of interest \nwas passing through particular channels. Next, there was a \nsystem that allowed the interception of all the traffic from a \nparticular telephone dialling code, in other words perhaps one \nsection of a city. Thirdly, there was the monitoring of specific \ntelephone numbers. Initially, the GCHQ staff were uncertain \n344 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nabout the legality of some of the broadband trawling, which \nincluded some British channels. For reasons that are not entirely \nclear, managers eventually persuaded them that it was not a \nlegal issue. Allegedly, specific British numbers were targeted, \nand these were known as 'P-Numbers'. GCHQ was already \nbeginning to encounter what we now recognise as one of the \nkey characteristics of globalisation -the mixing up of what is \ninside and outside the nation state. Previously there had been \na clear dividing line between domestic and international commu\u00ad\nnications, which made for useful legal distinctions in the realm \nof interception. During the 1970s these distinctions were begin\u00ad\nning to break down.s \nEven telephone messages that were not carried by satellite \nwere vulnerable, because they were increasingly being beamed \nbetween microwave radio towers. The beams travelled in a \nstraight line, eventually spilling out into space because of the \ncurvature of the earth. This led to yet another collection revo\u00ad\nlution, since the Americans discovered that much of this tele\u00ad\nphone traffic was vulnerable to interception by a new generation \nof sigint satellites. By the 1970s these were scooping enormous \namounts of communications from space. One of the first major \ndividends was an improved ability to listen in to Moscow. NSA \nbegan to listen in to telephone calls in the Soviet capital, and \nalso to the radio messages of taxi drivers and the Zillimousines \nused by the Politburo. The drivers gossiped constantly about \ntheir passengers, revealing fascinating insights into life amongst \nRussia's elite. Alas, this was revealed publicly in the Washington \nPost in September 1971 by the renegade American journalist \nJack Anderson.9 \nThe ability to listen in to telephone calls carried by radio waves \nmeant a radical shift in GCHQ's business all around the world. \nIn August 1974, British officials noted with delight that Syrian \ncommunications security was unsophisticated, and that 'In some \nquarters the open telephone is treated as if it were secure.'IO \nGCHQ also had to assist friends and allies to protect them against \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 345 \nthe new sigint techniques: in Oman, for example, speech secu\u00ad\nrity equipment was installed. I I The Joint Intelligence Committee \nalso began to rethink Britain's intelligence targets in Europe \nbecause of this telephone sigint bonanza, which it coyly referred \nto as 'advances in intelligence-gathering by technical means' Y \nBy 1973, new subjects had joined Russia as 'Priority One'. These \nincluded the 'Stability of the UK', which required intelligence \nto look inwards. Specific new targets included the IRA and \nextremist organisations within Britain. The other new priority, \nwhich had been growing fast since the 1960s, was Western \nEurope. Intelligence on West Germany was now far more valu\u00ad\nable than intelligence on East Germany. Britain needed to know \nwhat Bonn thought about Britain's diplomatic recognition of \nEast Germany, Britain's entry into the Common Market and \nmajor arms deals such as the new NATO Tornado Multi-Role \nCombat Aircraft that would eventually equip the air forces of \nBritain, West Germany and Italy. Britain's senior policy-makers \nalso wanted better support for the sort of guerrilla wars that \nhad flared in Cyprus, Aden and Oman during the 1960s and \n1970s.13 \nNSA was already experimenting with sophisticated satellites \nthat would revolutionise sigint activity by focusing on signals \nthat were above the high-frequency range.14 On 19 July 1970 \nAmerica launched its first operational Ryolite satellites, which \nstayed broadly in the same place above the earth, requiring \nground stations in specific locations to receive the voluminous \nsigint that they beamed down.15 These stations were constructed \nat Pine Gap in Australia and at Menwith Hill near Harrogate in \nYorkshire. Menwith Hill had been a field collection station for \nthe US Army Security Agency since the 1950s, but was later \ntaken over and run directly by NSA. By the 1970s it had been \nvastly expanded, and had become the largest American over\u00ad\nseas intelligence base in the world. Its dozens of space-age \ndomes, each of which hid a satellite dish, looked somewhat \nincongruous amongst the grazing cattle of the Yorkshire coun\u00ad\ntryside. Now, its main purpose was to download torrents of \n346 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nsigint collected by the new generations of American sigint satel\u00ad\nlites. About 15 per cent of this 'overhead' material was diverted \nto Cheltenham, where a new super-secret section of GCHQ's \nSoviet Section (J Division) -code-named J -Operations or \n'J-Ops' -was set up to handle this new influx of sigint.16 \nMuch of the popular anxiety about the vast American ground \nstation at Menwith Hill, nominally disguised as an RAF station, \nhas focused on its connection to the nearby Hunters Stones Post \nOffice Tower, which forms part of the British microwave tele\u00ad\nphone network. For years, campaigners protesting against the \nAmerican base insisted that this allowed NSA to eavesdrop on \nBritish domestic communications. This was fervently denied by \nAlbert Braeuninger, the base commander in the early 1980s, \nwho insisted that NSA was merely a customer of British Telecom. \nThis statement was correct, but it actually hid a different secret. \nMuch of the product from the Ryolite satellites was being routed \nover this microwave network to GCHQ's secretive J-Ops section, \nwhere it was processed locally on behalf of NSA. This indicated \nan important change in status for GCHQ in the late 1970s and \n1980s, since it incrf'asingly became part of the processing system \nfor what NSA collected.17 \nNSA's new satellites were actually a major problem for the \nAmericans by the late 1970s. The 'take' from these sources was \nenormous and still growing, yet funding for NSA was being reduced \nas a result of post-Vietnam defence budget cuts. NSA's own histo\u00ad\nrian, Robert Johnson, notes: 'Scarce resources meant reliance on \noutside help. As the budget got slimmer, NSA turned increasingly \nto the help that foreigners could provide. This trend accelerated \nin the 1970s to a greater degree than at any time in post-World \nWar II cryptological history: The collaboration between GCHQ \nand NSA was 'almost total', and at 'each bend in the road, NSA \nmade the consdous dedsion to remain engaged'. Indeed, these \ndevelopment5, which also involved other friendly countries, were \nso important that NSA appointed a 'Third Party Manager' to look \nafter the increasingly complex relationship with allies.18 \n* * * \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 347 \nThe sigint satellite revolution was an unsettling experience \nfor GCHQ. Although the British were 'in' on developments \nsuch as Bude and Menwith Hill, they were not 'of' them, \nsince they had no satellites of their own. The golden age of \nhigh-frequency ground-based interception by manual opera\u00ad\ntors sitting in nissen huts was drawing to a close. Major over\u00ad\nseas sigint sites, such as Cyprus, were still vital, especially for \nmissile surveillance. However, broadly speaking, the satellite \nrevolution, together with the possibilities of remote collec\u00ad\ntion, was gradually downgrading the value of GCHQ's exotic \nreal estate. Meanwhile, the advent of satellites created a new \nsuper-club of sigint powers, of which there were only two \nmembers, America and Russia. It was a club that GCHQ ached \nto join. \nIn one area, GCHQ was joining the satellite club. This was \nthe field of communications satellites for forwarding sigint from \ncollection stations to GCHQ, and for communicating with NSA. \nIn the early 1950s, communications between GCHQ and NSA \nwere poor, due to insufficient cables and inadequate clear radio \nfrequencies.19 In 19')6, the transatlantic channels between the \ntwo agencies were suffering outages of over four hours a day.20 \nThe main worry was enemy disruption in any future conflict. \nA secret study had concluded that the Soviets were likely to try \na range of sabotage tactics in war, among the easiest of which \nwas trawling up cables and cutting them. Transatlantic cables \nwere at 'trawl depth' for long stretches, and the Soviets were \nexpected to deploy specially modified nuclear submarines for \nthe task. Other options were available, including the use of KGB \nagents to place 'clandestine, low-powered jammers' close to the \nrelay stations.21 By the 1970s Britain would be overcoming some \nof these problems with its own military communications satel\u00ad\nlite, called 'Skynet'. Skynet also provided secure encrypted \nspeech facilities to the military wherever a Skynet terminal \nexisted. The first Skynet satellite was expected in 1969, followed \nby a progressive build-up of further satellites and ground termi\u00ad\nnals. In obscure locations such as Bahrain, GCHQ was the largest \n348 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nSkynet user. On Cyprus it required no fewer than eight chan\u00ad\nnels, and was responsible for more than 80 per cent of the traffic \ncoming back to Britain. Much of this was data on Soviet missiles \nfrom Project Sandra and Project Cobra Shoe.22 \nSkynet was a major scientific achievement, and represented \nBritain's first significant step into space. The launch of the satel\u00ad\nlite was regarded as a cause for national celebration. In November \n1969 the RAF was invited onto the BBC children's programme \nBlue Peter to display a mock-up of the satellite which was admired \nby the presenters Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter \nPurves. The programme also described Britain's new satellite \ncontrol centre at RAF Oakhanger. However, no public mention \nwas made on Blue Peter, or indeed anywhere, of Skynet's biggest \nsingle customer, namely GCHQ.23 \nThe capacity provided by Skynet was enormous, yet the plan\u00ad\nners noted that it was 'adequate for all users of data except \nGCHQ'. The unimaginably huge amount of intelligence it was \nsharing with its main partners meant that GCHQ still required \nits own dedicated cables to NSA, the Canadian CBNRC and the \nAustralian DSD.24 By February 1972, the Cabinet Office was \nbeginning to look at the next generation of Skynet satellites \nand its alternatives, at a cost of about \u00a350 million. Again, the \nbiggest customer was GCHQ.25 All of its allies, especially the \nCIA, were now 'satellite-conscious'.26 GCHQ pressed for closer \nintegration with the United States, arguing for an off-the-shelf \nAmerican Type-777 satellite, which was hardened to withstand \nsome of the effects of a nuclear explosion. However, govern\u00ad\nment Ministers were desperate to maintain a British national \nspace programme, so they chose Skynet III.27 \nPreserving UK national reserves of knowledge and expertise \nwas something that GCHQ touched on in many ways. For \nexample, it had long helped to steer policy on the teaching of \nlanguages like Chinese in British universities.28 More impor\u00ad\ntantly, it had a role in the development of British computing. \nCode-breaking had driven important breakthroughs in \ncomputing both during and after the Second World War, led by \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 349 \nluminary figures such as Alan Turing. The most famous example \nis 'Colossus', which was used to attack 'Tunny', the encyphered \nteleprinter used by the German High Command. Ten examples \nof Colossus II were in operation by the end of the war. Other \nearly computers called 'Robinson' and' Aquarius' were no less \ninnovative. Both Robinson and Colossus were designed and \nbuilt at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill by the \ncelebrated Tommy Flowers, now recognised as one of the most \nenterprising scientists Britain produced during the war. At the \nend of the war a number of engineers moved from Dollis Hill \nand the British Tabulating Machine Company at Letchworth to \njoin GCHQ at nearby Eastcote.29 \nColossus marched on into the early Cold War period. The last \ntwo Colossus II machines were assembled at Eastcote rather \nthan Bletchley, and code-named 'Blue' and 'Red'. These were \nrebuilt between 1948 and 1951, before being taken to \nCheltenham in 1953 and employed until 1961. Also using the \nColossus circuits were four new Robinson machines that were \ninstalled at Eastcote. These were eventually overtaken by \n'Colorob', a new specialist machine developed with help from \nthe defence electronics firm Ferranti and Manchester University. \nThe most important GCHQ computer development was \n'Oedipus', the first machine to exploit high-speed storage. Begun \nin 1951, Oedipus could store ten thousand fifteen-character \nphrases on its drum memory, an achievement far ahead of its \ntime.3D The significance of Oedipus was that it was a powerful \nrapid-character-comparison machine with a capability greatly \nexceeding that of any general stored programme machine avail\u00ad\nable commercially in the 1950s and 1960s. Much of this elab\u00ad\norate technology was devoted to unsuccessful attacks on \nhigh-grade Soviet diplomatic cyphers.31 \nHowever, GCHQ's impact on computer development was not \nas great as that of NSA. Although NSA pursued a 'policy of \nanonymity', it was nevertheless later able to claim a string of \nvery considerable computer firsts. Typically, the' Atlas 1', deliv\u00ad\nered to NSA in December 1950, was the first parallel electronic \n350 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \ncomputer with a drum memory. Its successor, 'Atlas 2', deliv\u00ad\nered in December 1953, was the first core memory computer. \nIn March 1958 NSA received the first computer that relied wholly \non transistors, called 'Solo', which became the model for many \nof Phiko's later commercial designs. In February 1962 it took \ndelivery of 'Harvest', the first large computer with a completely \nautomated tape library. Harvest strongly influenced the design \nof the IBM System 360, a breakthrough machine which was a \nfamiliar sight in GCHQ's vast computer hall by the late 1960s.32 \nThe later IBM-700 series was soon the mainstay of core oper\u00ad\nations at NSA and GCHQ. By 1968 Marshall Carter, NSA's \nDirector, could boast that he had over a hundred computers \noccupying almost five acres of floor space.33 \nIn 1977 GCHQ took delivery of the first of its advanced \nAmerican-built Cray super-computers. A super-computer breaks \na problem down into many tasks that can all be done at the \nsame time. By using different parts of its brain in parallel it can \nundertake vast calculations unbelievably quickly. The main appli\u00ad\ncations are code-breaking, designing nuclear weapons and \nweather forecasting. At this time the world of super-computers \nwas led by Seymour Cray, and the first production model rolled \nout of his company's factory at Chippewa Falls, Minnesota in \nthe spring of 1976. This was delivered to NSA, while the second \nwent to NSA's mathematical think tank at Princeton University.34 \nRemarkably, a Cray machine for Cheltenham was already under \nconstruction, and was shipped across the Atlantic the following \nyear. In the autumn of 1976 the impending arrival of the Cray \ndrove some of the construction work at GCHQ's Benhall site, \nincluding a new building for the computer staff -known as X \nDivision -together with a new Special Compartmentalised \nIntelligence Facility with reinforced strongrooms to hold their \ndocuments.35 The new Cray machine was so powerful that it \nrequired elaborate cooling, and much of the redevelopment at \nCheltenham was in order to provide special ventilation and a \nsupply of 'chilled water direct to computers'. 36 All this reflected \na strategic decision by NSA to place more emphasis on super-\nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 351 \ncomputing, a decision which was followed by GCHQ.37 They \nwere soon rewarded, for in 1976 the West recovered the long\u00ad\nlost ability to read some high-level Soviet communications, \nincluding telegrams between Moscow and the Soviet Embassy \nin Washington.38 \nGCHQ was also making an important transition from using \ncomputers just for cryptanalysis to using them for everything, \nincluding sending sigint to customers. This was the beginning \nof a revolutionary breakthrough. As early as August 1967, \nForeign Office planners remarked, 'We hope to get proposals \nshortly from G.C.H.Q. in Cheltenham which would provide \nmethods of random access by desk officers to the computer \nitself.' GCHQ hoped that this would provide something like near \nreal-time distribution of its precious sigint product to users in \nWhitehall. In the 1970s the old 'blue jacket' files full of sigint \nintercepts started to disappear, and online access for policy\u00ad\nmakers slowly began to take over.39 Computers were also being \nused widely inside GCHQ. In 1967, Ken Sly, who had \ncommanded the sigint unit at Hong Kong, took over from \nNicodemus Doniach as head of a GCHQ branch called the Joint \nTechnical Language Service, a group of thirty highly qualified \nlinguists who not only undertook translations, but also compiled \nmaterial ranging from dictionaries of Soviet military terms to \nhandbooks of Arab names. When Sly took over they were \nworking from a vast wall of index cards thirty yards long. He \nbegan a determined programme of computerisation, so this vast \nbody of knowledge gradually became available to everyone in \nGCHQ.40 \nThis change was of the first importance. GCHQ could see that \ncomputers were the shape of the future, and wanted to use \nthem to improve every stage of the intelligence process. \nHowever, the gap between ambition and reality was huge. In \n1973 GCHQ was still at the basic stage of trying to get lists of \nits previous files onto computer, moving away from card indexes. \nThe ambition was to get enough information about the files \ninto the system to allow for keyword searching. However, there \n352 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwas a mountain of files, and Gerry Bontoft, who presided over \nrecords, needed more staff and was battling a freeze on recruit\u00ad\nment.4! GCHQ also kept personnel files for longer than most \nother departments in case they were needed for security \nenquiriesY As a result, it was now bulging with records. Its \nRegistry held a massive twenty-three thousand shelf feet of \nrecords generated by GCHQ's twenty different divisions, and \nwas adding four thousand files every yearY The Registry \npredicted that it would hit a quarter of a million files by the \nyear 2000. Matters were made worse by the determination of \neach division to keep its own over-stuffed registry. Managers \nwanted to destroy older sigint records received from US and \nCommonwealth allies, but the divisions resisted, pointing out \nthat the United States in particular could not be relied upon to \nkeep complete sets of its own reports.44 \nGCHQ did at least have good American-made IBM computers, \nwhereas other areas of government were continually under pres\u00ad\nsure to take underperforming machines from the ailing British \ncomputer industry. The agency could always play the trump \ncard of Anglo-American compatibility. By the mid-1960s, IBM \nwas in a position that British officials described as an 'oligopoly', \nenjoying three quarters of the world's computer market and \nspending \u00a330 million a year on research and development. It \nrecovered these costs easily through production runs of thou\u00ad\nsands of machines. GCHQ bought IBM computers not only \nbecause of NSA compatibility, but because its machines were \ncutting edge.4s Nevertheless, GCHQ still had an impact on the \nBritish computing industry during the 1970s. This came largely \nin the form of one person, Teddy Poulden, who was lent by \nGCHQ to the Cabinet Office as an adviser. Poulden was, in many \nways, an unlikely figure for this role. He was a general sigint \nmanager rather than a computer specialist. He had begun his \ncareer helping to run the vast British naval sigint station on \nCeylon during the war, and his first post-war job had been to \nhead the new Australian sigint organisation. However, he then \nspent a couple of years as the liaison officer at NSA at a time \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 353 \nof increasing automation, and had learned to love computers. \nHe became Coordinator of Technical Services at GCHQ, working \nclosely with the computer section known as X Division. \nDick White, the go-ahead new Intelligence Coordinator in the \nCabinet Office, was another avid computer enthusiast. In February \n1969 he was chatting to Joe Hooper, the Director of GCHQ, about \nhow computers were transforming the world of intelligence. \nHooper happened to mention a new American system called \n'COINS' (Community On-line Intelligence System) that was \nintended to provide a shared database across the whole US intel\u00ad\nligence community. While was exdted by this idea, and asked \nhim for a detailed appraisal. Hooper rather relished giving White \nthe doleful story. Begun in 1965 as a presidential initiative by \nLyndon Johnson, after four years and vast expense it was still \nnot working. The idea was to allow all the different American \nintelligence agendes to access each other's computerised files, \ntogether with 'read-only' access for the Pentagon and the State \nDepartment. However, there were major difficulties with different \nfile formats and terminology. The committee set up to address \nthis had got nowhere, and was caught up in bitter bureaucratic \nwrangling.46 \nWhite was not deterred. By early 1970 he had persuaded the \nJoint Intelligence Committee to get busy in the area of new \ntechnology. Brian Stewart, Secretary of the JIC, created a joint \nteam on Automatic Data Processing which also comprised MIS, \nSIS, the Defence Intelligence Staff and the Foreign Office. Teddy \nPoulden from GCHQ was given the job of chairing it.47 GCHQ \nand NSA had just completed a shared computer project to stan\u00ad\ndardise the spelling of geographical locations in Russian.48 What \nGCHQ really thirsted for was progress on machine translation \nthat would do some of the jobs currently undertaken by linguists, \nbut so far this had failed on grounds of high costs and \ncomplexity.49 The Defence Intelligence Staff had looked at storing \nmore of its material on computer, but had been horrified by \nthe sheer labour required to keep such databases current. Despite \nthese disappointments, they all recognised that NSA's growing \n354 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nuse of ,=omputers for data storage meant this was the future. \n'Most Sigint end-product already contained simple machine \nsymbols' as a result of its journey through the communications \nsystem, and NSA already maintained 'an almost complete file \nof Sigint end-product for retrieval' on computer. In June 1971 \nPoulden was rightly predicting that these changes would spread \nthrough the entire Western intelligence community over the \nnext ten years.50 By 1974, Dick White's successors as Intelligence \nCoordinator would be looking to computers in a desperate effort \nto cut staff numbers in the face of swingeing cuts to the intel\u00ad\nligence and defence budgets.51 \nIn the early 1970s the public knew almost nothing about the \nbreathtaking achievements of high-tech espionage. Overhead, \nsatellites were collecting millions of telephone calls which were \nthen being word-searched by computers of mind-boggling \ncomplexity. Yet the British people were still not even aware of \nthe wartime achievements of Bletchley Park. Ultra and its \nconquest of the German Enigma machine were still shrouded \nin government secrecy. Indeed, the official histories of the Second \nWorld War had been artfully constructed to hide code-breaking \nand deception from public view. But in 1974 all was suddenly \nrevealed in a memoir called The Ultra Secret by Frederick \nWinterbotham, who had looked after the distribution of Ultra \nto operational commanders in the field. Those who had worked \nat Bletchley Park had taken their vows of secrecy very seri-\n0usly' and in some cases for thirty years had not told even their \nhusbands or wives what they had worked on during the war. \nNow they could speak about what they had done. 52 \nKim Philby was a major reason why the government even\u00ad\ntually chose not to oppose the publication of Winterbotham's \ntell-all memoir. Burke Trend, the Cabinet Secretary, hoped that \nthe revelations it contained would help restore the reputation \nof British intelligence, which had taken a battering in recent \nyears as a result of the vast publicity given to the defection of \nthe KGB moles who had burrowed deep inside the intelligence \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 355 \nservices. Philby's deliberately misleading memoir, published in \n1968, was especially damaging, and had prompted the govern\u00ad\nment to produce its own official history of intelligence, and even \nto release some wartime sigint records from Bletchley Park for \nuse by historians.53 Managing the public image of the intelli\u00ad\ngence community was entirely new territory for the authorities, \nwho now faced the nightmare task of screening top-secret files \nbefore they reached the Public Record Office at Kew. The archives \nfrom the Second World War were enormous, and weeding them \nto extract the specific bits of intelligence material that were still \ndeemed too sensitive for release was a Herculean task. However, \nofficials were spurred on by news that the Soviets were taking \na close interest in what was released. In July 1970 the Security \nDepartment of the Foreign Office warned that the Soviets had \nsent a researcher from Moscow to look through the newly \nreleased records at Kew, 'not merely from a historical point of \nview but also with an eye on current British government proce\u00ad\ndures'. Officials observed that 'Time spent in cleansing the record \nof intelligence ... is not spent in vain.'54 \nWhat the KGB had already managed to find out about current \nGCHQ activities had formed part of the deliberations over the \nrelease of wartime sigint records from Bletchley Park. 'The \nRussians in particular know of our sigint successes,' noted one \nofficial, adding that {he worst leaks had occurred because of \n'three defectors from NSA who were fully informed on Anglo/US \nsigint in the '50s and early '60s'. Primarily, this was a reference \nto the defection in 1960 of the American code-breakers William \nMartin and Bernon Mitchell, who had talked enthusiastically \nat a press conference in Moscow about the way in which the \nWest had collected and broken the diplomatic traffic of coun\u00ad\ntries like Egypt and Indonesia. The third NSA defector was Jack \nDunlap, who revealed a great deal about code-breaking to the \nSoviets in 1963. The British officials failed to mention their own \nsecurity problems with figures such as Douglas Britten.55 \nWhitehall and Washington were now badly out of step. \nTimorous figures from GCHQ had spent the early 1970s worrying \n356 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nover the protection of wartime secrets. Suddenly, in 1974, to \nthe horror of British officials, the Americans began to expose \ncurrent secrets. In Washington the secret state was in full retreat \nas the American psyche suffered the triple blows of Watergate, \nVietnam and the Oil Crisis. One of the manifestations of this \nnew self-questioning political climate was court decisions which \nupheld the rights of dissident intelligence officers to write their \nmemoirs. A CIA officer called Victor Marchetti had teamed up \nwith a diplomat to write one of the first revelatory accounts of \nthe CIA. The US government had demanded over two hundred \ndeletions, but the courts later reduced this to twenty-two. Britain \nwas alarmed. One of the joint operations revealed in the \nMarchetti book was the shared nature of Britain's massive sigint \nand radar complex on Cyprus. In April 1974 Harold Wilson had \njust begun his second administration, and his new Cabinet \nSecretary, John Hunt, warned him of a 'potential danger' to the \ncontinued operation of Sandra and Cobra Shoe, with their ability \nto look deep into Soviet airspace, since the Cypriots did not \nknow about American participation in these projects.56 \nThe following year, the British intelligence community was \nshocked to the core by Congressional inquiries into intelligence \nunder Senator Frank Church. The revelations included discus\u00ad\nsion of planned assassinations by the CIA. Richard Helms, who \nhad been Director of the CIA until 1973, confided his feelings \nto his friend the former Hut Six code-breaker Bill Bundy. Helms \nfelt he had 'maintained discipline' during his own tenure, but \nnow 'the dam had broken' and secrets of all kinds were spilling \nout. 57 British intelligence applied continuous pressure on the \nAmericans to avoid revelations about their joint operations. In \nearly April 1976 George Bush, the fourth new CIA Director in \nas many years, came to visit Harold Wilson. One of his purposes \nwas to reassure the British that the Americans had curbed the \nChurch Committee hearings, with their 'vociferous demand for \ngeneral disclosure of intelligence procedures'. British officials \nhoped that at last the pendulum had begun to swing back in \nfavour of secrecy. John Hunt asked Wilson to take the oppor-\nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 357 \ntunity ouring their discussions to reassure Bush about the high \nvalue Britain continued to place on the Anglo-American intel\u00ad\nligence relationship. Hunt added that this relationship was on \nthe up, because the Americans were under financial pressure \nand had lost listening stations in South-East Asia and in Turkey, \nmaking them more dependent on British help.58 \nHarold Wilson, now moving towards the end of his second \nterm as Prime Minister, was both fascinated and terrified by \nintelligence matters. Unlike his officials, he seemed to rather \nenjoy the revelations of the Church inquiry. Indeed, only a \nmonth before George Bush arrived at Downing Street, Wilson \nhad been visited by Frank Church, and spent longer chatting \nwith him than he did with Bush. Church explained the work\u00ad\nings of his Congressional inquiry at length, and Wilson responded \nthat he 'had always been assured that the CIA were not engaged \nin covert operations in this country', adding that he thought \nthis was '98 per cent true'. Church said that he had been given \nthe same assurance, and 'agreed with his qualification'. Wilson \nthen began to reveal some of his own espionage obsessions, \nespecially his fears about South African intelligence agents in \nBritain who were active in the cause of apartheid, explaining \nthat he thought both the CIA and the notorious South African \nsecret service (BOSS) were behind the recent recruitment of \nBritish mercenaries for service in the Angolan civil war. Wilson \nalso pressed Church on the possibility of the CIA having paid \nbribes to British companies. Church departed, assuring Wilson \nthat he would send him his findings on CIA activities in Chile.59 \nEven more remarkable than the Church inquiry into the nefar\u00ad\nious doings of the CIA was a parallel Congressional inquiry into \nNSA during 1975 which had uncovered 'Project Minaret', the \nillegal monitoring of domestic radicals. Although this inquiry \nhad been secret, the material reached the front page of the New \nYork Times in January 1976.60 By February, former NSA director \nLew Allen was embroiled in legal action.61 \nThis vast outpouring of secrets and scandals soon reverber\u00ad\nated in Britain. The most obvious target for British journalists \n358 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwas the activities of the CIA station in London. On 1 July 1976, \nthree days before the bicentennial anniversary of American \nIndependence, Maurice Oldfield, the Chief of SIS, spoke on the \nsubject of Anglo-American intelligence relations. The occasion \nwas the departure of the retiring head of the CIA station in \nLondon, Cord Meyer. Oldfield chose to praise Meyer's extreme \nforbearance under 'continuous and continuing press bombard\u00ad\nment'. The Americans only had themselves to blame, since \nalmost incredible stories were spilling onto the front pages of \ntheir newspapers. All enterprising British journalists had to do \nwas read the latest spy revelations in the New York Times and \nthe Washington Post, then think about what the British connec\u00ad\ntions to these stories might be. Many of the latest exposures \nconcerned NSA's high-tech world of sigint, satellites and \ncomputers, and the press in London was soon asking questions \nabout a mysterious British organisation called 'GCHQ'.62 \nGCHQ was unmasked in the summer of 1976 when the British \ninvestigative journalist Duncan Campbell wrote a pathbreaking \narticle in Time Out magazine entitled 'The Eavesdroppers' with \nan American colleague called Mark Hosenball, giving great detail \nabout both GCHQ and NSA activities.63 In Campbell's own words, \nthis was 'the importation from the United States of post\u00ad\nWatergate investigative journalism', something that was adopted \nby radical and left journalists in Britain 'at considerable speed' .64 \nCampbell had interviewed a dissident former member of NSA \nwho was visiting London, and then carried out his own research \non GCHQ, piecing the story together from overlooked fragments \nof published material. The article was the first public exposure \nof what the agency actually did, and revealed significant details \nabout the latest high-tech methods of interception. Cheltenham \nwas horrified, and Mark Hosenball was quickly deported by the \ngovernment as a threat to national security. \nShortly after the 'Eavesdroppers' story appeared, Campbell \nand another radical journalist, Crispin Aubrey, were contacted \nby John Berry, a soldier who had served for many years with \n9 Signals at the Ayios Nikolaos sigint base and who had read \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 359 \nthe article. Berry recounted his own experiences, which included \nlistening in on armoured formations during the Yom Kippur \nWar. He had once 'heard a cry to Allah by an Egyptian soldier \nas his tank was hit by an Israeli shell'. Alerted by the \n'Eavesdroppers' story, MI5 had been watching Campbell closely, \nand after meeting at Berry's flat in February 1977, Aubrey, Berry \nand Campbell were arrested and prosecuted under the Official \nSecrets Act. This soon became known as the 'ABC trial', after \nthe initials of the three defendants' surnames.65 \nThe ABC trial was all about suppressing sigint secrets, and \nquickly became a cause celebre. The prosecution fielded various \nsigint experts as witnesses, but tried to keep their identities \nsecret, introducing them only as 'Colonel X, 'Colonel B' and \nso forth. A furore erupted when 'Colonel B' was revealed in \nthe House of Commons to be none other than the redoubtable \nColonel Hugh Johnstone, who had marched out to face down \nthe Turkish tanks on the perimeter of the Ayios Nikolaos facility \non Cyprus in July 1974.66 At the trial, the defence counsel \ndiscovered that not only had the prosecution secretly applied \nto the judge to vet the jury, but that the jury contained three \nmembers who had signed the Official Secrets Act -indeed, the \nforeman was boasting to fellow jurors of his exploits in the SAS. \nWhen this was revealed on a television programme hosted by \nRussell Harty, the judge felt the process had been compromised \nand discharged the jury. A retrial had to be initiated, and proceed\u00ad\nings were still ongoing in the summer of 1978.67 \nA vigorous' ABC Defence Committee' was operating from the \nTime Out offices in Southampton Street in London in support \nof the accused. The government took great interest in the ABC \nDefence Committee, and a vast amount of very recently declas\u00ad\nsified material in government files suggests that the authorities \nhad people infiltrating the campaign. Government officials had \nonly recently been debating whether to unveil the wartime Ultra \nsecret, and now -to their disbelief -GCHQ's current activities \nfrom locations such as Cyprus were in the public eye. The trial \nonly raised the public profile of GCHQ further. On 10 March \n360 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \n1978 the ABC Defence Committee's provocative newsletter \nannounced a demonstration planned for 25 March which would \nbegin at GCHQ's Benhall site and end up at the main site at \nGCHQ Oakley. It urged: \n* Now we have an excellent opportunity to get across -not \nleast to the people of Cheltenham -what SIGINT is really \ndoing, the fact that it's illegal and the role of GCHQ as the \nhub of the system ... We've been to MI5, MI6, Scotland \nYard, parliament and many more. Now we're going where \nmuch of the dirty work goes on -CHELTENHAM!68 \n* GCHQ had noted that Duncan Campbell had been investigating \nthe American sigint site at Chicksands in Bedfordshire, that \nfocused on the Soviet Air Force, and was clearly anxious about \nhow the Americans would react to this.69 \nWhen the ABC trial recommenced in the summer of 1978, \nthe government was severely embarrassed. It turned out that \nmost of the information that it deemed secret, including the duties \nof Colonel Hugh Johnstone at Ayios Nikolaos, was freely avail\u00ad\nable to the public in the journal of the Royal Signals Regiment, \nThe Wire. In August the defence took advantage of its increas\u00ad\ningly strong position and offered a plea bargain.7o David Owen, \nthe Foreign Secretary, had initially supported the prosecution, \nbut now badly wanted the case dropped, urging that' Almost any \naccommodation is to be preferred.'71 As a result, Aubrey, Berry \nand Campbell were convicted of minor breaches of the Official \nSecrets Act, blit most of the charges were dropped. Anthony Duff, \nthe new Coordinator of Intelligence, considered that the overall \nimpact of the case was 'to make it more difficult to continue to \nrefuse to acknowledge that we undertake SIGINT in peacetime \nor that GCHQ is involved'.72 The Foreign Office legal adviser had \nbeen inspired by the case to look into whether the interception \nof communications between diplomatic missions in London and \ntheir home capitals was legal. He concluded that 'It now seems \nclear that it is at least a dubious practice.f73 \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 361 \nThe ABC trial was a landmark event. GCHQ had now been \npublicly 'outed' as Britain's signals intelligence centre -even \nthough government officials steadfastly refused to acknowledge \nthe fact. Moreover, it inspired radical campaign groups to begin \n'watching the watchers'. They now probed constantly for new \nexamples of secret activity that they could discuss in the radical \npress. The group that officials found most alarming was the State \nResearch Association, which had been fostered by the National \nCouncil for Civil Liberties and was funded by the Rowntree \nFoundation. Its purpose was to publish material on recent devel\u00ad\nopments in internal security and espionage, and its membership \noverlapped with the ABC Defence Committee. Its secretary was \nTony Bunyan, and horrified defence officials noted that all the \nmembers 'can be broadly described as unaffiliated revolution\u00ad\naries'.74 Michael Hanley, the Director General of MIS, identified \nDuncan Campbell as the person of greatest interest.75 \nThe ABC trial showed that sigint, with its vast satellite dishes \nand computers, was now just too big to hide. In 1978, as the \ntrial drew to a close, the Cabinet Secretary, John Hunt, advised \nPrime Minister James Callaghan that there had been numerous \npress references to 'the intelligence role of GCHQ, to its Director, \nto some of its stations, to its relationship with NSA and to the \nfact that it succeeded the Government Code and Cypher School' .76 \nThe government has repeatedly claimed that GCHQ's identity as \nan intelligence organisation was only revealed in the 1980s. In \nreality, it was already widely known by 1976. What finally pulled \nthe lid off Cheltenham was a revelatory book called The Puzzle \nPalace by the investigative journalist James Bamford. Published \non 23 September 1982, it detailed the super-secret relationship \nbetween NSA and GCHQ by using the same methodical open \nsource research employed by Duncan Campbell. This relation\u00ad\nship was still very secret, and in NSA's own words, 'GCHQ was \nnot amused: Yet much of what Bamford revealed about sigint \nlay in unclassified newsletters and obscure libraries; he had only \npointed to what was in plain sight. NSA concedes that Bamford's \nresearch was 'meticulous', and that he 'wrote the book' on how \n362 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nto research a reclusive organisation from open sources.77 Together, \nDuncan Campbell and James Bamford confirmed a fundamental \ntruth: that there are no secrets, only lazy researchers.78 \nNevertheless, these new investigative writers were regarded as \na serious threat, and one of NSA's Directors later asserted that \nThe Puzzle Palace was used by the Soviet Union and China to \ntarget Western sigint operations.79 \nRemarkably, in 1982, even as Bamford's book came out, GCHQ \nwas still trying to keep a lid on certain technical aspects of Ultra. \nAlthough the importance of Ultra in assisting Allied wartime \nstrategy had now been revealed, little had been said about the \ndark arts of code-breaking that had been practised in Bletchley \nPark's Hut Six. Just as GCHQ had feared, once the general Ultra \nsecret was out, veterans, historians and journalists rushed forward \nto write about code-breaking in more and more detail.80 Gordon \nWelchman, who had been head of Hut Six, was one of the.se \nwould-be authors. In 1941 he had drafted the famous plea sent \nto Churchill asking for more resources for Bletchley Park, to \nwhich Churchill hcd famously responded 'Action This Day'.81 \nOnce he had heard about Frederick Winterbotham's book The \nUltra Secret, Welchman was burning to tell his own story, 'regard\u00ad\nless of the Official Secrets Act' .82 He went to GCHQ for a chat \nwith two senior figures, George Goodall and Douglas Nicoll. \nAlthough they were 'very friendly', they said they had no choice \nbut to keep to the 'party line', and told Welchman that he must \nnot give away the 'methodological secrets' of code-breaking.83 \nWelchman went ahead regardless. When he finally 'sprung' \nhis book on GCHQ in 1982, it was horrified. Entitled The Hut \nSix Story, it first appeared in the United States in order to evade \ncensorship. Welchman continued to publish on code-breaking \nhistory, and in 1985 he wrote an article in a new journal founded \nby the historians Christopher Andrew and Michael Handel which \nwould soon become the premier outlet for the new field of \nintelligence history. Welchman followed proper procedure and \nsubmitted his article to the D-Notice Committee, which \nUNMASKING GCHQ: THE ABC TRIAL 363 \nrequested no deletions. However, a few days later he received \na stiff letter from the new Director of GCHQ that spoke of the \n'great shock' his book had caused at GCHQ, and claimed his \nwritings had done 'direct damage to security' and had 'let us \ndown'. The tone was rude at best, and caused indignation \namongst veteran code-breakers.84 The Welchman affair touched \nBletchley Park veterans on both sides of the Atlantic: in 1985 \nhis American friend Bill Bundy was asked to give a talk about \nBletchley Park to a veterans' group of 'former cryptographic \ntypes', but NSA called him to say that 'in no circumstances' \nshould he talk about any Hut Six techniques.85 \nSilly arguments about wartime secrets were soon swept away \nby the infamous Spycatcher affair. In 1985 Peter Wright, an MIS \nofficer who had worked closely with GCHQ's Ken Perrin on \nshort-range sigint, published his sensational but unreliable \nmemoirs, subtitled The Candid Autobiography of a Senior Intelligence \nOfficer. The book revealed the level of paranoia about Soviet \nmoles inside Western governments during the 1960s and 1970s, \nand the scale of MI5's efforts to catch them. Like Welchman, in \norder to get around the Official Secrets Act Wright chose to \npublish overseas -in Australia, where he then lived. Sir Roben \nArmstrong, the Cabinet Secretary, made a farcical attempt in the \nAustralian courts to defend Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'S \npolicy of blanket secrecy. Even now, Spycatcher remains the only \nmemoir by a British intelligence officer that deals in any detail \nwith post-war sigint. GCHQ informed NSA that it was 'upset' \nabout Wright's book, and now considered that many aspects of \nsigint were 'at risk'.86 Indeed, the publication of Spycatcher \nprompted GCHQ to ask Margaret Thatcher for a tougher Official \nSecrets Act, 'making it a crime to leak' and giving it the power \nto reduce the pensions of those found gUilty of leaking.87 \nMany found this decade of revelations bewildering. In early \n1974, wartime Ultra was still a secret. By 1986, the shelves of \nbookshops were groaning under the. weight of spy books. \nIntelligence history -both popular and academic - had arrived \n364 TURBULENCE AND TERROR \nwith Cl. vengeance. Bletchley Park veterans such as Gordon \nWelchman, Bill Bundy and Stuart Milner-Barry were all avid \nreaders of this new material. Milner-Barry felt obliged to read \nSpycatcher, partly because it accused so many of his former asso\u00ad\nciates of being Soviet spies. Having read the book, he then \npurchased John Costello's Mask of Treachery (1988), a biography \nof Anthony Blunt, which he judged 'interminable'. Milner-Barry \nthought Costello was 'paranoiac about homosexuals who abound \non every page', but he read on because there was a whole \nchapter devoted to John Cairncross, the 'Fifth Man', who had \nbeen in Hut Thlee. Oddly, Milner-Barry noted that 'Neither I \nnor anybody 1 have asked in Hut 3 can remember Cairncross \nat all.' He complained to his friend Bill Bundy: 'I seem to have \nbeen reading nothing but moles for weeks and I am heartily \nsick of them all. '88 \nBritain's new Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, was also fed \nup with moles. On 17 November 1979, only months after her \nelection, she was embarrassed and angered by the unmasking \nof Sir Anthony Blunt, Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, as the \n'Fourth Man'. She was also incandescent with rage at the publi\u00ad\ncation of Spycatcher. As with her predecessors Harold Macmillan \nand Harold Wilson, the House of Commons greatly enjoyed \nbaiting her about these security failures. Thatcher was so exas\u00ad\nperated by the continual spy revelations that she ordered a \nclampdown, even forbidding the publication of any further \nvolumes in the government's own official intelligence history \nseries, initiated by Burke Trend and Dick White. The final \nvolumes, including one by the world-famous military historian \nMichael Howard, were suppressed for almost a decade by the \nsame groups of secret servants that had commissioned them in \nthe Hrst place.89 Meanwhile, Westminster and Whitehall were \nnow plunged into a legendary period of controversy and \nconfrontation -the Thatcher era.90 \nTHE 19805 \nINTO THE \nTHATCHER ERA \n19 \nGeoffrey Prime -The GCHQ Mole \n... because of the nature of GCHQ 's work and their need for staff \nwith esoteric specialisms they attracted many odd and eccentric \ncharacters. Prime did not stand out as he might have done else\u00ad\nwhere. \nUK Security Commission, Report on Geoffrey Prime, \nMay 19831 \nThe Thatcher era was partly defined by mole-mania. In the \nautumn of 1979 Margaret Thatcher made an announcement in \nthe House of Commons identifying Sir Anthony Blunt as the \n'Fourth Man', one of a ring of Cambridge spies that had included \nKim Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean. Her hand had \nbeen forced because several newspapers had hinted strongly at \nBlunt's KGB identity. Because of Blunt's close associations with \nthe royal family -he was Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures -\nthis was as much a social as a security scandal. It also confirmed \nthe public perception of the Establishment as bungling toffs who \nwere not to be trusted with security matters. Although the \nauthorities had known about the Blunt case for more than a \ndecade, his public exposure unleashed a worldwide media quest \nto uncover further traitors. A blizzard of unlikely names filled \nthe pages of the newspapers, including three former senior \nmembers of MI5: Sir Roger Hollis, Graham Mitchell and Guy \nLiddel1.2 \nMargaret Thatcher found these matters intensely vexing. She \nwas also extremely agitated about what she called 'hostile forces' \nattempting to foment industrial unrest. These included a broad \nswathe of Trotskyites and militants, some of whom were in \ntouch with foreign governments, who wished to use industrial \naction for political purposes. Strikes at British Leyland, Britain's \n368 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nlast large-scale car manufacturer, which were intended to disrupt \na government recovery plan, had been organised with the co\u00ad\noperation of the Communist Party of Great Britain, which was \nin turn taking money from the Soviet Union. Although the \nminers' strike of 1982 had genuinely domestic origins, the Soviet \nCommunist Party nevertheless funded it to the tune of more \nthan half a million pounds, albeit against the advice of the KGB. \nSuch active intervention in British internal affairs generated a \ncertain amount of paranoia in British government. This extended \nto the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, which was also \nwatched closely by MI5 for evidence of foreign influence. Several \nleading figures in CND were subjected to surveillance, including \nthe future Cabinet Minister Harriet Harman. The Ministry of \nDefence was so worried about CND that it set up a special unit, \nDS.19, to counteract its activities, and wild rumours abounded \nthat some of the protesters outside American bases were really \nSoviet special forces or 'Spetnaz' in disguise. In fact, during the \n1980s the most dangerous KGB mole was in none of these \nplaces -instead he was at GCHQ.3 \nSecurity within GCHQ had always been a nightmare. \nElsewhere in government, a person who was regarded as a \npossible security risk could be gradually transferred to a less \nsensitive area. This option did not exist within GCHQ, since \neverywhere was sensitive. Security problems overlapped with \ntrade union worries. Even in the mid-1950s, some GCHQ \nmanagers were anxious about Communist influence in the \nElectrical Trades Union, which was prominent at Cheltenham.4 \nThere was also the sheer scale of positive vetting required in \nsuch a large organisation: as we have seen, despite an increase \nin the numbers of investigating officers, a backlog had built up. \nMost of all there was the problem of document security. All of \nGCHQ's basic 'working material' was highly secret, yet it was \nso super-abundant that it could not be catalogued. In other \nwords it would be easy for a spy to smuggle out papers that his \nor her branch was working on.5 In the 1970s the Security \nCommission had called for the certified destruction of top-secret \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MO~E 369 \ndocuments that were no longer required. However, this concept \nwas completely unwcrkable within GCHQ, since there was just \ntoo much such material. One of GCHQ's key customers, the \nWarsaw Pact order of battle cell within the Defence Intelligence \nStaff, handled 'about 10,000 CODEWORD signals' each week. \nIt was impossible to record all of these signals, still less to certify \ntheir destruction.6 \nThere had been countless security reviews during the 1960s \nand 1970s, yet all had missed the most important chink in \nGCHQ's armour: the armed services personnel who worked for \nthe sigint arms of the military. Somehow, because they wore a \nuniform, these individuals were thought to be more reliable \nthan civilian staff. Yet they were harder to vet because of their \nitinerant backgrounds, undertook the most repetitive and demor\u00ad\nalising work, and were often posted to inhospitable locations. \nAt these far-flung military outstations morale was often low, \nand operators were vulnerable to KGB recruiters. Berlin and \nCyprus were subject to frequent KGB predation, and it is unlikely \nthat all the Soviet recruitment successes have yet come to light. \nBrian Patchett and Douglas Britten were examples of this, and \nthere were others yet to be uncovered.7 \nGrowing up in Staffordshire, Geoffrey Prime suffered a difficult \nchildhood. His mother and father had an unhappy relationship, \nand Prime had problems making friends at school. He was sexu\u00ad\nally assaulted by an adult relative, which probably left lasting \neffects upon him. After securing good '0' levels, mostly in \nlanguages, Prime left St Joseph's Catholic College, Stoke-on\u00ad\nTrent, and began dull work at a factory as a junior wages clerk. \nTwo years later, in 1956, National Service in the RAF offered \nhim a happy escape from this existence. He nurtured ambitions \nto train as flight crew, hoping perhaps to serve as a Radio \nOperator, but due to colour blindness he was relegated to duties \nas a storesman. Eventually his talent for languages was spotted, \nand he was sent to RAF Crail in Scotland to begin the Russian \nLanguage course. The fact that he was required to sign up for \n370 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nregular service was of no consequence to him, since he hoped \nto gain professional qualifications. Excelling at Russian, he was \nsoon an acting sergeant. He was then sent to London University \non an advanced Russian course, but he did not fit in well and \nfailed the course after three months. His rank and privileges \nwere taken from him, and he returned to a mundane life in \nthe stores.s \nStill only twenty-one, Prime secured a posting to Kenya, and \nwas promoted back to corporal. He filled his spare time by \nlearning Swahili, becoming fluent and speaking with the native \nlabour force at his airbase. He was shocked by the poverty and \nwhat he saw as the colonial exploitation of Kenya. He also \ndisliked the racist attitudes of the long-term European settlers, \nand on one occasion reported an officer for treating a Kenyan \nbadly. It was at this point in his life that Prime began to take \nan interest in Communist radio broadcasts and to read the maga\u00ad\nzine Soviet Weekly. By the time he returned to Britain in April \n1962 he was more mature, and confident enough to apply for \ntraining in languages again. He spent a year at the Joint Technical \nServices Language School at Tangmere in Surrey, and in May \n1964 was posted to the large sigint unit at RAF Gatow in Berlin, \nalthough he was not vetted until May 1966. He carried out his \nfunction as a wireless operator on the monitoring of Russian \nvoice transmissions well enough to resume the rank of sergeant \nin May 1968.9 \nWest Berlin was in effect a rather small, inhospitable island \nsurrounded by East Germany. Most Allied troops arrived by \nsealed train, and this was how Prime came to the notice of the \nSoviets. As his train moved slowly through a checkpoint, he \nthrew a message offering his services as a spy at the feet of a \nnearby Soviet sentry. The KGB followed it up, and eventually \nplaced a mysterious magnetic cylinder under the handle of the \ndoor of Prime's car. Hidden inside were instructions telling him \nto travel on the underground train to Friedrichstrasse station \nin East Berlin. After several meetings he persuaded the KGB \nthat he was sincere in his desire to work for them. Prime insisted \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 371 \nthat he was ideologically motivated, but the KGB pressed money \nupon him, a standard gambit designed to entrap a new agent. \nKnowing that Prime's enlistment was about to run out after \ntwelve years in the RA F, the Soviets encouraged him to apply \nfor a post with GCHQ at Cheltenham. To his surprise he was \nsuccessful, and returned to Britain.lO \nThe KGB now began work in earnest. Prime was invited to \nmake a secret visit back to Germany, and was instructed to change \nplanes in Amsterdam to cover his tracks. On arrival in East Berlin \nhe was installed in a flat at Karlshorst, the main KGB centre, \nwhere he was given a full training in spycraft. All the time he \nwas watched, and each night he was locked in. The KGB also \nmade clumsy attempts to explore his sexual preferences, and \npresumed he was gay. Prime was angered by this, protesting \ncontinually that he was offering to assist the KGB for ideological \nreasons. Although this was true, the money he was offered seems \nto have become more important to him over time. II His KGB \ncase officers went by the cover names 'Igor' and 'Valya', and \ninstructed him in the exotic paraphernalia of espionage, including \ninvisible inks, one-time pads and microdots. He was supplied with \na Minox camera which he later used to photograph sensitive \ndocuments, and was also given \u00a3400 which he hid, along with \nthe equipment, in a briefcase with a concealed compartment. His \nhandlers told him that all further meetings had to be in either \nFinland or Austria, and Prime chose Austria.12 The last thing they \ndid was tell him his code name, which was 'Rowlands'. \nThe meetings abroad were an odd aspect of KGB tradecraft. \nAs we have seen, other KGB agents such as Douglas Britten \nhad local KGB officers assigned to them as handlers wherever \nthey went. Prime's different arrangements reflect the circum\u00ad\nstances of his recruitment. His initial message, thrown from a \ntroop train, had been taken by a Soviet soldier to his security \nofficer. From there it had naturally reached the Third Directorate \nof the KGB, which looked after military security within Soviet \nArmy units. Running agents in the West was not its main respon\u00ad\nsibility, but having found Prime by accident, it was not about \n372 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nto let him gO.13 Just like Western intelligence, the KGB was \nriven by interdepartm~ntaljealousies. Ideally, Prime should have \nbeen run by a KGB officer based in Britain, which would have \noffered him the support and companionship that is critical to \nthe successful development of a spy. However, these activities \nwere controlled by the First Directorate of the KGB, which \nundertook espionage. Arguably, had Prime been handled by the \nFirst Directorate he might well have lasted longer and done \nmuch more damage.14 \nOnce back in England, Prime began his employment with \nGCHQ. By night he received radio messages, and was told about \na dead-letter drop location at Esher in Surrey. There he found \na note of congratulations and another payment of \u00a3400. \nEnergised, he now went to work with his Minox, copying GCHQ \ndocuments at home and initially sending them on to his control \nin East Berlin in the form of microdots. He communicated with \nhis handlers through a short-wave radio, encyphering his \nmessages using one-time pads. More dead-letter boxes were \ndeveloped in the Abbey Wood area of south-east London and \nat Banstead railway station in Surrey. His meetings with \ncontrollers were rare and almost always abroad, reflecting \nPrime's rather awkward Third Directorate ownership. He seems \nto have rendezvoused with them in Vienna in 1969, Ireland in \n1970, Rome in 1970 and Cyprus in 1972. He preferred these \npersonal meetings, since the dead-letter boxes could not accom\u00ad\nmodate the large number of films his espionage was producing.J5 \nNevertheless, he made some use of dead-letter boxes in Britain. \nMI5's Stella Rimington recalls that he used classic tradecraft, \nincluding an empty Coca-Cola can, to convey messages, as well \nas chalk marks on telegraph poles and trees.16 \nAlthough Prime now worked for GCHQ, he was not based \nin Cheltenham. Instead, he was part of a translator pool called \nthe London Processing Group (LPG), a curious leftover from \nthe MI6 Y Section which had run the Berlin tunnel operation \nin the 1950s. A large and varied group of translators had been \nassembled at the LPG offices in Carlton Gardens. Some of them \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 373 \nwere Baltic emigres, chosen both for their excellent Russian and \ntheir hatred of the Soviet Union; some were former Indian Army \nofficers; some were new graduates. When the Berlin tunnel was \nuncovered in 1956 there was still an enormous backlog of intel\u00ad\nligence material, but by 1958 it was judged to be out of date. \nSIS handed its translator team on to GCHQ, where it processed \nthe increasing flow of material from telephone intercepts and \naggressive bugging by all the secret agencies. Realising that the \narrival of dozens of Baltic emigres in the Cotswolds would raise \nawkward questions, GCHQ decided to keep this unit separate. \nAn office was found at St Dunstan's Hill in the City of London, \nwhere it formed an 'isolated cell' Y \nStarting work there on 9 September 1968, Prime initially \nspent several months in the Control Unit, where all the various \ntranscripts were checked for quality before being forwarded to \nCheltenham. This gave him a wonderful overview of everything \nbeing produced at LPG. IS He was part of a new wave of staff. \nThe wartime Baltic emigres were ageing, and could not be \nreplenished. Their replacements were ex-services sigint people \nlike himself, and university Russian graduates. This prompted \na culture change at LPG. The work was often tiring, tedious \nand difficult, but the emigres had been content to carry it out \n'in a void', knowing nothing of its context or importance. This \nwas not true of the younger British intake, who were bored \nand dissatisfied, leading to a high resignation rate. In order to \nmotivate them they were informed about the importance and \ncontext of their work, encouraged to ask questions about the \nwhole intelligence framework, and deliberately told more than \nthey needed to know. Prime thrived in this new atmosphere.19 \nIn 1975 he returned to Vienna for one of his periodic meet\u00ad\nings with his handlers. He had important news. Most of the \nBaltic staff had now retired, so LPG was in the process of being \nmoved to Cheltenham.20 The KGB officers were very pleased, \nsmelling the possibility of wider espionage within GCHQ. Their \ndelight was expressed in a gift of \u00a3800 before Prime's departure. \nOn 22 March 1976 he arrived at Cheltenham and joined 130, \n374 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \npart of J Division 'Special Sigint', which handled Soviet traffic. \nJ30 was in a security-compartmentalised spur in B Block. Like \nmany divisions it had its own vault, and Prime was one of the \nthree senior officers in his section with access to it. It was easy \nfor him to remove documents at will, take them home and \nphotograph them, returning them the next day. He was also able \nto photocopy documents during his lunch break, since the \namount of paper being used in the copiers was never checked. \nOn 30 June 1976, only three months after arriving at \nCheltenham, Prime was promoted to Higher Linguist Specialist, \nand became the leader of a small group of transcribers in J25, \na different part of J Division.21 In November he was transferred \nto another unit that was more focused on the intelligence \nanalysis of transcribed material. He also became Personal \nSecurity Supervisor for his section. Prime was moving onwards \nand upwards.22 One of his duties in his newly elevated post \nwas delivering occasional lectures. As a nervous and intensely \nintroverted man he loathed this part of his job, and would \nbecome agitated about the prospect some days in advance. On \n22 September 1977 he failed to show up for a lecture, and \nresigned shortly afterwards.23 GCHQ's Security Division believed \nthat his decision to leave was partly caused by having to \nmanage office staff, which he was bad at, and the lectures, \n'which terrified him'. However, it also reflected changes in his \npersonal life.24 \nBack in August 1969, while still working for LPG in London, \nPrime had met a woman called Helena Organ through a marriage \nbureau, and they eventually married. The union was not \nsuccessful, perhaps due to Prime's introverted nature and pecu\u00ad\nliar sexual proclivities, which included an interest in young girls. \nHelena Prime found a large sum of money in their home in April \n1973, and it is now thought that Prime confessed to her in outline \nthat he was helping the Soviets, and that this was how he had \naccrued the money. She panicked, and not knowing where to \nturn, confided in a close friend, a Mrs Barsby. Remarkably, Mrs \nBarsby was one of Prime's referees for his security clearance, and \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 375 \nin time a routine positive vetting check became due. However, \nthe security officer who visited Mrs Barsby was so abrupt, and \nasked her questions of such a personal nature, that she took an \ninstant dislike to him. As a result she did not reveal anything \nabout Helena Prime's suspicions. Geoffrey and Helena Prime \nagreed to a divorce the following year. \nWhen Prime moved to Cheltenham in 1976 he found lodg\u00ad\nings at Laburnum Cottage in Pittville Crescent Lane, owned by \na thirty-three-year-old divorcee, Rhona Ratcliffe. They got on \nwell, and on 18 June 1977 they married. Apart from a wife, \nPrime also gained three young children. By all accounts he was \nrespected by the children, took an interest in their lives and \nprovided for them well. The changes in his personal life seemed \nto feed into his decision to resign from GCHQ in September of \nthat year, and after a disastrous attempt at selling quality wines \nhe became a taxi driver. Prime was now at something of a cross\u00ad\nroads in his life. He later told his interrogators that at this point \nhe twice resolved to defect to the Soviets, but did not go through \nwith it. He no longer listened to the KGB messages, and ceased \nto operate as an agent. Because he was run at a distance by the \nThird Directorate, there was no local KGB case officer to try to \ndissuade him from this decision. Ken Sly, his manager at \nCheltenham, was puzzled by his resignation, recalling, 'He \ncertainly wasn't pushed out by the Head of his Branch and there \nseemed to be no reason why he should leave a very lucrative \npost at GCHQ.'25 \nIn April 1980, nearly three years after he had left GCHQ, \nPrime was contacted again by the KGB. He travelled to see them \nin Vienna, and spent three pleasant days with his handlers on \na river cruise to Hungary and back. The Soviets hoped to \npersuade him to rejoin GCHQ. In fact, some believe that he was \nstill working for GCHQ on a casual basis, since it used taxi \ndrivers to take certain kinds of sigint product to RAF Brize \nNorton airbase for despatch to the United States, and preferred \nex-GCHQ employees with live security clearances to transport \nespecially sensitive material.26 Although Prime refused to rejoin \n376 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nGCHQ, he had been canny. Prior to his resignation he had had \nthe foresight to take copies of five hundred secret documents, \nwhich he was then able to hand over in segments. On 16 May \n1980 he delivered fifteen reels of film to the KGB in Vienna, \nfor which he was paid \u00a3600. More than a year later, on 16 \nNovember 1981, he travelled to East Berlin, where his stock of \nespionage equipment was replenished. He still refused to rejoin \nGCHQ, but now handed over his last haul of stored material. \nThis was top-grade stuff, signified by the fact that he now \nreceived \u00a34,000 from the delighted Soviets. The head of GCHQ's \nSecurity Division would later conclude that while all of Prime's \nespionage was 'very grave', the 'most damaging of all' was the \nmaterial he handed over in Berlin in 1981.27 \nBritain's security authorities have always maintained that \n'The damage inflicted by Prime was of a very high order. '28 NSA \nhas concurred, concluding that 'Prime's case was of major impor\u00ad\ntance for cryptology.'29 What exactly had he handed over to his \nKGB masters? When he moved from London to GCHQ \nCheltenham he had become a Higher Linguist in J Division, \nand was given a 'Byeman' clearance to work on material from \nthe new American sigint satellites. The key satellites were code\u00ad\nnamed 'Ryolite' and 'Canyon', and had first been launched in \n1969. They had been designed primarily to pick up Soviet missile \nlaunches and collect telemetry from missiles, which the Soviets \nwere not bothering to encrypt. Surprisingly, they also proved \ncapable of collecting huge amounts of communications in the \nVHF and UHF wavebands that were spilling into space, and \nmicrowave telephone traffic. Space was an undiscovered sigint \ngoldmine. By the mid-1970s there were more than a dozen of \nthese satellites in orbit, producing a fantastic amount of intel\u00ad\nligence on Russia, China, Vietnam and the Middle East, much \nof it from telephone calls. Because the 'take' was so enormous, \nNSA had been forced to ask its UKUSA allies to help process it. \nIt was for this reason that Prime was pressed into service on \n'Canyon' intercepts.3o \nPrime's material dovetailed nicely with intelligence provided \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 377 \nby John Walker, a US Navy Warrant Officer working on top\u00ad\nsecret communications who had been recruited by the KGB at \nabout the same time as him. It was also supplemented by mat\u00ad\nerial that the KGB was receiving from yet another spy, called Ed \nBoyce, who was working for TRW Inc., the American company \nthat made some of the most secret spy satellites, and who told \nthe Soviets about the latest 'Argus' and 'Pyramider' satellites. \nArgus formed part of a project that had the capability to listen \nin on the microwave links used in Russia's phone network. \nTogether, Prime, Walker and Boyce inflicted horrific damage \nupon Western sigint and comsec operations. In the late 1970s, \nafter thirty years of effert, the Americans had begun to make \nsome headway with high-grade Soviet diplomatic traffic, and \nthis was one of the many secrets that was given away.31 Indeed, \nPrime, Walker and Boyce were so productive that they spurred \na major reorganisation within the KGB. Hitherto all sigint and \ncomsec had been handled by the KGB's Eighth Directorate. In \n1969 a new Sixteenth Directorate was established to deal with \nthe increased flow of sigint, leaving the Eighth Directorate to \nfocus exclusively on the defensive challenge posed by Western \nsigint, about which it now knew a great deal.32 \nPrime's most damaging revelation concerned the vast, top\u00ad\nsecret and highly expensive Anglo-American effort to track \nSoviet strategic submarines. The official line was that ballistic\u00ad\nmissile-carrying submarines were undetectable, since this re\u00ad\ninforced the stability of deterrence for both sides in the Cold \nWar. Secretly, however, the West was enjoying significant success \nin tracking these submarines. By the early 19705 this involved \nthree technologies. The first was SOSUS, a line of undersea \nmicrophones that listened for the engines of Soviet submarines. \nA joint UK/US project team had identified RAF Brawdy on the \ncoast of Wales as the ideal site for an additional SOSUS centre. \nBritain had provided the land and the capital costs, while the \nUnited States contributed the personnel and the equipment for \nthe intelligence analysis.33 The second element was airborne \nmaritime patrol aircraft with sonar. The third and most hidden \n378 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nelement, code-named 'Project Sambo', was efforts to track the \nlow-frequency radio transmissions of submarines when they \nrose closer to the surface to communicate with their head\u00ad\nquarters in Moscow or with supply ships. This was an integrated \nUKUSA effort, with NSA running twenty-one listening stations \nand the allies running a further eight.34 Prime revealed this \nsuper-secret programme. \nPrime was not caught as a result of his spying, but because \nof his criminal paedophile activities. He had a long history of \nmaking obscene phone calls, and during 1981 he became more \ndangerous, and began to indulge his desire to perform sexual \nacts in front of young girls, carrying out attacks on two occa\u00ad\nsions and escaping undiscovered. However, later in the year he \nattacked a third girl, a fourteen-year-old gymnast, in her own \nhome. When the girl screamed, Prime was frightened and ran \noff. He fled the scene in his car, which he had parked in a lane \nnear a farm. One of the nearby farm workers knew a lot about \ncars, and was able to give a detailed description of the vehicle \nto the police, stating with certainty that it was an'S' reg brown \ntwo-tone Mark IV Ford Cortina. Although there were 426 's' \nreg Cortinas in the immediate surrounding area, only a dozen \nwere coloured 'Roman Bronze'. \nThe next day Geoffrey Prime opened the front door of his \nhome to two detectives from Hereford CID. Detective Sergeant \nWilkes and Detective Constable Miriam Rhodes asked him about \nthe two-tone 'S' reg Cortina parked in the drive outside. Wilkes \nnoticed that Prime bore an uncanny resemblance to the iden\u00ad\ntikit photo of the suspect, and was wearing the same style of \nchecked shirt. Prime must have realised that he was a promin\u00ad\nent suspect, and became very agitated when Wilkes asked him \nfor his fingerprints. Although he was not yet arrested, Prime \nknew it was only a matter of time. That evening, he took his \nwife Rhona out to Cleeve Hill, a local beauty spot, and after a \nheavy silence blurted out, 'It's me they want.' He then told her \nthe truth about his sexual activities. Only that evening, over a \nglass of brandy, did he finally confess that he had also been a \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 379 \nKGB spy for over a decade. In fact Rhona already suspected the \nespionage, and initially decided to stand by her husband. The \nnext day Prime was arrested, and his car and house were \nsearched. Apart from 2,287 record cards, bearing notes about \nand photographs of young girls, which were bagged and taken \naway as evidence, a black leather briefcase was also seized. This \nwas later opened by Prime, in the presence of police officers, \nto reveal the secret compartment filled with KGB equipment, \nincluding a camera and one-time pads. For now, the police \nremained quite unaware of his espionage activities.35 \nRhona Prime was now having doubts. On 23 May 1982 she \ncontacted the police and informed them about Prime's work for \nthe KGB.36 The trigger for this was her discovery of a mass of \nespionage equipment in the house, including many envelopes \naddressed to places in East Germany, two one-time pads with \ncolumns of five-figure numbers, and some manuals on microdot \nproduction. She also gave the police a wallet with a schedule of \nradio frequencies. Later a team of specialists combed Laburnum \nCottage with minute thoroughness: \n* For two days they searched, leaving nothing to chance: \nwall cavities explored with cameras controlled by flexible \ncables; insulating material removed from the loft; chimney, \ndrains and sewers examined; fitted furniture dismantled; \nsoft furnishings X-rayed; carpets and floorboards lifted ... \nThe house gradually surrendered its secrets. \n* The police eventually uncovered a tape recorder and another \nlist of radio frequencies and schedules, together with documents \nfrom GCHQ. On 25 June, Detective Inspector David Cole inter\u00ad\nviewed Prime and switched on the tape recorder. Coded messages \nin German filled the room -the unmistakable sound of espion\u00ad\nage. Prime offered the reply that it was merely his hobby, \nlistening to the radio and twiddling the tuning knob. However, \nthe game was clearly up, and at 4.30 p.m. the next day he made \na complete confession.37 On Wednesday, 10 November 1982, \n380 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nGeoffrey Arthur Prime, then aged forty-four, pleaded guilty to \nseven counts of espior.age and three further sexual offences at \nthe Old Bailey. For spying, he received a sentence of thirty-five \nyears, plus a further three years for the sexual offences. The \ntotal of thirty-eight years meant that he would be eighty-two \non his release in 2020 if he served the full term. He was paroled \nafter serving half his sentence, and was released to a secret \naddress in 2001.38 \nThe Gloucestershire police who investigated Prime had \nworked tirelessly on the case. They travelled the length and \nbreadth of the country, combing RAF personnel archives and \npersuading travel agents to hunt through mountains of past \nreceipts for evidence of Prime's visits to meet his KGB con\u00ad\ntrollers. Yet, to their surprise, the senior management of \nGCHQ were less than helpful. When Detective Inspector Cole, \nwho led the case, visited GCHQ to confirm that items found in \nPrime's possession had been unlawfully taken from its prem\u00ad\nises, he and a colleague received a 'less than welcoming' recep\u00ad\ntion. He asked senior figures for formal evidential statements, \nbut was met with a 'point-blank refusal' on the grounds that \nthe material was 'far too sensitive to be discussed'. Cole recalled \nthat in twenty-five years of police investigations he had 'rarely \nencountered such a distasteful reaction'. GCHQ gave him the \nimpression that he was 'a thorough bloody nuisance' and that \nit believed these matters to be 'way above his head'. Cole also \ndetected the grade-consciousness and even class-consciousness \nthat marked GCHQ at this time. The policemen were blanked \nby the code-breakers and sent on their way. As they left by \nOakley's main gate, they realised that GCHQ would have \npreferred to see the whole embarrassing matter buried, and had \nnot even wanted Prime prosecuted.39 \nGeoffrey Prime was caught by accident, not by GCHQ's stan\u00ad\ndard security defences, and this posed some awkward questions \nfor the authorities.40 General Sir Hugh Beach led the subse\u00ad\nquent inquiry by the Security Commission. Both the Commission \nand GCHQ concluded that the security procedures had worked \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 381 \nas well as they could. Some things could be tightened up, but \nnothing that was in place at the time would have stopped Prime \nfor certain. Even random searches at the gates of GCHQ could \nhave been evaded by a concealed camera in a bag. In any case, \nthe most damaging information Prime had passed on concerned \nwhat streams of intelligence GCHQ had access to, and he could \neasily have committed this to memory, even though agent \nrunners love to have documents to send their controllers. What \nthe Security Commission was looking for were new kinds of \nprocedures that would greatly improve security.41 Basic issues, \nsuch as access to photocopiers, were tightened up, not only at \nGCHQ but right across the UKUSA system, including at CSE in \nOttawa, but ideally it wanted a new security system.42 \nIn February 1983 Beach took his Commission on a visit to \nWashington, which they found to be 'most valuable'. All the \nAmericans and 'particularly -the NSA and CIA made no secret \nof their belief that their personnel security procedures are more \neffective than our own'.43 What impressed them most was the \nroutine use of the polygraph. They noted that in 1962 a secret \nand unpublished section of the Radcliffe Inquiry into security \nprocedures in the Civil Service had recommended its use. The \nSecurity Commission thought it significant that during his inter\u00ad\nrogation Prime had conceded that if he had faced a polygraph \ntest prior to joining GCHQ in 1968, he would not have applied \nto the organisation. Their strongest recommendation was a pilot \nscheme for the introduction of the polygraph at Cheltenham. \nThey accepted that it would take time to build up expertise in \nits use, and that the political obstacles to its introduction would \nbe 'formidable'.44 Benson Buffham, a former Deputy Director \nof NSA who had recently served as the American Liaison Officer \nto GCHQ, or 'SUSLO', visited London to confer on security, and \nmade it very clear that the Americans were keen to see the \npolygraph arrive at GCHQ.45 The Security Commission also \nrecommended that vetting teams should be granted access to \nmedical records in order to check for problems such as depres\u00ad\nsion. However, this was shot down immediately by the BMA's \n382 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nCivil Service Medical Officers Group as 'neither necessary nor \njustified'.46 \nThe Prime case left some loose ends. The Security Commission \naccepted that Prime might not have been the Soviets' only source \nwithin GCHQ, and in May 1983, more than a year after Prime's \narrest, a team from MIS was probing the possibility of sub\u00ad\nagents. The Security Commission noted that the press had \nclaimed that Prime had been blackmailing some of his colleagues, \nbut it had no evidence either to substantiate this or to safely \ndiscount it.47 The biggest question that has lingered over Prime \nis whether he aS5isted the KGB in recruiting others by simply \nidentifying unhappy or vulnerable colleagues. Arguably, one of \nthe most valuable things that a spy in Prime's position could \noffer the Soviets was not access to information, but tips on \nwhich colleagues had problems with drink or debt, or had \npatterns of sexual behaviour that might leave them open to \nblackmail. This was precisely the sort of information that the \nKGB had sought from Douglas Britten on Cyprus a decade before. \nIn the wake of the Prime case there was extensive press spec\u00ad\nulation seeking to link a contemporaneous spate of suicides with \npossible KGB recruitment at Cheltenham and the ongoing \ninquiries by the security services. Interest was initially sparked \nby the death of George Franks, a Radio Operator who worked \nat the GCHQ's Empress building near Earl's Court, which moni\u00ad\ntored diplomatic and commercial traffic out of London. Franks \ndied of a heart attack after drinking a large quantity of whisky, \nbut had reportedly also tried to hang himself. However, \ncolleagues insisted that his death was most likely to be due to \nstress. Drink had always been an issue amongst the Radio \nOperators, not least because many spent time at remote service \nbases such as Cyprus where the consumption of duty-free alcohol \nwas considerable. The long shifts were also stressful, and down \nthe years quite a ! 'w were treated at the Cooney Hill psychi\u00ad\natric hospital in GI mcester. \nA further spate of three deaths looked more suspicious. The \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 383 \nfirst was Captain Timothy Fetherstone-Haugh, a twenty-nine\u00ad\nyear-old officer whc worked at the sigint station at Gatow in \nBerlin. In February 1982 he was found at the wheel of his car \ninside a garage filled with exhaust fumes. The second was Jack \nWolfenden, a senior radio officer at GCHQ who died when his \nglider crashed into a Cotswold hillside in July 1982. Wolfenden's \ngirlfriend, Judith Pither, told the inquest that he had 'acted \noddly after returning from a trip abroad'. The third was Ernst \nBrockway, a GCHQ radio officer who was found dead at his \nhome in October 1982. However, in reality many of the suicides \nthat aroused the interest of the press were by people who \nworked at other scientific establishments, and the number of \nGCHQ staff who committed suicide in this period was not statis\u00ad\ntically significant. Moreover, given that Prime was handled by \nthe Third Directorate of the KGB, it would have been hard for \nthem to employ the information he supplied to recruit more \nagents.48 \nNevertheless, further KGB recruitment efforts against British \nsigint were already under way. While the Security Commission \nwas flying off to America to look at polygraph machines, and \nthe British newspapers were worrying about people mysteri\u00ad\nously crashing their gliders, Soviet intelligence officers had \nsimply returned to their tried and trusted source: vulnerable \nyoung men employed on sigint duties in the armed services \nwho were based far from home. In 1984 eight servicemen \nserving with 9 Signals Regiment at the Ayios Nikolaos sigint \nbase on Cyprus were charged with espionage for the KGB under \nSection One of the Official Secrets Act. This' Army unit' was in \nfact a mixed outfit of soldiers, airmen and civilians working for \nGCHQ. All those arrested had confessed, however they later \nretracted their confessions, citing the grim circumstances of their \ninterrogation. On this basis all eight were acquitted. The pros\u00ad\necution had alleged that a vast amount of highly classified infor\u00ad\nmation had been passed to the Soviets when one of the accused \nwas blackmailed by an Arab called 'John' after becoming \n384 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \ninvolved in homosexual acts. The government claimed that a \nKGB officer code-named 'Alex' had then worked with 'John' \nand one of the defendants to exert pressure on the other defen\u00ad\ndants. Much of the material was reportedly handed over at the \nChiquito nightclub at Larnaca on Cyprus, and several exotic \ncabaret singers were flown to London to give evidence. However, \nthe prosecution failed due to the incompetent and coercive inter\u00ad\nrogations.49 \nThe Security Commission was rolled out yet again. This time \nit could not miss the elementary clues. In October 1986 it \nreported that it had discovered that there were security diffi\u00ad\nculties with the employment of young and fairly immature \npeople on top-secret activities in obscure locations. Officers had \ntaken little interest in their off-duty activities, and document \nsecurity at 9 Signals Regiment at Ayios Nikolaos had been poor. 50 \nThe Commission reported this as if it was a revelation, but in \nfact it had been obvious since the Patchett and Britten cases in \nthe 1960s. There were further parallels in the British clerical \nand support staff who the Soviets had managed to recruit at \nBritain's Moscow Fmbassy, most of whom have not yet been \npublicly named.51 \nMeanwhile, GCHQ rejoiced at the uncovering of American \nspies like Edward Howard in the CIA and Ronald Pelton in NSA. \nThey joined a growing throng of KGB spies inside the United \nStates, including John Walker and his family, that helpfully put \nthe Geoffrey Prime case in the shade. Ronald Pelton was espe\u00ad\ncially damaging. He had pursued a career path almost identical \nto that of Prime, learning Russian while serving in a front-line \nAir Force sigint unit doing voice intercept at Peshawar in Pakistan \nin the mid -1960s. He then transferred to NSA, and worked there \nuntil 1980. In 1984 he ran into financial difficulty, and decided \nto travel to Austria, where he sold his knowledge of NSA activ\u00ad\nities to the KGB. One important programme he compromised \nwas 'Ivy Bells', a joint NSA-US Navy operation which tapped \nSoviet undersea communication cables using submarines. Pelton \nconfessed under interrogation in 1986, and was given three \nGEOFFREY PRIME -THE GCHQ MOLE 385 \nconsecutive life sentences.52 In 1985 William Odom, Director of \nNSA, worried that there might be other agents. He was also \nconcerned that some of the defending lawyers were 'radical', \nand would deliberately try to use the trials to expose more sigint \nsecrets, especially NSA's very successful programmes of covert \ncomint collection from embassies in the Middle East.53 \nIn the 1980s the American intelligence community uncov\u00ad\nered many KGB spies within its ranks, and was entering a period \nof mole-mania, not dissimilar to the one previously endured by \nthe British. The American equivalent of Kim Philby, a senior \nCIA officer named Aldrich Ames, was yet to be unmasked. By \ncontrast, the British were at last winning the spy war against \nthe Soviets. SIS had recruited a senior KGB officer, Oleg \nGordievsky, a prolific source who bravely stayed in place and \nprovided vital intelligence during the last decade of the Cold \nWar. It is widely thought that his information led to the 'Cyprus \nEight' prosecution in 1984.54 More importantly, by 1985 GCHQ \nhad managed to decode some of the messages of the agents \nworking for the East German intelligence service in Britain, \nwhich led to charges being made against them. For the first \ntime, after anxious deliberation, GCHQ presented intercepts as \nevidence during closed court sessions.55 \nMIS continued to debrief Geoffrey Prime regularly, long after \nhe reached Wormwood Scrubs Prison. 'They come up once or \ntwice a week,' said Prime, 'and ask an awful lot of questions.' \nPrime was the first KGB agent to be held in a British prison for \nsome years. Dave Wait, one of his fellow inmates at Wormwood \nScrubs, explains that the authorities still remembered the spec\u00ad\ntacular escape of George Blake, who in 1966 had leapt to freedom \nfrom a window in D Wing of the same prison. As a result, Prime \nwas accompanied everywhere by two warders, and had his own \nspecially designed, escape-proof exercise area: 'Two sides are \nbrick walls, the other two are honeycombed concrete and thick \nunbreakable glass, a box twenty feet high for Prime to walk \naround on his own.' At this time Wait, who was serving a life \n386 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nsentence for murder, was passing his time serving as the prison \nlibrarian. He recalls Prime's first visit to the library. Prime asked \nhow many books he was allowed to borrow at one time, and \nWait replied with a grin that officially he could have six, but \nhe would stretch the allowance a bit, as long as he didn't 'run \noff with them' to Russia. Prime chose six books including a \nvolume of advanced mathematics, Plato's The Republic and \nChapman Pincher's recent book about the KGB penetration of \nthe West, Their Trade is Treachery.56 \n20 \nA Surprise Attack -The Falklands War \n... a series of intercepted signals ... left little doubt that an inva\u00ad\nsion was planned for the morning of Friday 2 April. \nJohn Nott, Secretary of State for Defencel \nGCHQ's intelligence about the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan \nin the last days of 1979 was excellent, but other recent surprise \nattacks and military interventions had taken the British \ncompletely unawares.2 Over the previous decade or so there \nhad been quite a few. In 1968, as we have seen, the Joint \nIntelligence Committee had spectacularly failed to predict the \nRussian invasion of Czechoslovakia and the subsequent crushing \nof the Prague Spring. Over the next ten years there had been \nother nasty surprises, including the Arab-Israeli War of 1973 \nand the Chinese attack on Vietnam in 1979. The invasion of \nAfghanistan in late 1979 and early 1980 was quickly followed \nby Soviet intervention in Poland. \nThe overall performance of British intelligence in spotting \nthese surprise attacks and military crises was at best mediocre. \nBrooks Richards, the Cabinet Intelligence Coordinator, decided \nto probe what has been called 'the dog that didn't bark'. 3 In \nother words, he wanted to know why the record of Britain's \nJIC was poor when it came to warning of military aggression.4 \nThe person he chose to investigate was Douglas NicolL a veteran \nof Bletchley Park's Hut Six.5 Working alongside Gordon \nWelchman and Stuart Milner-Barry, he had spent the Second \nWorld War puzzling over the intricate code-breaking problems \nof Enigma. After the war he was one of a minority who had \n388 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nstayed on at GCHQ, and by the early 1970s he had been in \ncharge of Z DivisioI!, which passed finished intelligence to the \ncustomers in Whitehall. Now, after half a lifetime of work at \nGCHQ, he had been given a rather different puzzle.6 \nBy late 1981 Nicoll had finished what had become a massive \nstudy of surprise attack. His findings were important. He \nconcluded that although 'provision of warning of aggression' \nwas a core duty of the JIC, it was actually ill-suited to the task, \nsince it was really a body that had been set up to produce \nstrategic estimates. In short, the problems it thought about were \nlarge and complex, and the time cycles were long. By contrast, \nwarning was really all about tactical intelligence, since aggres\u00ad\nsion was often long in the planning but short in the execution. \nMoreover, Nicoll argued that Britain's intelligence analysts \ntended to suffer from two psychological neuroses. First, they \nfound it difficult to believe that an aggressor would ever find \nthe use of force politically acceptable. They tended to think \nabout what the British would do if they were in the shoes of \ntheir enemies. In fact, the political regimes they were looking \nat were often unstable, and therefore much more inclined to \ncommit acts of violent aggression. Nicoll also identified some\u00ad\nthing that he called 'perseveration'. This was the tendency of \nintelligence analysts to come up with a view about a problem \nearly on, and then to refuse to change it. Given that intelli\u00ad\ngence officers were often asked to look at the same problem \nrepeatedly, this was a serious failing.7 \nOn 2 April 1982, only three months after the Nicoll report on \nsurprise attack had been completed, Argentina invaded the \nFalkland Islands. British intelligence manifestly failed to spot \nthis coming, and within months Nicoll had been recalled to \nmount a second inquiry that focused on the Falklands intelli\u00ad\ngence failure. Although he had been tough on Britain's intelli\u00ad\ngence analysts about their performance over the past decade, \nhe was kinder to them about the Falklands. He concluded that \nthe invasion had been very hard to detect in advance. The \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 389 \nArgentineans had caught the British by surprise because they \nlaunched their operation earlier than they had themselves \nintended, and with almost no preparation. The Argentinean \nmilitary planners had expected six months of build-up, but \nBuenos Aires had suddenly ordered a snap invasion in the space \nof just six days. There were simply no preparations to see. As \nLord Carrington, Britain's forlorn Foreign Secretary, later put \nit: 'It's all very well when you can see soldiers moving about \non the ground, but you can't see someone's intentions.'8 \nNevertheless, senior intelligence officers conceded that despite \nincreased diplomatic rumblings over the Falklands, the islands \nhad remained a 'low intelligence priority'.9 \nThe Argentinean junta that took power in a coup in 1976 \nwas, in the words of Lord Carrington, a 'brutal' one.1O Its more \nunpleasant activities included a loathsome 'Dirty War' in which \nleftists, intellectuals, trade unionists and human rights \ncampaigners 'disappeared'. The notorious Naval Mechanics \nSchool in Buenos Aires became the main torture centre, and \nmany junior officers were forced to participate in the liquida\u00ad\ntion of forty thousand of their fellow citizens. Argentinean naval \nintelligence played a leading role in the secret execution of intel\u00ad\nlectuals and union leaders, and this in turn underlined the \nstrength of the naval faction in the new junta. Invading the \nFalklands would be a predominantly naval operation, and almost \nimmediately after the coup there were worrying signs. In \nNovember 1976 the aggressive Commander in Chief of the \nArgentine Navy, Admiral Jorge Anaya, arranged for the symbolic \noccupation of the tiny uninhabited British island of Southern \nThule. More remarkably, on 22 September 1977 Anaya ordered \nthe capture of four Soviet trawlers that were fishing in Falklands \nwaters as an assertion of Argentina's sovereignty. The incident \nwas messy, with an exchange of fire and the death of one \nRussian sailor. This should have signalled that Buenos Aires was \nnow run by violent men. Argentinean death squads operated \nnot only at home but abroad. Elena Holmberg, the Argentine \nCultural Attache in Paris, compiled a dossier on the way in \n390 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nwhich Argentine naval intelligence officers were extending their \nterror operations to Europe to kill dissident Argentines there. \nSadly, she was recalled to Buenos Aires and herself secretly \nkilled in January 1979Y \nThe main impediment to the junta's Falklands ambitions had \nbeen the arrival of the highly principled Jimmy Carter in the \nWhite House in 1977. The junta had been thinking about \nrepeating the Southern Thule episode by capturing South \nGeorgia, a dependency of the Falklands and a larger island than \nThule, which London would not be able to ignore. This, the \nArgentineans believed, would allow them to negotiate from a \nposition of strength on the issue of the Falklands, which they \nhad long regarded as Argentinean territory. However, Carter \nplaced a moratorium on American arms exports to Argentina \nbecause of its horrific human rights violations. By contrast, the \nEuropeans behaved like unprincipled bagmen. The British \nrushed to sell the Argentineans some of their latest frigates, but \nwere outpaced by the Germans. The French sold them Super \nEtendard jets and the latest Exocet sea-skimming missiles. The \nItalians, Spanish and Belgians followed in their wake. All these \ncountries overlooked the disappearance of their own nationals \nin Argentina as part of the 'Dirty War': in the case of Germany, \nno fewer than forty-eight of their citizens had vanished without \ntrace. Britain secured a contract for the training of Argentinean \nspecial forces, and even supplied a hundred specially silenced \nSterling sub-machine guns. In April 1982 these elite Argentinean \ntroops were in the first wave of invaders, and infamously \ndisplayed captured British Royal Marines in front of Government \nHouse at Port Stanley, the islands' capital. 12 \nIncredibly, when the Argentinean junta seized the tiny unin\u00ad\nhabited island of Southern Thule in 1976, the Foreign Office \ncovered this up, and it was only admitted to Parliament a year \nlater. Ted Rowlands, a junior Foreign Office Minister, was sent \nto Argentina to undertake another round of appeasement. \nRowlands made pathetic pleas to Buenos Aires not to mention \nthe embarrassing Southern Thule incident publicly, resulting in \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 391 \nopen mockery from the Argentineans. By 1977 the JIC had \nlooked at the occupation of Southern Thule and concluded, \nrightly, that the Falklands were now a cause celebre for the junta, \nand that a further escapade might be on the cards. The Foreign \nSecretary, David Owen, decided that frigates and a nuclear \nsubmarine should be sent to the South Atlantic as a show of \nresolve, and the Prime Minister, James Callaghan, backed him. \nIt is widely thought that SIS was asked by Callaghan to gently \nleak the presence of this secret task force to the Argentineans \nto increase its deterrent value. \\3 \nGiven that warning of an attack on the islands would always \nbe difficult to secure, visible deterrence was critical. The most \nimportant element of the British military presence in the South \nAtlantic was a curious-looking ship called HMS Endurance, vari\u00ad\nously described as an ice-patrol ship or a survey vessel. Painted \nan indeterminate shade of reddish-orange, she was known affec\u00ad\ntionately by her crew as 'The Plum'. Armed with only a 20mm \ncannon and a helicopter, she moved around between South \nGeorgia, the Falklands and Argentina, transporting small contin\u00ad\ngents of Royal Marines and conducting scientific survey work. \nHowever, her most important role was a covert one, as her \nCaptain, Nick Barker, later explained: \n* It could be argued that the main armament of the ship \nwas the listening suite. This was a small box parked on top \nof the hangar which contained a comprehensive set of \nmonitoring equipment. It could also receive frequencies in \nmost bands at sea or on station. Our communications tech\u00ad\nnicians were Spanish linguists which meant they were well \ninformed whenever we went alongside in South America \n... The Endurance was, in effect, a listening station. The \ntwo senior ratings most concerned were known as 'The \nSpies' by the ship's company. 14 \n* As Barker recounts, it did not take the Argentineans long to \nrealise that the curious boxes on the roof of the hangar contained \n392 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nsomething slightly more exciting than brooms for sweeping \ndown the decks. Sir Anthony Williams, Britain's Ambassador to \nBuenos Aires later explained that Endurance was not only \nlistening to Argentina, but was gathering signals intelligence \nfrom throughout South AmericaY Much of Cheltenham's best \nmaterial on Argentina came from the Endurance. However, the \nThule incident had also prompted GCHQ to revive its small \nstation on Ascension Island off the west coast of Africa, which \nhad only been closed down the year before. The cover for this \nactivity was the small settlement called TWo Boats, which nomi\u00ad\nnally belonged to Cable & Wireless Ltd.16 \nIn 1980 an unsuspecting Foreign Office Minister, Nicholas \nRidley, was lured by pro-Argentinean British diplomats into trying \nto transfer the islands' sovereignty by stealth. The idea was that \nthe Falklands would quietly be given to the Argentineans, but \nthen leased back from them by Britain for a number of years. \nRidley tried valiantly to sell the idea of 'leaseback' to the islanders, \nbut they were not impressed, and wished to remain British \nsubjects. In December 1980 he expounded the plan to the House \nof Commons, and walked into a well-prepared ambush by the \nFalklands lobby. He was subjected to a wilting attack from all \nsides, denouncing what they called the Foreign Office's 'shameful \nschemes' . 17 Nonetheless, curious conspiracies were still going on \nin Whitehall a year later. When Admiral Fieldhouse, the new \nCommander in Chief of the Fleet, took over in 1981, he recalls \nrepeatedly asking about contingency plans for the defence of the \nFalklands. The Foreign Office told him there was no need, as \n'they were negotiating and could handle it' .18 More alarmingly, \nHMS Endurance was scheduled to be withdrawn in late 1981 \nbecause of defence cuts. Argentina had detected that the civil \nservants of Whitehall were not anxious to defend the Falklands, \nbut it was equally clear that a negotiated solution would never \nget past the House of Commons. For the Argentineans, the only \nlogical answer was now invasion. The person who was most \naware of the developing crisis was the man on the spot, Sir \nAnthony Williams, Britain's Ambassador in Buenos Aires. He had \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 393 \nbeen anxious about the Falklands for some time, and in the \nautumn of 1981 had sent 'a very much more acute warning' to \nthe Foreign Office. However, London was not persuaded: 'They \nwere by no means convinced that my information was neces\u00ad\nsarily better than what they were getting through ... the inter\u00ad\nception of Argentina's diplomatic cypher traffic by Government \nCommunications Headquarters:19 \nIn fact, Argentinean orders to prepare for the invasion of the \nFalklands were given secretly by word of mouth. On the sunny \nmorning of Tuesday, 15 December 1981, Admiral Anaya flew \ninto Puerto Belgrano, which served as the main centre of oper\u00ad\nations for the Argentine Navy. His presence there was seem\u00ad\ningly ceremonial: he had arrived to oversee the installation of \nthe new Chief of Naval Operations, Vice Admiral Juan Lombardo. \nBands played, sailors paraded and were inspected, everything \npassed off faultlessly. However, a surprise awaited Lombardo. A \nfew hours after the parade, Anaya asked to speak to him alone. \nTo his amazement he was ordered to prepare for the invasion \nof the Falklands. Absolute secrecy, Anaya emphasised, was para\u00ad\nmount.20 In mid-January 1982 the Army and the Air Force were \ntold, and by early March the outline planning for invasion was \nready. The target date was mid-September, following the abate\u00ad\nment of the foul South Atlantic winter weather, between April \nand August. The 2nd Marine Infantry Battalion, which was to \nlead the invasion, began quietly exercising on the coast of \nPatagonia, using a beach that resembled that of Port Stanley. \nOnly a handful of their officers knew the real purpose of the \nexercises, and radio silence ensured that it was not picked up \nby GCHQ.21 \nBizarrely, the British now triggered an earlier than scheduled \ninvasion of the Falklands, and so, in a way, inflicted surprise \nupon themselves. During March 1982 a minor incident occurred \non South Georgia, which was also claimed by Argentina. A \ngroup of Argentine scrap-metal workers had been contracted \nto remove some old machinery from an abandoned whale factory \non the island. During their visit they raised an Argentinean flag, \n394 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nand refused to seek a landing permit. The British Foreign \nSecretary, Lord Carrington, repeatedly insisted on their removal, \nand despatched HMS Endurance, with a party of twenty Royal \nMarines, from the Falklands. This was reported to Buenos Aires, \nwhich sent a similar-sized ship, the Bahia Paraios, with a small \nparty of troops. By the end of March two armed parties, \nLilliputian in size, were on South Georgia, twenty miles apart. \nCrucially, this minor confrontation accelerated the invasion of \nthe Falklands. The junta now ordered immediate action. \nArgentinean military officers had almost no time to prepare the \ninvasion, and British intelligence had few preparations to \nobserve.22 \nThe Argentinean junta saw South Georgia as a crisis. The \nremoval of the scrap men by force would be an unbearable \nslight to their prestige, yet they would not be ready for mili\u00ad\ntary action against the British for months. All crises consist of \nboth danger and opportunity. In the end, Buenos Aires decided \nto seize the opportunity, and used the confrontation over South \nGeorgia as a pretext to launch a snap invasion of the Falklands. \nOn 23 March the planning group was asked how quickly they \ncould produce a detailed scheme for invasion. Their answer was \nearly April, but they were told to be ready to sail on 28 March. \nAir Vice Commodore Carlos Bloomer- Reeve, who was to become \nSecretary General of the new Argentinean administration on \nwhat they called the 'Islas Malvinas', was only told of his role \non 27 March.H The extreme short notice helped to defeat sigint. \nOne of GCHQ's key indicators of a possible invasion was that \nintelligence analysts had identified a number of Argentine mili\u00ad\ntary units as likely participants, and their signals were tracked \nas warning features. Among these indicator units were elite \narmy formations along the border with Chile.24 While they \nremained there, so orthodoxy maintained, an invasion could \nnot be under way. Rather like the Israelis in 1973, who had a \nmodel of what forces the Egyptians would need to assemble if \nthey planned an invasion, GCHQ also had a fixed concept. \nInstead, the initial operations were carried out almost entirely \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 395 \nby the Argentinean Navy and Marines. Meanwhile the crack \narmy units remained on the Chilean border.25 \nAt sea, both the Argentineans and the Chileans were engaged \nin large-scale exercises, resulting in a cacophony of signals from \ndozens of ships, all seemingly 'on operations'. 26 In fact sigint \ncontributed to British confusion. Reports received around 24 \nMarch indicated that two Argentine warships had been sent to \nintercept HMS Endurance, then making its way to South Georgia \nwith Marines. It was this sigint material that triggered a discus\u00ad\nsion of the situation on South Georgia in Whitehall on Thursday, \n25 March. The Defence Secretary, John Nott, who had been \naway in Washington, saw the same material over the weekend, \nand went to see the First Sea Lord, Henry Leach, about it early \non the following Monday morning. GCHQ had picked up a \nsignal from Admiral Anaya in Buenos Aires ordering two \nArgentinean frigates, Drummond and Granville, to sail south to \nreinforce the Bahia Paraios and its small party of Marines on \nSouth Georgia. In fact Admiral Lombardo objected to this move, \ninsisting that he needed the frigates for the main operation \nagainst the Falklands, so they were recalled. However, such is \nthe power of sigint in painting the picture for commanders that \nmost British accounts, including Nott's own precise memoir, still \ninsist that these ships went to South Georgia. Oddly, a deploy\u00ad\nment that never actually occurred now began the slide towards \nwar.27 \nOver the weekend of 27-28 March, the British Ambassador \nin Buenos Aires was told by the Argentines that South Georgia \nwas now a 'closed issue', and would not be discussed further. \nThis ominous sign was accompanied by general instructions to \nArgentinean embassies around the world to cancel all leave. All \nthis was collected by GCHQ. The JIC still believed in a model \nof gradually escalating tension, and did not think the crisis over \nSouth Georgia would have immediate implications for the \nFalklands. However, GCHQ maintained its long-established prac\u00ad\ntice of selecting choice items of raw intelligence for Downing \nStreet, known as the Blue Book. This was a favourite with \n396 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nMargaret Thatcher, who loved intelligence, despite the fact that \nher staff referred to these reports rather sneeringly as 'Comic \nCuts'.28 When she and Carrington saw the raw sigint on South \nGeorgia, their gut instincts were much better than those of the \nintelligence analysts. Conversing over the phone on the evening \nof 28 March, and again on an aircraft that took them to a \nsummit in Brussels on Monday, 29 March, they decided to send \nthree nuclear submarines south immediately. At this point the \nfocus of British anxiety still seems to have been South Georgia. \nHowever, to Carrington's credit, these submarines were sailing \nsouth within perhaps three days of the moment at which the \njunta had decided to invade.29 \nIn the two weeks between the arrival of the scrap-metal workers \nand the invasion of the Falklands, much of the intelligence mate\u00ad\nrial pouring in was low-grade naval sigint collected by Endurance. \nBecause of John Nott's attempts to trim the British fleet in 1981, \nEndurance had been earmarked for retirement. Therefore her \nwarnings of increasing Argentine bellicosity, based on the inter\u00ad\nception of low-level operational traffic, were dismissed by some \nas an effort to save the ship from being withdrawn from service.3D \nWorking under the JIC were several Current Intelligence Groups \ncovering different regions. The Group covering Latin America, \nheaded by Brigadier Adam Gurdon, thought the material was \nnot very definitive. Something was going on, but the vast volume \nof low-grade naval traffic was confusing. Key elements of the \nArgentine Army were still on the border with Chile. Moreover, \nthe momentum seemed less than in 1977, when the JIC had \nsounded the alarm but no attack had taken place. So for the time \nbeing they watched and waited.31 What Douglas Nicoll had called \n'perseveration' was also in evidence. The intelligence analysts \nrehearsed the familiar line on the Falklands that invasion would \nnot occur suddenly, but would follow a gradual increase in diplo\u00ad\nmatic pressure by Buenos Aires. Moreover, the gathering tempo \nof the Cold War, with fighting in Afghanistan and then trouble \nin Poland, took their attention elsewhere. Over a two-year period \nbetween November 1977 and November 1979, the JIC had \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 397 \nreviewed the situation in the Falklands eight times. However, \nover the next two and a half years, between November 1979 and \nMarch 1982, it revisited the threat to the islands only three times.32 \nOn Wednesday, 31 March 1982, sigint finally picked up unam\u00ad\nbiguous signs of a Falklands invasion at two days' notice. GCHQ \nintercepted a message to the Argentine submarine Santa Fe, \nwhich was landing a special forces reconnaissance team on the \nbeach at Mullett Creek on the Falklands. There was only one \npossible interpretation that could be placed on this -invasion \nwas very close. This unpleasant news was flashed to the Cabinet \nOffice.33 During that morning there had also been a very rapid \nrise in the volume of signals traffic. Suddenly, it was hard to \nescape the conclusion that an invasion fleet was mustering off \nthe Falklands. By the same afternoon a crash assessment had \nreached John Nott's desk, but he was busy in the House of \nCommons.34 At 6 o'clock in the evening, Nott still had 'no \nconception' that a major crisis was about to unfold. However, \naware that there were problems, he had asked a team from the \nDefence Intelligence Staff to come to his room in the House of \nCommons to give him a briefing: \n* They then produced a series of intercepted signals and other \nintelligence which left little doubt that an invasion was \nplanned for the morning of Friday 2 April. We knew four \nthings: that an Argentine submarine had been deployed to \nthe area around Port Stanley ... That the Argentine fleet, \nwhich had been on exercises, had broken up into smaller \nunits and seemed to be reassembling for an invasion, that \nan army commander had been embarked separately on a \nmerchant ship and seemed likely to be the commander of \nan amphibious force; and finally that the fleet had been \nordered to destroy all its documents.35 \n* Sigint might not have given early warning of Argentinean inten-\ntions, but now the invasion was under way, it rendered every\u00ad\nthing horribly transparent. This triggered action. Nott asked to \n398 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nsee the Prime Minister immediately in her room in the \nCommons. An informal meeting of Ministers and Permanent \nUnder-Secretaries gathered to discuss initial reactions. Margaret \nThatcher recalls that the sigint from GCHQ was extremely \ncompelling, and there was 'no ground to question the intelli\u00ad\ngence'.36 She sent Ronald Reagan a message, 'asking whether \nhe was aware of the Signals intelligence that we had just \nreceived'. David Omand, Nott's private secretary, was sent to \nsee if the material from GCHQ had yet been forwarded to NSA. \n'At this early stage it had not.'37 \nJust before the meeting broke up, Henry Leach, the First Sea \nLord, arrived outside the Prime Minister's room asking to see \nNott. They invited him in to join the proceedings . .He entered \nin full uniform, making an immediate impression on the Prime \nMinister, who recalls it as a moment of 'comedy' in an other\u00ad\nwise dark episode.38 Thatcher asked him for his views. With \n'supreme self-confidence and assertiveness' he explained that \nmuch of the British fleet just happened to be exercising off \nGibraltar. It would be possible to send a large task force within \na week. He predicted that the Argentines would flee at the sight \nof the White Ensign. Could he have permission? Thatcher \nacceded immediately and with visible relief.39 She already knew \nthat her government was in very serious trouble, and the \nshowing of her Ministers in the ensuing emergency debates did \nnothing to dispel the general air of incompetence.4o John Major, \na backbencher at the time, recalls that an angry House of \nCommons was close to 'mob rule' and was febrile with 'rumours \nthat the Foreign Office had received the plans of the invasion \ndays earlier'.41 Many have concluded that if the risky decision \nto send the Task Force had not been taken, the Thatcher govern\u00ad\nment would not have survivedY \nOn Thursday, 1 April, further sigint arrived from GCHQ. The \nArgentine forces had been ordered to rendezvous off the \nFalklands at 6 o'clock the next morning, confirming the inva\u00ad\nsion date of 2 April suggested in earlier interceptsY How was \nGCHQ reading the Argentinean communications with such ease? \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 399 \nThe Clnswer was quite simple. Some of Argentina's high-grade \nmilitary and diplomatic communications systems made use of \nexpensive but thoroughly compromised European cypher \nmachines, while some Argentinean military field units employed \nAmerican-manufactured systems which were also vulnerable; \noddly, their medium-grade traffic sometimes took longer to \nbreak.44 NSA also had the capability to read Argentine traffic, \nbut was not giving it any priority due to its focus on Russia and \nChina. In late April, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, who was just \ncompleting his tour as Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency (and who had been Director of NSA under Carter), \nexplained the situation. US technical intelligence in Germany \nwas now so good that a Russian surprise attack there was all \nbut impossible. But, Inman insisted, Washington did not have \n'foreknowledge of the Argentine government's intention to \ninvade the Falklands Islands'. It just did not have enough staff \nto follow global trends, so in remoter areas it often did 'very \npoorly'.45 In Britain, a number of senior ex-Ministers, including \nDenis Healey, who had taken a close interest in intelligence over \nthe years, suspected that the Americans had known about the \nArgentinean invasion in advance. Antony Duff, who had \nreplaced Richard Brooks as the new Cabinet Office Intelligence \nCoordinator, was busy giving private assurances to these indi\u00ad\nviduals that this was not the case.46 \nGCHQ was now expecting a sigint bonanza. With Argentinean \nmilitary operations rolling along, Cheltenham hoped that their \nreadable communications, together with avid collection by \nfriends and allies, would render their opponent an open book. \nThey had not reckoned on Ted Rowlands, Labour MP for Clwyd, \nwho had led the embarrassing negotiation mission to Argentina \nin 1977 as junior Foreign Office Minister. During his period in \noffice he had been privy to sigint decrypts of Argentinean traffic. \nThe word 'privy' is used advisedly, since he was now a Privy \nCouncillor, a role to which special discretion is attached. \nHowever, in the heat of the Falklands debate in April 1982, he \nchose to blurt out all he knew about sigint. Anxious to extract \n400 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nmaximum political advantage, he insisted that the invasion could \nnot have been a surprise. 'I shall make disclosure,' he said rather \npompously. 'As well as trying to read the mind of the enemy, \nwe have been reading its telegrams for many years.'47 \nThe gasps of horror in the House of Commons were audible. \nThe groans of agony were even louder at Cheltenham. No \nMember of Parliament had committed such a public sigint gaffe \nsince Stanley Baldwin had infamously baited the Russians by \nreading out their own cypher traffic in the House of Commons \nin 1927. Margaret Thatcher later said that the Rowlands blunder \nhad been 'totally and utterly devastating in the amount which \nit gave away to those against whom intelligence was directed', \nadding, 'The moment you say too much the sources dry Up.'48 \nWhat was the cost of the Rowlands security gaffe? Some have \nargued that it was so great that some major reverses of the \nFalklands War, such as the attack on the Sir Galahad at Bluff \nCove, might have been averted had Rowlands kept his mouth \nshut.49 The reality seems to be that while the Argentineans may \nhave improved their cypher security, their material became \nharder to break, rather than unbreakable. They improved their \nprocedures, changed their codes more frequently and in some \ncases double encyphered, but to little avail, since their actual \nmachines were compromised. Commander Robert Denton \nGreen, who was the Intelligence Officer at Fleet Headquarters \nin Northwood, offers the best assessment: \n* But amid all this difficulty, GCHQ managed to break the \nArgentine codes. They were not terribly sophisticated, \nbut we got a lot of very high quality political and battle\u00ad\nplanning intelligence. It took us between twelve and \ntwemy-four hours to decipher and translate the messages, \nso we were always trying to extrapolate forward to see \nwhat they meant for us now. \n* Denton Green concludes that although the material was some-\ntimes ambiguous, GCHQ intercepts gave it a reasonable picture \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 401 \nof what was going on inside the minds of the main Argentine \ncommanders. By contrast, the GCHQ material on the political \nside was 'a little bit confusing', but this reflected the genuine \nturbulence within the ruling circles in Buenos Aires at the time. \nSome of the delay was caused by the challenge of sifting through \nthe vast volume of messages that were intercepted and deciding \nwhat was usefuPo The Argentinean Air Force's traffic was the \nhardest to read, since it had recently invested in new encrypted \ncommunications made by a subsidiary of the British defence \ncompany Racal, based in South Africa.51 One of the most irri\u00ad\ntating aspects of the Rowlands affair for GCHQ was that other \ncountries in the Southern Hemisphere took the hint and set \nabout improving their own cypher facilities. 52 \nAs the Task Force headed south, intelligence activities by other \ninterested parties presented awkward questions. What should \nbe done about the ever-present Soviet spy trawlers, 'bristling \nwith radio antennae', that followed the Task Force?53 Overhead, \nthey were watched by vast Russian TO-20D 'Bear' elint recon\u00ad\nnaissance aircraft, with a range of eleven thousand miles, while \nGCHQ soon reported that the Russians had launched extra satel\u00ad\nlites to watch the spectacle. 54 Remarkably, throughout the \nconflict the Norwegian signals intelligence base located at Fauske \nin the far north regularly intercepted the Soviet satellite intel\u00ad\nligence data. This was then sent direct to the British, who used \nit to find the Argentinean fleet. One British intelligence officer \nrecalls: 'When the war broke out, we ourselves almost didn't \nhave any intelligence information from this area. It was here \nwe got help from the Norwegians, who gave us a stream of \ninformation about the Argentine warships' positions. The infor\u00ad\nmation came to us all the time and straight to our war head\u00ad\nquarters at Northwood. The information was continuously \nupdated and told us exactly where the Argentine ships were.' \nMeanwhile, the Soviets passed nothing on to Argentina.55 \nIn early April, Britain's intelligence analysts were playing \ncatch-up. One of the areas in which sigint offers huge bene\u00ad\nfits is its ability to build up a picture of the enemy's order of \n402 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nbattle, including the size of each unit, its position and the \nextent to which it is mobile. Partly because of the difficulties \nwith high-grade Russian sigint during the Cold War, GCHQ \nand the sigint elements of the three services had devoted vast \neffort to mapping every subsection of Warsaw Pact forces. \nHowever, this sort of activity is time-consuming and labour\u00ad\nintensive. Armies of listeners are required to shadow the real \narmies on the ground. No such effort had been devoted to the \narmed forces of Argentina, and their order of battle was a \nmystery. Thus, on 4 April 1982, when Major General Julian \nThompson, the Royal Marines commander, looked to his \nBrigade Intelligence Officer, Vivian Rowe, for a briefing about \nthe three thousand Argentine troops, the main source of intel\u00ad\nligence was reference books in Plymouth Public Library. 56 Things \ndid not look much better in the Defence Intelligence Staff in \nLondon, which had little material on the Argentinean order of \nbattle. Eventually it found a British naval officer who followed \nthe Argentinean forces as a hobby. 57 Later, the CIA and Chile \nhanded over their own order of battle materials on Argentina, \nwhich were complete.58 \nMeanwhile, Cheltenham had set up an operations room, \npresided over by Rod Little of K Division, the section of GCHQ \nthat specialised in non-Russian co mint, in one of the unpre\u00ad\npossessing single-storey spurs on the main site at Oakley. In a \nroom nearby, elint was presided over by the head of J Division, \nMichael Herman, who had vast experience of airborne signals \ncollection. 59 One of the biggest problems was forward distribu\u00ad\ntion of the product. At the Fleet Headquarters at Northwood, \nCommander Robert Denton Green had secure communications \ngiving him an excellent feed of material from both GCHQ and \nNSA. However, the abiding Cold War mindset had resulted in \nlittle attention being given to the ability to push sigint forward \nto operational commanders, especially during expeditionary \noperations in far-flung locations. The main connection between \nGCHQ and Commander Sandy Woodward's flagship in the South \nAtlantic, the aircraft carrier HMS Hermes, was a secure encrypted \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 403 \ntelephone link using Skynet, which allowed the operations room \nat Cheltenham to talk directly to the intelligence officers on the \nship. However, distribution to lower levels was more difficult. \nAs Denton Green observed, the Falklands War was 'very strange', \nand many arrangements had to be improvised.60 \nA set of bizarre circumstances soon made communications yet \nmore difficult. In common with many British government agen\u00ad\ncies in the 1980s, GCHQ was now required to outsource its \nbuilding maintenance rather than relying on a local workforce. \nSome weeks into the Falklands War, a gang of contractors \nappeared outside the Falklands operations room in Cheltenham \nand announced that they had come to resurface the roof. In \ntimes gone by they would have been sent away with a flea in \ntheir ear, but this would now involve hefty cancellation charges. \nSo, with the nerve centre of sigint operations operating below, \nthe labourers began work on the roof of the single-storey office \nbuilding, ripping off the old felt, spreading fresh sealant and \nrecovering. Vats of boiling tar surrounded the hapless sigint \nteams. As late spring turned to early summer the temperature \nrose, but the windows could not be opened. The tar men were \nnot cleared for comint, or indeed any kind of 'int'. For a week, \nconversations with HMS Hermes were hilarious. The intelligence \nofficer on Woodward's staff would say, 'Hang on, I can't hear \nyou. Some Harriers are just taking off!' Cheltenham would reply, \n'Well, we can't hear you either, there's too much banging on \nthe roof!'61 \nDuring late April, even as the Task Force headed south, \nGeneral Alexander Haig, Reagan's Secretary of State, had been \nengaged in a slightly comic reprise of Kissinger's famous 1970s \n'Shuttle Diplomacy'. Presenting himself to Margaret Thatcher \nas an honest broker, he had been subjected to a severe tongue\u00ad\nlashing by the Prime Minister, in which she made ready compar\u00ad\nisons between the military dictators in Buenos Aires and Adolf \nHitler. Despite her obvious vexations at American attempts to \nplay the honest broker, Thatcher entered into the diplomatic \nexchanges in good faith. Rather to her relief, on 19 April the \n404 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nArgentinean government rejected Haig's latest peace plan. \nRonald Reagan nov!' reluctantly terminated Haig's mission, \ndeclaring American support for Britain. Britain announced a \ntwo-hundred-mile Exclusion Zone around the Falklands. On 1 \nMay the RAF launched the first long-range Vulcan bomber raid \non Stanley airport. On the same day, Sea Harriers attacked Goose \nGreen and three Argentinean aircraft were brought down. The \ntalking was over and the shooting war had begun. \nOn 2 May, the most controversial action of the war occurred \nwhen the Argentine cruiser General Belgrano was sunk by the \nBritish nuclear attack submarine HMS Conqueror. The Belgrano \nwas a large cruiser accompanied by destroyers, and the British \nwere anxious about losing track of her as she headed towards \nthe Exclusion Zone. Her main threat was her powerful radar, \nwhich could detect the British fleet at long range, while the fire\u00ad\npower actually lay with the Exocet-carrying destroyers that \naccompanied her. The Belgrano group constituted a serious danger \nto the Task Force, and was therefore being shadowed by the \nConqueror under Commander Christopher Wreford-Brown, who \nhad arrived on the submarine only a few weeks previously. The \nAdmiralty requested a change to the rules of engagement to \nallow an attack on the cruiser while she was outside the Exclusion \nZone, and the War Cabinet gave its approval at 10 o'clock in \nthe morning. This had not been given lightly. Willie Whitelaw, \nthe Deputy Prime Minister, asked what many regarded as the \nkey question. If the Conqueror was asked merely to shadow the \nBelgrano group for the time being, could she be certain to main\u00ad\ntain contact? The answer was an emphatic 'no'. In fact, the \nConqueror had previously been shadowing the Argentine aircraft \ncarrier 25 Mayo, but had lost contact during bad weather.62 \nEven while this fraught discussion was going on, the Belgrano \ngroup changed course and, gently zig-zagging, began heading \naway from the Falklands. At 1.30 in the afternoon the Conqueror \nrose and accessed the satellite, which gave her the changed \nrules of engagement and permission to attack. Choosing old\u00ad\nfashioned Mark 8 torpedoes of a Second World War vintage, \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 405 \nWreford-Brown had to manoeuvre to within less than two miles \nof the Beigrana. This took until 6.30 p.m. At the last moment he \nthought he had misjudged the approach. Peering through the \nperiscope, he muttered. 'Damn. Too close: But after a few seconds' \nhesitation he fired three torpedoes. Less than a minute later, the \nfirst torpedo hit the Beigrana just ahead of the front gun turret. \nA massive flash lit up the sky, and the explosion nearly blew the \nentire bow of the ship uff. The Beigrana was already doomed \nwhen the second torpedo slammed home. The third also found \nits mark, but failed to explode. The Beigrana was sunk thirty miles \noutside the Exclusion Zone, and 386 Argentine sailors perished. \nBy the following day, all Argentinean naval vessels had been \nrecalled to within a few miles of the coast.63 \nSigint bears strongly on the Beigrana story. During the conflict, \nand for some years afterward, Margaret Thatcher was severely \ncriticised for permitting the attack outside the Exclusion Zone. \nIt now seems that the key signals intelligence concerning this \ncontroversial action reached British commanders and politicians \nin London after the faCIo Events turned largely upon a sequence \nof Argentine Navy signals that were intercepted and read by \nGCHQ. On 1 May 1982 the Argentine Navy was told to locate \nthe British Task Force around the Falklands and launch a \n'massive attack' as soon as possible. The Beigrana was ordered \nsouth and into the Exclusion Zone. This alarming signal was \nintercepted by GCHQ, and strongly informed the government's \ndeliberations. Shortly afterwards, the War Cabinet met at the \nPrime Minister's country residence, Chequers, and authorised \nan attack on the Beigrana. Sigint showed that, although at this \nmoment she still lay outside the Exclusion Zone, her orders \nwere clear, and she constituted a serious threat. Later, further \nintercepted signals revealed that the Argentinean military chiefs \nhad ordered the Beigrana to reverse course and resume her \nprevious position, probably because she had been spotted by \nBritish aircraft. However, as we have seen, Argentinean traffic \ntook some time to process, and the new intercepts were not \ndistributed on the British side until the following day, and so \n406 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nhad no impact on the day's events.64 Accusations were later \nmade that Thatcher pursued this action in order to 'torpedo' an \nAmerican-backed Peruvian peace plan. It is now clear that the \nBelgrano was sunk for operational rather than political reasons.65 \nThe Argentineans were not slow to respond. They deployed \ntheir French-built Super Etendard jets equipped with an air\u00ad\nlaunched version of the massive anti -ship missile, the Exocet. \nAlmost everything that British intelligence thought it knew \nabout Argentine use of this system was wrong. The naval oper\u00ad\nations staff in Whitehall had been assured that the Argentinean \nExocets were not ready to be deployed.66 Although Britain knew \nthe Argentines only had five missiles, they believed there was \nonly one launch aircraft, when in fact there were five. The Task \nForce had been told the range of the aircraft was only 425 miles, \nbut this did not take into account the possibility of mid-air \nrefuelling. Thus, on 4 May, when the British detected an \nArgentine Neptune surveillance aircraft, they did not realise that \nit was helping to guide the attacking aircraft, and dismissed it \nas a search aircraft looking for survivors from the Belgrano. Only \nwhen two Etendards approached the Task Force, and rose slightly \nto acquire their targets with their radar, was the alert sounded. \nHMS Glasgow and HMS Coventry had mere seconds to respond, \nbut escaped by firing large clouds of aluminium chaff, which \ndeflected the missiles. However, twenty miles away, for reasons \nthat are still obscure, HMS Sheffield had her radar turned off, \nand did not hear the warnings from her sister ships. Seconds \nlater she was hit in the forward engine compartment by an \nExocet. 67 The missile failed to explode, but the ship was still \ndestroyed by its force and its remaining propellant. Twenty \nmembers of the crew died. Everyone had known that the lack \nof air cover was the Achilles heel of the Task Force, and indeed, \nfor this very reason some in the Cabinet had privately thought \nthat its despatch was 'ludicrous'.68 \nIt was public knowledge that Argentina had only a limited \nnumber of Exocets, and several remarkable operations were \nnow launched to reduce their effectiveness. First of all, warning \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 407 \nwas needed of when the Exocet-armed Super Etendard jet \nfighters took off. This meant deploying special forces inside \nArgentina. Robert Denton Green recalls: 'The idea was to get a \nguy onto the runway to tell us whenever aircraft took off. It \nworked, to a certain extent, but was very hit and miss.'69 Second, \nthe French were persuaded to hand over the technical details \nand elint profiles of the missiles. Most importantly, SIS launched \nan operation to prevent more missiles being bought on the open \nmarket. Roberto Calvi, an Italian banker who aided a global \nArgentinean effort to procure more Exocets, ended up dead \nunder Blackfriar~ Bridge in June 1982.70 Calvi was also the \nbanker to the Papacy in Rome, and had Mafia connections. We \nnow know a little more about this murky subject. David Fischer, \nan American diplomat, claims to have met the man who killed \nCalvi sitting on a toilet in a restaurant in Rome clutching an \nAK-47. This improbable figure was an ex-Mafia hitman who \nhad been developed as an American agent during the hunt for \na kidnapped commander of American forces in Italy, General \nJames Dozier. By 1982 he was clearly a confirmed CIA asset, \nsuggesting that the Americans were perhaps assisting SIS on \nthe ground in their anti-Exocet campaign.71 \nMeanwhile, in the South Atlantic, there was a concerted effort \nto degrade any Argentine intelligence systems. Typically, there \nwere suspicions about an Argentine trawler called the Narwal \nwhich was shadowing the Task Force and which appeared to \nbe a sigint spy trawler. Eventually Admiral Woodward ordered \nCaptain Jeremy Black, the commander of the carrier HMS \nInvincible, to go and capture her. After careful reconnaissance \nshe was attacked with cannon fire by two Harriers in the hope \nof disabling her. When she failed to stop, a thousand-pound \nbomb was dropped, which failed to detonate. After more cannon \nfire the trawler was stopped, and slowly began to sink. \nHelicopters were despatched with an SBS boarding party. \nAlthough the Narwal had indeed been gathering intelligence, \nshe was not a sophisticated 'elint trawler' of the Russian type. \nShe had once been a normal fishing vesseL and had been \n408 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \ncommandeered by Lieutenant Commander Gonzales Llanos of \nthe Argentinean Navy at pistol point. The twenty-four fish\u00ad\nermen on board, one of whom had been killed in the Harrier \nattack, were a rather miserable press-ganged crew. Llanos was \nabout to throw his intelligence materials overboard, but was \nwarned sternly by the SBS party that if he did so, he would \nfollow them into the ocean. Captain Black was relieved to hear \nthat an Argentinean intelligence officer had been captured on \nboard, complete with all his files, codes and equipment, making \nthe operation what Woodward called 'a fair COp'.72 \nThree weeks Earlier in the conflict, the British had a much \nnarrower squeak with an Argentinean military Boeing 707 \nreconnaissance plane. Decked out in Argentinean Air Force \nregalia, it was presumed to be the equivalent of a Nimrod sigint \naircraft. On 21 April it was buzzed by a Harrier, but could not \nbe shot down because the fleet was not yet in the Exclusion \nZone. Nicknamed 'the Burglar', this aircraft was a daily visitor, \nand a cause of some anxiety. Woodward was given permission \nvia the Skynet secure phone to shoot it down if he was close \nand had positive identification. Three days later, after more \nunwelcome visits the British achieved a good lock-on with the \nradar of their Sea Dart missile system. Woodward recalls that \nthe aircraft approached at 350 knots, and within two minutes \nwould be within the permitted range for shootdown -'At which \npoint he is ours.' But with twenty seconds to spare Woodward \nyelled 'Weapons tight!', withdrawing permission to fire. It was \nnot 'the Burglar' but a Brazilian airliner running from Durban \nto Rio de Janeiro. On 3 July 1988 the American cruiser USS \nVincennes infamously shot down an Iranian airliner bound for \nDubai over the Gulf, mistaking it for an attacking fighter aircraft \nand killing all 290 people on board. The British had been only \ninches from a similar disaster.73 \nSpecial operations to prepare a path for British amphibious \nlandings on the islands began on 20 May. The initial landings \nwere destined for San Carlos Water, a calm inlet on East Falkland. \nHowever, the narrow entrance to the inlet was commanded by \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 409 \na steep bluff called Fanning Head that offered a superb vantage \nof the surrounding area. Sigint had intercepted orders for an \nArgentine heavy weapons company with 105mm guns and \nmortars to move into the area. The exact location was uncer\u00ad\ntain, because the sigint operatives were still puzzling over the \nway in which the Argentines transmitted their map references. \nLater in the campaign, sigint was brought together with captured \nmaps marked up in pen, obtained from prisoners of war, that \nresolved the mystery.74 On the night of 20 Mayan operation \nwas launched using the SBS to find and neutralise the heavy \nweapons unit. They would be accompanied by a Royal Marine \nnaval gunfire controller, Captain Hugh McManners, who would \ndirect shellfire from HMS Antrim onto the edge of the enemy \npositions. When they judged that the Argentineans had had \nenough, another officer, Captain Rod Bell, who spoke excellent \nSpanish, would call on them to surrender using a loudspeaker.7s \nThis rather elaborate plan was concocted in the wake of the \nrecent surrender of Argentine forces on South Georgia, and \nreflected the fact that British commanders now believed that \nmuch of the garriso!l would probably give up without a fight, \nif offered the option. The plan was to insert the SBS party from \nAntrim by night, using two helicopters. However, the operation \nwas complicated by the fact that the sigint pointed to three \npossible enemy locations that were quite widely dispersed. To \ndeal with this, a preliminary reconnaissance flight was under\u00ad\ntaken by a modified Wessex helicopter with a newly installed \nthermal image camera -so new in fact that the crew were still \nreading the manual. The helicopter was a rather improbable\u00ad\nlooking beast, earning it the nickname 'Humphrey'. During this \nmission all the occupants, who included the SBS commander \nand McManners, were nervous because a Sea King helicopter \nhad just been lost at sea with eighteen members of the SAS. \nHowever, the new equipment worked perfectly, 'vacuuming up' \nthermal images~ first picking up the bungalows of the settle\u00ad\nment at the far end of the San Carlos inlet and eventually \nrevealing the Argentine heavy weapons company as a cluster \n410 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nof 'bright green glow worms'. They returned to brief the whole \npatrol, which departed an hour later in two helicopters so heavily \nladen that they struggled to get airborne. \nThe excessive weight was caused by the fact that every second \nmember of the thirty-man SBS fighting patrol carried a belt\u00ad\nfeed General Purpose Machine Gun, in the hope that this massive \nfirepower, together with tracer ammunition, would allow them \nto pretend to be a much bigger force than they really were. By \nthe time the patrol approached Fanning Head, the Argentine \nheavy weapons company were already firing their artillery out \nto sea. McManners immediately called in a heavy barrage from \nAntrim which consisted of twenty salvoes set as airbursts, \nexploding fifty feet above the ground. The massive explosions \nturned night into day, and the Argentine guns quickly fell silent. \nMcManners then called in sporadic rounds to keep the position \nbusy while his patrol advanced. But Captain Bell's loudspeaker \nfailed, and efforts to persuade the remaining enemy to surrender \nwere only partly effective. With dawn fast approaching, an inter\u00ad\nmittent fire fight developed, vast clouds of tracer bullets skim\u00ad\nming towards the {'nemy. Fanning Head was soon secure, and \nthe SBS patrol made its way down to the beach to watch the \nmain landing force heading up San Carlos Water towards its \nlanding points. Overhead, Argentine aircraft had already begun \nto attack the landing ships and their escorts, extracting a high \ncost. Mirage jets from the Argentine Air Force streaked by the \nSBS patrol, only fifty feet above the water.76 \nIt was now the morning of 21 May, and the troubled land\u00ad\nings at San Carlos Water began in earnest. Brigadier Julian \nThompson had arranged for a diversionary attack to be put in \nby D Squadron of the SAS at Darwin and Goose Green, where \nthere were large concentrations of Argentine troops. These \nparties were able to call in gunfire from HMS Ardent and HMS \nGlamorgan to make their attack look serious: 'Signals intercept \ntraffic afterwards revealed that the Argentineans believed they \nwere under attack from the main force, which was our inten\u00ad\ntion:77 Sigint continued to be fed in a steady stream to Admiral \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 411 \nWoodward on Hermes, and informed the air and naval war. \nHowever, once Brigadier Thompson and his 3 Commando \nBrigade HQ were ashore at San Carlos, it was harder to get \nsigint to the land forces. Remarkably, because of its highly clas\u00ad\nsified nature, some information was withheld from Thompson's \nintelligence staff, so initially they had difficulty figuring out \nArgentinean strengths and positions. The withheld information \nwas mostly sigint, and the authorities were adamant that it \ncould not be released.78 \nThompson ended up generating much of his own local sigint. \nFortunately his intelligence staff had picked up a local radio link \ntransmitting messages from enemy troops on the Falklands to \ntheir families in Argentina. Not only were these messages in \nclear, they also carried the name, rank, unit and location of the \nsender. This amazing security lapse by the Argentineans gave \nThompson much of the information he needed on the enemy \npositions. Good intelligence came from local interception by \ntactical sigint from the Royal Marines' own Y Troop sigint unit, \nor from patrolling by the SAS and SBS. Nevertheless, the failure \nto push national sigint from GCHQ to the front line seems to \nhave led to problems. Notably, 450 British paratroopers led by \nColonel H. Jones captured Goose Green, at considerable cost, \ndefeating a force four times their size. The Defence Intelligence \nStaff in London seem to have received a full picture of the \nenemy forces at Goose Green, but it does not appear that local \nBritish commanders were ever fully aware of the size or nature \nof the force they were confronting.79 \nBrigadier Thompson himself recalls how poorly he was served \nby national intelligence, and the rather fragmented information \nthat was available to him once his troops were on the ground: \n* We had very little intelligence, and what we had was often \nwrong. For example, the Argentinean commander \nMenendez was labelled a hard-hitting tough guy, but actu\u00ad\nally was a conciliatory sort of chap, probably selected to \nbe governor, who in my view was not a good choice to \n412 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nfight a battle. The intelligence picture did improve, mainly \nfrom radio intelligence monitoring. Although we built up \nan accurate picture of which units were where on the \nislands, we didn't know what equipment they had.so \n* Rather as the British Army of the Rhine had planned in Germany \nin the 1960s and 1970s, the intelligence gap was filled not from \nnational assets, but by the local commander's own Y Troop and \nby special forces, who were often moving within yards of the \nArgentine positions. \nUseful intelligence also carne from the islanders. The most \nremarkable was perhaps Reg Silvey, the keeper of the light\u00ad\nhouse at Cape Pembroke. When Argentine patrols required him \nto hand over his radio transmitter, he only handed over his \nsecond set. Having dismantled his radio mast, he then used the \nsteel core of his washing line and his remaining transmitter to \nsend information on Argentine troop movements to the British. \nHe also listened in on transmissions by the Argentine forces, \nwhich they mistakenly considered immune to interception \nbecause they were low-power and short-range. Moreover, he \ncreated confusion by recording Argentine radio traffic and then \nrebroadcasting it later on the same frequency. Perhaps the most \nvaluable information he provided was the fact that there were \nno islanders on the Stanley Airport peninsula, clearing the way \nfor sustained shelling and several marathon bombing raids by \nRAF Vulcans, code-named 'Black Buck'.81 General Mario \nMenendez, the Argentine military governor, confirms that some \nislanders were caught communicating with the British fleet, and \nalthough the Argentinean forces would have been within their \nrights to shoot them, their treatment was restrained.82 Carlos \nBloomer-Reeve, the Argentine Secretary General, also recalls \nthat the senior officers were 'trying to arrest a lot of people' in \ntheir search for 'an illegal radio station'.83 \nThe Argentineans were clearly doing their own tactical sigint. \nGeneral Menendez claims: 'We intercepted all communications \nby radio from the British troops,' but what this actually amounted \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 413 \nto, and how it was used, is not clear.84 In the latter stages of \nthe campaign Brigadier Thompson was treated to a brief but \ndramatic insight into the hazards of enemy radio direction\u00ad\nfinding. The headquarters of his 3 Commando Brigade had \nbeen set up on the reverse slopes of Mount Kent as the Royal \nMarines prepared to attack Mount Tumbledown, and he recalls \nthat the Argentineans located them using radio direction\u00ad\nfinding. Nearby helicopters also helped to give away their \nposition. His headquarters were soon attacked by two A4 \nSkyhawks which dropped seven thousand-pound bombs in two \npasses, and then attacked with cannon fire. It was a miracle \nno one was killed. The tent in which Thompson was about to \ngive attack orders to his commanders was pepper-potted with \nshrapnel, and the chairs they were about to sit on had their \naluminium legs sliced off.85 \nOn 15 June, British troops marched into Port Stanley and the \nArgentinean forces surrendered. A month later the last prisoner \nwas exchanged and released. On 12 October there was a victory \nparade through London. Three days later, Lieutenant General \nSir James Glover, Britain's most senior Army intelligence officer, \nvisited Washington and gave a detailed briefing on intelligence \nand the Falklands War to his opposite number General William \nOdom, head of US Army intelligence. In the Falklands campaign, \nGlover said, sigint had provided 90 per cent of intelligence. \nComint had performed exceedingly well, and had proved 'invalu\u00ad\nable'. Elint had proved more of a 'mixed blessing'. The most \nimportant lesson -soon forgotten, of course -was that local \narmy sigint units often found they were collecting strategic sigint \nthat related to high policy, while strategic sigint collectors using \nnational resources found they were often collecting tactical sigint \nof more use to those in the front line. The systems were not \nwell designed to move this material in a sophisticated way to \nthe right customers. There had been time delays when targets \nchanged, and problems with getting sigint to the fighting units \nas the pattern of battles changed hour by hour.86 Nevertheless, \nsigint had been hugely important, and at the end of the campaign \n414 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nBrian Tovey, the Director of GCHQ, sent a message to all the \nstaff at Cheltenham which read: 'High level praise. Never has \nso much praise been accorded. There can be no doubt that this \npraise has been well deserved. It has been earned by hard and \ndedicated work by you as individuals:87 \nSigint shone partly because of the weakness of other sources. \nImagery was often unavailable due to cloud cover. The Army \nhad no drones, and aircraft were only covering sporadic tactical \ntargets. SIS was 'slow to develop' in the region, but its work \nwith the Defence Intelligence Staff against Exocet shipments \nhad been invaluable. PoW interrogations and the islanders them\u00ad\nselves had been helpful. Intelligence weaknesses for forward \noperations required much use of special forces, which had made \na 'critical contribution'. The need for intelligence prior to the \nlandings had really stretched the special forces. The other missing \nelement, again a perennial problem in British military opera\u00ad\ntions, was good, reliable, secure communications. The British \nhad become aware from their own sigint of their vulnerability \nto Argentinean sigim. What the Army now wanted was a jump \nforward to 'burst communications' that would defeat enemy \nlistening. Deception was fairly successful, but tended to consist \nof small-scale activities and lacked an overall strategic theme.88 \nThe poor performance of the Nimrods, on which Britain had \nblown such a large slice of its sigint budget, is still a mystery. \nLt Colonel David Chaundler, who served in the Defence \nIntelligence Staff until halfway through the campaign, asserted, \n'The Nimrods were achieving very little: despite the enormous \neffort that was being put into refuelling them.89 At least eight \nmaritime reconnaissance Nimrods operated from Ascension \nIsland, and one Rl sigint aircraft seems to have flown from the \nChilean base at Punta Arenas.9o \nIn a crisis you find out who your friends are. In 1982 the \nAmericans were very helpful, but Britain's European allies rallied \nto her cause even quicker.91 The Defence Secretary, John Nott, \nremarked: 'In so many ways [President] Mitterrand and the \nA SURPRISE ATTACK -THE FALKLANDS WAR 415 \nFrench were our greatest allies.' This included considerable assis\u00ad\ntance with signals intelligence. Recent revelations suggest that \nsigint from French Guyana, and also from the Dutch site at \nEemnes, was important in assisting the British effort.92 Margaret \nThatcher also pronounced Mitterrand to be an 'absolutely \nstaunch' ally.93 Not only did the French refuse to hand over the \nExocets that the Argentineans had already paid for, they offered \nthe British details of the electronic signatures of the missiles. \nThe Spanish also proved to be firm friends, shutting down a \ncovert operation by an Argentine underwater demolition team \nto attack British ships at Gibraltar. Surprisingly, Israel supplied \nweapons and training to the neo-fascist Argentinean regime \nduring the conflict. This continued after the war, when the \nIsraelis refitted three Argentinean Air Force 707s of the 'Burglar' \nvariety with new sigint equipment so they became the equiv\u00ad\nalent of Britain's Nimrod Rl listening aircraft.94 \nThe Falklands War was profoundly important for the devel\u00ad\nopment of British sigint, and triggered GCHQ's ill-fated exper\u00ad\niment with an independent sigint satellite system in the \nmid -1980s. During the Falklands War, American defence and \nintelligence agencies had certainly been very helpful. NSA had \nallowed the retargeting of one of its powerful sigint satellites \nfor a few hours each day, and handed the 'take' over to GCHQ. \nAfter some argument, imagery satellites had also been diverted \nat considerable financial cost, since their operational lives were \nshortened. However, this episode also illuminated a dangerous \ndependency on American satellite technology for future mili\u00ad\ntary operations. By 1983 Cheltenham had begun to ask, what \nwould happen if one day the Americans decided not to be quite \nso accommodating? Flushed with success from a good sigint \nperformance in the Falklands campaign, GCHQ's Director, Brian \nTovey, now stepped forward with a proposal. The result was \nplans for GCHQ's own sigint satellite, code-named 'Zircon' -by \nfar the most secret British defence project of the 1980s.95 \n21 \nThatcher and the GCHQ \nTrade Union Ban \n... it was carefully prepared in secret and it came as a bolt from \nthe blue -bang! \nMike Grindley, Chinese linguist, GCHQi \nThe acrimonious GCHQ trade union dispute that occurred in \nearly 1984 has to be seen in the context of a wider struggle. \nFor more than a decade both Labour and Conservative govern\u00ad\nments had been challenged by union power, especially in the \narea of economic policy. Margaret Thatcher was determined to \nend this, and during its first term in office her government \npassed a range of trade union legislation, restricting activities \nsuch as strikes and picketing. Although the unions had vowed \nto resist this, the moderate leader of the TUC, Len Murray, told \nhis colleagues that if the Conservatives were elected for a second \nterm in 1983, they would have to accept it. The Conservatives \nwere re-elected, but confrontation continued. By the autumn \nof 1983 there was a high-profile printing dispute at Warrington \nand an ongoing miners' strike led by Arthur Scargill. It was \nagainst this volatile background that the Thatcher government \ndecided to ban unions at GCHQ, in a surprise decision announced \nin January 1984. \nThe ban caused a furore throughout the union movement, \nand even the most moderate trade unionists were appalled. The \npersonal position of Len Murray was undermined. He worked \nwith the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, to put together \na compromise in the spring of 1984 which he hoped would be \nacceptable to the Cabinet, but it was rejected on the personal \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 417 \nwhim of the Prime Minister. Jim Prior, the Northern Ireland \nSecretary, recalls that at that moment, 'Len Murray was lost.' \nIt is hard to escape the conclusion that both Margaret Thatcher \nand the major unions used GCHQ as a pawn in a wider ideo\u00ad\nlogical battle. Neither the managers nor the trade unionists at \nGCHQ were directly responsible for what followed.2 \nThe issue of trade unions at Cheltenham is synonymous with \nthe Thatcher era. After its eruption in early 1984, it constituted \na running sore until it was resolved in 1997. Yet it is rarely \nrealised that union issues were not new to the secret world, or \nindeed to GCHQ. Paradoxically, GCHQ had always had trade \nunions because it was even more secret than its sister services, \nMIS and SIS, which did not. This was because many GCHQ \nworkers were hidden inside other units -such as the Diplomatic \nWireless Staff (DWS) -that might reasonably expect union repre\u00ad\nsentation. Moreover, unlike MIS or SIS, Cheltenham was effec\u00ad\ntively a vast factory that produced intelligence on an industrial \nscale. The majority of employees at GCHQ and its outstations \nwere working a shift system. In all factories, even secret ones, \nthere is a clear hierarchy, and good labour relations are of the \nfirst importance. Yet the managers at GCHQ could be remote \nfigures who were rather conscious of their grades. As a result, \nunion issues had raged beneath the surface of British sigint since \nthe 1950s. \nDisruption of GCHQ's activities through union action was not \nthe only source of anxiety. Officials believed there were also \nsecurity issues. Although they conceded that no union official \nhad ever been detected acting as a spy, nevertheless they worried \nthat a significant proportion of officials in some key unions were \nCommunists. Spy cases during the 1950s and 1960s had shown \nbeyond any doubt that Communist Party membership often \nmeant espionage, and Foreign Office officials feared 'a direct, \nunfettered and undetectable line of liaison between staff having \nknowledge of secret affairs and Communists'. Some senior offi\u00ad\ncials had pondered the alternative of a staff association, in other \nwords a tame internal union not affiliated to the TUC, for staff \n418 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nin specialist establishments like GCHQ and Hanslope Park.3 \nManagers at both the DWS and GCHQ had liked the idea, but \nMinisters baulked at the political difficulties -it would mean \nwithdrawing normal union membership from many existing \nstaff, and conflict was anticipated. Without concrete evidence \nof union-related espionage it was decided to continue with the \npresent situation.4 In fact, the main problem was labour rela\u00ad\ntions, not espionage. GCHQ had faced constant issues with Radio \nOperators because of changing communications technology. New \nequipment and work of increased complexity meant new grades \nand many different levels of pay. \nOn 11 November 1955, John Winnifrith, a Treasury official \nwho looked after security matters, had reported, 'Trouble is \nbrewing in GCHQ.' This was because of a complex dispute \ninvolving competing unions which wished to represent the Slip\u00ad\nReaders who worked alongside the Radio Operators, turning \nthe electronic signals captured as sound into processible \nmessages. The Civil Service Union was battling it out with the \nsmaller Government and Overseas Cable and Wireless Operators \nAssociation, but Winnifrith explained to his superiors that \n'the politics go far further than that'. He had been told 'in \nconfidence' that what was really behind this dispute was the \nfact that 'management at GCHQ had deliberately brought this \nsmaller association in to spike the guns of CSU', as they did not \nwant the Slip-Readers to join an already over-mighty union.5 \nThis deliberate policy of 'divide and rule' on the part of Eric \nJones, GCHQ's Director in the early 1950s, was probably a \nmistake. \nIn April 1962 the Radcliffe Inquiry into Security in the Civil \nService had resurrected security fears about trade unions. MI5 \nnow estimated that one third of full-time officials in the major \nCivil Service unions were either Communists or Communist \nsympathisers. The Electrical Trades Union had Communist full\u00ad\ntime officials. At a number of secret establishments, primarily \nthe Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, MIS was \nlooking closely at specific trade union officials. However, this \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 419 \nwas slippery territory, since MI5 did not want GCHQ or \nAldermaston to take precautionary action that would jeopar\u00ad\ndise its sources. Their greatest worry was that trade unionists, \nwhose legitimate role was to hear staff grievances, would be \nable to 'talent spot' for the KGB, identifying disgruntled indi\u00ad\nviduals who might be willing to act as 'hostile intelligence \nagents'. Once again, management pressed for staff associations \nthat had no links to mainstream unions. However, when Privy \nCouncillors consulted the TUC they were warned that such a \nmove would 'meet with the strongest possible Trade Union \nopposition'. Fearillg political confrontation, the government \nbacked away.6 \nMichael Herman, who was head of the prestigious J Division, \ndealing with Russian problems, observes that by and large there \nwas not much union militancy at GCHQ. However, the Radio \nOperators had some genuinely awkward problems, including \n'age bulges' resulting from the recruitment of a lot of wartime \nstaff which blighted promotion prospects. Working conditions \nin some of the outstations like Cyprus and Hong Kong were \nalso poor.7 In early September 1969, all this boiled over in a \nfive-day strike. This was notionally a work-to-rule after the \nrejection of a recent pay claim. Some 2,200 Radio Operators \nwere affected, and product from Cyprus and Hong Kong slowed \nto a trickle. Much of the operators' work involved searching for \nradio traffic. During the dispute they found very little, but once \nit was over, production mysteriously bounced back to normal. \nJoe Hooper, the Director, intervened personally to persuade the \nTreasury to reconsider the rejected pay claim. John Somerville, \nhis Principal Establishment Officer, later admitted that indus\u00ad\ntrial action now became a 'sword of Damocles', because the \n1969 work-to-rule had 'an immediate and drastic effect on the \nwork of GCHQ'.8 In the long term, the agency responded by \nmoving away from manual collection by people who sat in huts \nwith headphones on, towards more of the sort of automated \nsystems already used by the Americans.9 \nIn February 1973 the Civil and Public Servants Association \n420 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nhad called a one-day strike as part of a general dispute over \ngovernment public-sector pay policy. Principal Establishment \nOfficers from across the Foreign Office met to review the likely \ndamage to operations . .Tohn Somerville explained that at GCHQ \nthe situation was complex, since there were 7,500 staff distrib\u00ad\nuted amongst forty different classes or grades. Half belonged to \nthe Civil and Public Servants Association, and the majority \nfavoured action. The Civil Service Union had also lodged a new \npay claim that was likely to lead to trouble. Somerville's main \nworry was the impact this might have on sensitive activities: \n'The principal area involved would be the computer centre \nwhich might have to be shut down.' This was because the \ncomputers that undertook the core cryptanalysis ran around the. \nclock, and depended on shift work. All this, he added, would \nhave 'unfortunate effects on certain aspects of bi-Iateral coop\u00ad\neration' by which he meant GCHQ's collaboration with NSA. IO \nThe next serious dispute with the Radio Operators did not \narrive until 1979. The strikes of that year, which rumbled on \nuntil 1981, were partly caused by an acceleration of the Cold \nWar, driven by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. Normally, \nfresh monitoring equipment for the Radio Operators at loca\u00ad\ntions such as Cyprus and Hong Kong underwent a long period \nof development and operational testing. However, from 1979 a \nseries of crises drove the emergency deployment of new sigint \nequipment, with little discussion about procedure. This time it \nwas the local managers, or Station Radio Officers, who were \nupset. The Station Radio Officer was the local manager of \nresources, and his key role was tactical targeting. If an inter\u00ad\nnational event occurred that was of interest, he had responsi\u00ad\nbility to shift the station's effort from routine targets to new \ntargets of opportunity. Such redirection was required frequently \nduring the mUltiple international crises that occurred between \nlate 1979 and early 1980. \nPeter Little, who had been head of K Division, the part of \nGCHQ dealing with non-Soviet traffic, in the early 1980s, later \nidentified the four international events which coincided with \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 421 \nthis long-running dispute: the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, \nthe hostage crisis in Iran, the invasion of Poland by Russia in \n1980-81, and the main annual Soviet military exercise in \nSeptember 1981. K Division was heavily involved in these \nissuesY GCHQ's allies had helped out by covering for the lost \ninterception as a result of the dispute, but the disruption was \nembarrassing. Typically, additional coverage during the Polish \ncrisis had been provided by Sweden's sigint service, the FRA. 12 \nThere were other reasons for poor GCHQ performance during \nthe Polish crisis, including the breakdown of equipment. \nHowever, unhappiness with coverage of this event fed into the \nongoing Douglas Nicoll review.13 Michael Herman recalls his \n'feeling of sadness and shame ... when a Cold War 24-hour \nsurveillance unit for which I was responsible closed down for \na night watch as part of a departmental pay dispute'. Again, \nthe allies, including NSA, had to 'take the strain'.14 \nThe Anglo-American relationship loomed large here, since \nthe strikes impacted directly and painfully on GCHQ's growing \nrole as a processor of the 'take' from NSA's new satellites. As \nwe have seen, in the 1970s NSA was picking up vastly more \nproduct because of its new Ryolite satellites, but had less human \nprocessing power because of budget cuts. GCHQ, the Canadian \nand Australian sigint services had helped out by offering to \nanalyse some of the material. Much of GCHQ was now a \nprocessing unit for the streams of sigint that NSA was beaming \ndown to Menwith Hill in Yorkshire, and it feared anything that \nwould disrupt this. In other words, GCHQ and NSA were now \nwired together in a way that they had not quite been before. \nMeanwhile, with union relations in Britain generally looking \ndifficult, GCHQ anticipated more strikes across the whole Civil \nService than in the past. Accordingly, Cheltenham's managers \nnow returned to the idea of a staff association to replace unions \nthat had been floated in the 1950s and 1960s. \nBrian Tovey, a bullish figure who had taken over as Director \nof GCHQ in 1979, recalls that the strikes of that year were 'the \nturning point' for him. He was always puzzled by the presence \n422 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nof the unions at GCHQ, unlike NSA, which he characterised as \na 'cast-iron organisation' with a military complexion. GCHQ's \nindustrial action was now impacting on the two agencies' shared \nprojects. Tovey would have to tell NSA: 'We've had to drop this \nbecause of industrial unrest. Could you pick it up for us?' The \nAmericans found this bizarre. Something else had begun to \nbother Tovey. Traditionally, union strike action had tended to \nfocus on departments that delivered mainstream public services, \nsuch as the National Insurance Office or the Department of \nHealth and Social Security, since this disruption attracted \npublicity. However, during the late 1970s the union leaders in \nLondon had 'twigged' that disruption at GCHQ bothered the \ngovernment.I5 \nBy 1981, general industrial strife was accelerating, and in \nTovey's words the unions had made it 'brutally clear' that they \nregarded GCHQ as a 'damn good place to hit'. As a result, he \nnoticed 'a reluctance to enter into work-sharing' on the part of \nthe Americans. When GCHQ offered further joint projects, NSA \ntended to think: 'Oh Lord, we don't know if we can rely on \nthe British.' Accordingly, in early 1981, when Tovey quietly \ninformed his NSA opposite number, Bobby Ray Inman, of his \nplans to get the unions banned, Inman replied, 'That's marvel\u00ad\nlous.'i6 Indeed, the perception of a threat to the Anglo-American \nintelligence relationship was now widely shared across govern\u00ad\nment. Jim Prior, who was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland \nat the time, recalled that union action at GCHQ in 1981 'had \nvery much upset the Americans' Y \nThe next strike, on 9 March 1981, was part of a general day \nof action by the Civil Service Union. About a quarter of GCHQ \nstaff walked out. Even at the time, local CSU officials at \nCheltenham worried that this was a bad idea. Mike Vernon, a \nmember of the CSU's committee that looked after Radio \nOperators, was conscious of GCHQ's declining position as a \nproducer in the wider world of sigint agencies. GCHQ was \nlooking old and tired alongside younger agencies such as the \nWest German BND. Everyone knew that NSA was thinking \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 423 \nabout a closer relationship with the BND, and was investing \nheavily in its station at Bad Aibling in Germany. America had \nalso repaired its relationship with TUrkey, reducing the value of \nCyprus. Vernon thought that jobs at some of GCHQ's outsta\u00ad\ntions were in jeopardy. IS Mike Bradshaw, another union offi\u00ad\ncial, admits that the CSU's tactics between 1979 and 1981 \nincluded trying to embarrass GCHQ in front of its American \npartners. If the intention was to provoke a reaction, it worked.19 \nExactly why Margaret Thatcher chose to confront the unions \nover GCHQ in January 1984, rather than in 1981, remains a \nmystery. Brian Tovey had discussed the union matter at length \nwith his board of directors in 1980, and had drawn up a secret \nplan for de-unionisation, code-named 'Status',2\u00b0 He formally \nasked the government for a union ban following the CSU's 9 \nMarch 1981 day of action, but as in the 1950s and 1960s, \ngovernment Ministers recoiled in horror. The main opponent \nwas the Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington, who objected on \nprinciple, viewing trade union membership as a basic human \nright. Even within the Permanent Secretaries' Committee on \nthe Intelligence Services (PSIS), Sir Douglas Vass at the Treasury \nand Frank Cooper at the Ministry of Defence argued that it \nwould cause too much trouble.21 Francis Pym, Carrington's \nsuccessor as Foreign Secretary in 1982, would also have nothing \nto do with the idea of a union ban at GCHQ.22 \nMargaret Thatcher later misrepresented this. Hiding minister\u00ad\nial dissent, she insisted that the reason no action was taken in \n1981 was because it would have drawn undue attention to \nGCHQ's intelligence-gathering activities, which were not yet \npublicly avowed. By contrast, she claimed after the Geoffrey Prime \naffair of 1982 that the truth about GCHQ's duties was in the \nopenY This is simply not a plausible explanation. The real nature \nof GCHQ had been revealed to the Russians by countless defec\u00ad\ntors, including the NSA operatives Martin and Mitchell in 1960, \nand to the British public by Duncan Campbell and the infamous \nABC trial in 1978.24 So what suddenly changed Margaret \nThatcher'S mind in 1984? Part of the reason was politics. Lord \n424 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nCarrington, one of the staunchest objectors to a union ban, had \nresigned over the Falklands. Now in her second administration, \nwith a large post-Falklands majority, she was more confident. \nHowever, another issue lurked underneath: the much-feared \npolygraph. As we have seen, in July 1983, having reviewed the \nPrime case and visited NSA, the Security Commission had recom\u00ad\nmended the introduction of the polygraph at GCHQ. The unions \nfeared that the polygraph was inaccurate, and that many inno\u00ad\ncent individuals would fail the test. Staunch union resistance was \nguaranteed, so the removal of the unions seemed to be a pre\u00ad\nrequisite for the introduction of this unpopular security measure.25 \nThe dark shadow of the polygraph also explains why govern\u00ad\nment did not pursue obvious options such as a 'continuity of \nservice' agreement -effectively a non-strike agreement -with \nthe unions. Brian Tovey told the Employment Select Committee \nof the House of Commons that this would have left him perfectly \nsatisfied. However, it would not have solved the underlying \nproblem of union resistance to the polygraph. This left managers \nwith no choice but to go down the more radical road of replacing \nthe unions with a staff federation. The polygraph also shut off \nthe other sensible option of closing union membership to new \njoiners. Given that union membership at Cheltenham was only \nabout half the staff, this would have reduced it significantly \nover a decade, with the unions gradually withering on the vine. \nHowever, the polygraph issue required them to be removed \nabruptly.26 \nNSA did not give GCHQ any sort of directive on the issue. \nBrian Tovey has stated that the Americans never explicitly \nrequested the removal of trade unions at GCHQ, and that it \nwas his own initiative. However, they had directly and repeat\u00ad\nedly requested the introduction of the polygraph, and former \nDeputy Director of NSA Benson Buffham had come to London \nto reinforce this. The team NSA sent to Britain to assess the \ndamage caused by Geoffrey Prime concluded that while the \nsystems for handling sigint product securely were standardised \nthroughout the UKUSA alliance system, the protocols for \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 425 \npersonnel security were lamentably weak. The sense of urgency \nwas increased by the fact that some believed that Prime had \nassisted the KGB with the recruitment of further moles. The \npressure for the polygraph influenced the way in which the \ntrade union ban was implemented.27 \nThe unions were clearly petrified by the polygraph. In May \n1983 the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Robert Armstrong, assured them \nthat 'no loyal servant has anything to fear' from the polygraph, \nand promised further talks before it was introduced. However, \nthe unions believed it would be introduced quickly, and perhaps \noperated by Amtricans.28 In July 1983 Armstrong explained \nthat there was 'a risk that the USA would question UKUSA \nexchange if the UK did not at least, run a pilot scheme to see \nif the polygraph was feasible'. He assured the unions that the \nmachines would not be operated by Americans, but by MIS \npersonnel who were even now undertaking a fourteen-week \ntraining course in the USA.29 The unions now saw the intro\u00ad\nduction of the polygraph as a foregone conclusion. At \nCheltenham, both security (R Division) and personnel (E \nDivision) were thought to be keen, since it was known that \nRussian agents were briefed to avoid exposure to the polygraph \nif at all possible.3D By November 1983 the unions suspected that \nE3, part of the personnel division, already had machines hidden \non the premises at GCHQ, although there were fervent denials.3l \nThe following month, senior staff at GCHQ volunteered to act \nas guinea pigs, and a pilot machine was allocated to Personnel \nSecurity Branch (RI2).32 Margaret Thatcher was personally \ncommitted to the polygraph, arguing that 'people employed in \nwork which makes them privy to that nation's highest secrets \nwould ... accept the logic' and realise that it was aimed at \nstrengthening their organisation against 'hostile penetration'. 33 \nThe trade unions had good reason to resist the polygraph. \nThe Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Procedure had \nrecently examined the device, and concluded that while the \nclaimed 86 per cent success rate sounded good, what it meant \nin practice was that there existed a high chance of honest people \n426 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nbeing branded a security risk. Moreover, any agents who slipped \npast the polygraph -which required only a modicum of training \n-would have their reliability falsely confirmed.34 No fewer than \nfour NSA staff who defected to the Russians had taken and \npassed the polygraph test.35 Researchers at the University of \nPennsylvania medical school had found that an effective way \nof fooling the machine was to take 400mg of a widely avail\u00ad\nable drug called Meprobamate.36 The worry was not so much \nthe testing of new entrants to GCHQ, but that many loyal staff \nwith years of service might fail the test and have their clear\u00ad\nances removed. In October 1983 the Society of Civil and Public \nServants produced a campaign booklet with a chapter entitled \n'How to Beat the Polygraph'.37 \nIn December 1983 a secret Cabinet subcommittee was created \nto implement a GCHQ trade union ban. The members of this \ncommittee were Margaret Thatcher, the Defence Secretary \nMichael Heseltine, the Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, the \nEmployment Secretary Tom King and Deputy Prime Minister \nWillie Whitelaw. Howe recalled that this committee gave 'a good \ndeal of thought, or so we believed, to sugaring the pill', and \nfinally decided to offer GCHQ employees financial compensa\u00ad\ntion for the loss of their union rights. In gloomy tones he noted \nthat somehow 'it fell to me' to present this to the House of \nCommons in a 'surprise' statement on 25 January 1984. In fact \nthe whole thing was prepared with such obsessive secrecy that \nHowe now recalls it with 'astonishment'. Only two other major \nfigures were told in advance. TUC General Secretary Len Murray \nand Shadow Foreign Secretary Denis Healey, both Privy \nCouncillors, were called to Howe's office in the Commons to \nbe informed a few hours before the announcement. Healey, one \nof the most intelligent people ever to hold ministerial office, \nimmediately recognised the scale of the impending blunder, and \nwas 'beside himself with delight at the political hay he would \nbe able to make. 'From the moment when I made my state\u00ad\nment to the House: recalls Howe, 'a huge storm of denuncia\u00ad\ntion broke about my head.'38 \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 427 \nAt GCHQ the implementation was also handled with \npantomime secrecy. Brian Tovey, one of the foremost advocates \nof the ban, had now departed, and it fell to his successor, Peter \nMarychurch, to implement it. A general letter to all staff from \nJohn Adye, the Principal Establishment Officer, was photocopied \nin the United States and flown in. Its distribution, timed for the \nafternoon of Howe's Commons statement, was handled by E \nDivision, located in A Block at GCHQ's Oakley site. The timing \nwas complex, since there were many overseas stations, and the \nmanagers were called to Britain for a briefing.39 John Adye's \nletter explained to staff that the option of belonging to main\u00ad\nstream trade unions was being withdrawn. They now had the \noption of giving up their right to union membership -even if \nthey did not actually belong to a union -and receiving \u00a31,000 \nin compensation. This was known as 'Option N. Alternatively, \nthey could ask for redeployment elsewhere in the Civil Service, \nwhich was known as 'Option B'. Those who refused to take \neither course risked being fired. The unions would be replaced \nby a new in-house staff federation. At 3 p.m., while the letter \nwas being distributed to staff, John Adye met union leaders to \ngive them a briefing.40 \nThe union representatives were in shock. They urged members \nnot to sign away their rights, and then convened at Cheltenham's \nPittville Pump Room late in the afternoon to decide what to \ndo. The strategy the unions chose to pursue was fairly reactive. \nAlthough they had the overwhelming support of most MPs, \nincluding many Conservatives, and the press, they had been \nstunned by the surprise announcement. Most believed that the \ngovernment would accept a compromise. On 1 February Len \nMurray led a fourteen-strong TUC delegation to Downing Street, \nwhere they met Margaret Thatcher, Geoffrey Howe, Tom King, \nWillie Whitelaw and Robert Armstrong. The unions accepted \nthat the anxiety about disruption to intelligence was not absurd, \nbut took issue with the way the issue had been handled. They \noffered a 'no disruption agreement'. King, Whitelaw and Howe \nalso urged a compromise, Howe suggesting that staff could \n428 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nremain union members if they agreed not to engage in strike \nactivity.41 \nThe fly in the ointment was Bernard Ingham, Margaret \nThatcher's Press Secretary. Howe captures Ingham's role perfectly \nwhen he says that his strength lay in 'his ability to articulate \nthe Prime Minister's prejudices more crisply even than she could \nherself'. Ingham told Thatcher that the press would see a \ncompromise as a sign of weakness -in effect a 'U-turn'. Lord \nGowrie, Minister for the Civil Service, and Thatcher'S Principal \nPrivate Secretary, Sir Robin Butler, were also against compro\u00ad\nmise.42 Accordingly, on 28 February there was a second meeting, \nand the compromise was rejected. The unions then played into \nThatcher'S hands by calling a one-day strike. The TUC had given \na lot of ground, and Robert Armstrong, the Cabinet Secretary, \nhad expected the compromise to be accepted. Indeed, he had \nsignalled as much to the unions, and was now embarrassed. \nThe Foreign Office later argued that the deal offered did not \nprovide 'sufficient guarantees'. In truth, it was rejected on a \nprime ministerial whimY \nJohn Somerville, who served as GCHQ's Principal \nEstablishment Officer throughout the 1970s, observed: 'When \nthe union put their teeth on the table in February 1984, I cannot \nunderstand why the Prime Minister did not pick them Up.'44 \nBrian Tovey also told. the Employment Select Committee that \nthe no-strike deal offered by Len Murray during the talks at \nDowning Street would have been much preferable to a ban on \nunion membershipY However, the Prime Minister was now \nvery much in the driving seat. Indeed, in setting up the new \nGovernment Communications Staff Federation, which was \ndesigned to replace the unions, Peter Marychurch was very \ncareful to refer back to London to identify the precise terms \nunder which this body would be acceptable to the government.46 \nThey included making its activities subject to veto by both the \nDirector of GCHQ and the Foreign Secretary.47 \nOn 27 February 1984 an acrimonious House of Commons \ndebated the GCHQ ban. The nub of the issue was disruption, \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 429 \nand several trade unions had handed Margaret Thatcher price\u00ad\nless ammunition. Milltants had boasted about creating difficulty \nat GCHQ, and appeared to gloat at the idea of interrupting intel\u00ad\nligence work at such a sensitive security location. Thatcher \nquoted directly from two union documents, including a CSU \ncampaign report of 1981 which spoke approvingly of applying \npressure in 'sensitive areas' .48 It also claimed that the day of \naction in March 1981 had caused 'serious disruption and incon\u00ad\nvenience', and that 'international relationships with other \ngovernments had been under great strain' -an obvious refer\u00ad\nence to NSA.49 Other unions had claimed that '48-hour walk\u00ad\nouts have severely hit secret monitoring stations', and that the \ngovernment was 'clearly worried and will be subject to huge \npressure from NATO allies'. These union statements were \nuncomfortable facts that could not be denied.50 \nNevertheless, Denis Healey had a field day deriding Geoffrey \nHowe, and denounced the new Government Communications \nStaff Federation as a 'yellow-dog union'. The exact degree of \nunion disruption was disputed on all sides of the Commons. Sir \nJohn Notl, who had been Defence Secretary during the recent \nFalklands War, asserted, 'Up to now they have not in any way \naffected operational capability in any area.' Both proponents \nand opponents of the ban tended to fixate on the headline issue \nof the number of working days lost. The government claimed \nthat ten thousand were lost due to the disputes of 1979-8 L \nand stressed the fact that they occurred during a number of \ninternational crises. Opponents argued this was only a tiny frac\u00ad\ntion of the working days in a year. Neither side recognised that \nthe real issue was the impact on specific sensitive programmes \nlike J-Ops, which was far harder to measure.51 However, the \nlater claim made by William Waldegrave, a Minister of State at \nthe Foreign Office, on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that \n'GCHQ was constantly out of action' was certainly a wild exag\u00ad\ngera tion. 52 \nIf the whole workforce at GCHQ had refused to sign away \ntheir rights, or had asked to be transferred, the ban would have \n430 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nfailed. But the unions were on a losing wicket from the start. \nFirstly, GCHQ was only about half unionised. So for those who \nwere not members, the offer of a \u00a31,000 payment (equivalent \nto \u00a33,500 at current prices) for giving up something they did \nnot value was most attractive. Out of eight thousand staff, 7,700 \neventually signed 'Option N and happily collected their payment. \nOnly 150 opted for a transfer, and about the same number \nrefused to sign. Resistance to de-unionisation had melted away \nlike the morning mist. Down the road in Cheltenham town \ncentre, the effects were dramatic, since the payments immedi\u00ad\nately pumped almost \u00a35 million into the local economy.53 \nCheltenham retailers loved it, and a vast spending spree followed. \nThomas Cook reported mammoth holiday bookings. One family \nbooked a trip to Dallas, saying gleefully: 'We are going cour\u00ad\ntesy of Mrs Thatcher: The manager of Cheltenham's largest \ndepartment store reported brisk sales of washing machines, \nvideos and televisions, and some retailers arranged 'emergency \ndeliveries' of luxury goods.54 \nThe more stalwart union members realised that they required \na long-term strategy. The most important decision they took \nwas to establish a GCHQ Free Trade Union led by Mike Grindley, \na Chinese linguist. Created on 1 March 1984, it consisted of \nmembers of the six existing trade unions at Cheltenham and \nrepresentatives from the UK outstations. It met in the GCHQ \ncanteen on a Monday evening, and launched a regular campaign \npublication entitled Warning Signal. It adopted a three-pronged \napproach: firstly, mobilising strong support within the wider \nunion movement; secondly, seeking a judicial review of govern\u00ad\nment policy; and thirdly, securing firm promises from the oppos\u00ad\nition that full union rights would be restored under a future \nLabour government. \nDuring May 1984 attention switched to the courts. The unions \nhad successfully obtained permission for a judicial review. The \njudge, Mr Justice Glidwell, focused on the cavalier nature of \nMargaret Thatcher's initial decision to ban the unions, a simple \nverbal instruction to Sir Robert Armstrong on 22 December 1983, \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 431 \nissued without discussion or process. Glidwell dedded that the \noral instruction had no standing, and moreover, that the GCHQ \nworkers were entitled to consultation before such a dramatic \nchange in their work practices took place. By contrast, the govern\u00ad\nment case rested heavily on reference to the 1982 Civil Service \nOrder in Coundl, an instrument which harked back to Royal \nPrerogative. This, the government argued, gave it the power to \ndo pretty much whatever it liked without consulting Parliament. \nGlidwell was unimpressed, observing dryly that this was 'an \nunusual way to legislate'. On 16 July he overturned the ban, \nreading out a judgement of no fewer than sixty-four pages which, \nas he put it, 'raised matters of considerable constitutional impor\u00ad\ntance'.55 The government had antidpated Glidwell's judgement, \nsince the previous day Geoffrey Howe had flown to GCHQ by \nhelicopter for an emergency conference with Peter Marychurch.56 \nIn the wake of this, John Adye, the Prindpal Establishment \nOfficer, warned staff that, pending a hearing on appeal, the posi\u00ad\ntion of GCHQ management would not change.57 Nevertheless, \na hundred GCHQ employees now merrily skipped back and \nrejoined their unions, despite having spent their \u00a31,000 \n'Thatcher payment' in the department stores of Cheltenham. \nTheir euphoria did not last long. Glidwell's judgement was over\u00ad\nturned in the Court of Appeal, where the government case \nfocused determinedly on national security. The case then went \nto the House of Lords, where the five Law Lords, including Lord \nScarman, all accepted that national security was paramount, \nsomething of a tradition amongst senior British judges. The Law \nLords complained about the government's use of outdated \nstatutes, and muttered about 'the clanking of the medieval \nchains of the ghosts of the past'.58 Nevertheless, they found in \nfavour of the government in one of the most important legal \njudgements of the late twentieth century. 59 \nGCHQ now proceeded at leisure. It waited until 1986 before \ntaking any action against the remaining union members, moving \nfirst against the 'rejoiners' who had scampered back to their \nunions. One of the problems for offidals was Geoffrey Howe's \n432 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nrash undertaking that there would be only one round of disci\u00ad\nplinary proceedings, d promise that was soon broken. As the \nvarious employees fell into a range of categories, this was always \nlikely to be a messy and prolonged business.6o For GCHQ, the \nsmall numbers of those who had refused to leave their union \nor had rejoined it was not the issue. The main problem was the \nimpact on relations with the sizeable minority of employees \nwho had signed away their rights only reluctantly, typically \nbecause of family commitments. GCHQ managers had expected \ntrouble from the Radio Operators, but not from the more cere\u00ad\nbral employees. In fact many of the mathematicians and \ncomputer experts reasoned that it was illogical for the West to \nbe trumpeting the rights of free trade unions like Solidarity in \nPoland, yet to be clamping down on unions at home. Some \nmathematicians and cryptographers who worked in H Division \nchose to leave. This unit was GCHQ's most valued human \nresource, and the damage was serious.61 \nAlexander Hamilton, a leading cryptanalyst, decided to take \nearly retirement. Hamilton was so eminent that his name had \nbeen given to several systems for decryption. George Toumlin, \nalso in H Division, held out and expected to be sacked, but \nreached retirement age before this occurred.62 H Division's anger \nat the management coalesced with other factors including poor \npay and limited equipment budgets. George Brauntoltz, who \nworked at a senior level in H Division and had been with GCHQ \nfor thirty years, was particularly outspoken. He argued that \nwhile the strikes had caused embarrassment, they had done \nlittle serious damage, which had in fact been inflicted by govern\u00ad\nment pay policies which discriminated against scientists and \nengineers, making it hard to get the cutting-edge staff that code\u00ad\nbreaking needed. There had also been continual cuts in capital \nexpenditure at GCHQ, making it difficult to 'get the tools to do \nthe job'.63 \nThe point of exodus was frequently the Golden Valley Hotel \non the edge of Cheltenham, which had long been used by ATV \nfor the external shots for the daytime soap opera Crossroads. \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 433 \nInside, large electronics companies including GEC-Marconi, \nRacal and Plessey -some of GCHQ's main suppliers -were busy \noffering GCHQ staff employment at 30 per cent above their \nexisting salaries. Having taken a pleasing \u00a31,000 from the \ngovernment, many then chose to move on to well-paid employ\u00ad\nment in the private sector. GCHQ lost half of its Higher Executive \nOfficer computer experts between 1984 and 1985. In 1983 it \nhad lost none.64 'The sharks are now round GCHQ: claimed \nDenis Healey, adding with some amusement that Brian Tovey, \nthe architect of the ban, was now also a consultant for Plessey.65 \nThe GCHQ trade unions had high hopes of the European \nCourt. However, on 20 January 1987 the European Commission \nof Human Rights ruled their case inadmissible on the grounds \nthat GCHQ resembled the armed forces, since its duties were \nintimately connected to national security. This was hardly \nsurprising, given that the European Convention gives explicit \nexemptions on national security grounds. The government's \naction was described as 'drastic' but 'in no way arbitrary'. With \nall legal remedies now exhausted, the focus of the GCHQ trade \nunions' campaign was now the repeated promises from the \nLabour Party to restore union rights in full.66 In 1983 the Labour \nleader, Michael Foot, had pledged himself to 'restore in full all \nrights of the trade unionists at GCHQ'. In 1984 and again in \n1987 his successor Neil Kinnock gave the same undertaking. \nThe Labour Manifesto for the July 1987 general election included \nthe promise, but Margaret Thatcher was returned to power for \na third time, albeit with a reduced majorityY The last trade \nunionist at GCHQ, Gareth Morris, was sacked on 2 March 1989.68 \nIronically, the government's drive to bring in the polygraph, \narguably the main reason for the abrupt nature of the ban in \nJanuary 1984, failed. In 1985 the House of Commons Select \nCommittee on Employment took a close look at the polygraph \nwith experts from the British Psychological Society. They were \nscathing, and dismissed the machine as useless. Whitehall now \nchose to run a field test on members of MIS, hoping to prove \n434 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nits effectiveness. Although the tests were secret, the results were \nleaked to the Sunday Times by mutinous officials. TVvo hundred \nmembers of MIS were tested. No less than 37 per cent failed, \nand in theory would now have to be removed from their posts \nas security risks.69 The government did not want to admit to \nthe Americans that things were not going well. On 3 March \n1986, Bill adorn, Director of NSA, made a note to himself to \n'Ask Peter Marychurch about poly of his people: but he does \nnot seem to have had a clear answer from his British counter\u00ad\npareo By the end of the year, NSA realised that GCHQ was \ndragging its feet, and was reported to be 'angered and \ndismayed'.7l \nIt was not until 8 December 1988 that Margaret Thatcher \nquietly announced that, after considering a new report by the \nMedical Research Council, and a further report by the Security \nCommission, the so-called 'second phase of trials would not \nnow go ahead'.72 This was a quiet admission of defeat. Everyone \nknew that the polygraph was unscientific and inaccurate. Its \nmain value was that it deterred those with a guilty conscience. \nNSA had observecl that the greatest benefits it provided were \nthe things people confessed to before or immediately after taking \na polygraph test because of the state of anxiety it created. \nInfamously, President Nixon once discussed the polygraph with \nhis inner circle and offered remarks in much the same vain: 'I \ndon't know anything about polygraphs, and I don't know how \naccurate they are, but I know they scare the hell out of people:73 \nWas the government correct to seek to remove union rights at \nCheltenham? On balance, the answer is probably yes. It is not \nwidely understood that union issues had been a persistent \nproblem over several decades, and the presence of the unions \nat GCHQ was anomalous compared to MIS and SIS. In the late \n1970s, as the highly secret J-Ops section of GCHQ became a \nprocessing component for NSA's massive satellite 'hoovering' \noperations, the possibility of disruption in sensitive areas, such \nas round-the-clock computer processing, caused a collective \nTHATCHER AND THE GCHQ TRADE UNION BAN 435 \nneuralgic twinge on the part of intelligence chiefs. By that time \nGCHQ was not only being affected by local grading disputes, \nbut also by national disputes in which the agency was seen as \na useful 'sore spot' to annoy government. Something had to be \ndone. \nHowever, Thatcher's approach was incompetent. It put GCHQ \nin the spotlight, a place it was not supposed to be, and also \ndamaged morale. Summarily removing trade union rights from \nthose who already had them raised profound issues of prin\u00ad\nciple. Michael Herman, the former head of J Division, offers a \ncharacteristically acute observation, noting that the sight of \nsenior civil servants 'marching in Cheltenham with the National \nUnion of Mineworkers in the annual rally of protest sums up \nthe effects'.74 There were several better options available. The \nFirst Division Association wisely recommended a continuity of \nservice agreement. Alternatively, if government had been deter\u00ad\nmined to move to a staff association, it could have taken a deci\u00ad\nsion simply to allow no new union members. This, together \nwith an offer of \u00a31,000 to voluntarily relinquish rights to union \nmembership, would have driven numbers down quickly. \nHounding the few remaining unionists was unwise and vindic\u00ad\ntive. \nFor GCHQ, the worst effect was upon staff commitment. \nThe nature of its work made it peculiarly dependent on corpor\u00ad\nate spirit and collegiality. Nancy Duff ton, a GCHQ worker, told \nthe House of Commons, 'Morale is very low since the union \nban ... The important thing, as far as the work is concerned, \nis that the sort of dedication that people used to have to the \njob is beginning to dwindle.'75 GCHQ workers told the Economist \nthat morale was at 'an all-time low', and because of this the \nagency was working at only 80 per cent of its normal volume. \nIn some of the outstations like Hong Kong, many of the Radio \nOperators just put their feet up and drew their pay. Most were \nagreed that the main fault lay with Margaret Thatcher. Whether \nright or wrong in principle, the government handled GCHQ \nwith astonishing heavy-handedness and inflexibility.76 The \n436 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \narguments would drag on until 1997, when the trade union \nban was reversed by the incoming Labour government of Tony \nBlair. Meanwhile, the secret activities of GCHQ received enor\u00ad\nmous pUblicity.77 Geoffrey Howe, in a remarkably honest assess\u00ad\nment, conceded that: 'Almost every aspect of the work and \nlocation of GCHQ was rehearsed again and again in the press. \nOur most secret service had become almost the most public.'78 \n22 \nNSA and the Zircon Project \nThatcher said 'we will strain every sinew' to have Zircon. \nPeter Marychurch, Director of GCHQ, 1 May 19871 \nOn 24 January 1985 the American space shuttle Discovery was \nlaunched from Cape Canaveral. So far there had been fifteen \nshuttle launches, but this particular flight was unique. It was \nthe first shuttle to be deployed on an intelligence mission, and \nit carried a highly secret new sigint satellite code-named 'Orion'. \nWeighing almost six thousand pounds, the satellite was guided \nfrom the cargo bay by two military astronauts before being \npowered into its final orbit by rocket boosters. Once there, it \nunfurled two massive parabolic antennae that looked like huge \numbrellas, each stretching out more than a hundred yards. One \nof these collected signals, including low-power radio transmis\u00ad\nsions that no sigint satellite had hitherto been able to hear. The \nother beamed the 'take' back to earth. The United States had \nbeen operating sigint satellites for more than twenty years, but \nthis was by far the most powerful and impressive example, \nconfirming the status of the USA as the world's premier intel\u00ad\nligence collector. 2 \nSigint satellites, rather like fibre-optic cables and then personal \ncomputers, were part of an unstoppable world communications \nrevolution.3 These technical breakthroughs had profound impli\u00ad\ncations for sigint, and on both sides of the Atlantic intelligence \nchiefs recognised that this was changing the UKUSA alliance \nrelationship. As a result of the growth of satellite collection, \n438 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nGCHQ was working more closely with NSA than ever before, \nnotably by processing about 15 per cent of the 'overhead' mate\u00ad\nrial in its highly secret J-Ops section. Yet, paradoxically, GCHQ \nwas also being left behind, and the underlying feeling was one \nof growing 'unspecialness'. Indeed, with the possibility of \nmachine translation beckoning, there was even a danger that \nthe Americans might eventually view GCHQ as expendable. \nTherefore, in the 1980s both GCHQ and NSA were reconsid\u00ad\nering their intelligence alliances, not only with each other, but \nalso with the long-established 'second party' members of the \noriginal UKUSA agreements such as New Zealand, and even \nwith the 'third party' sigint services in Western Europe, such \nas Sweden's FRA and Germany's BND. \nAny venture into space meant tough political as well as tech\u00ad\nnical choices. In the mid-1960s Harold Wilson's Cabinet had \nopted for the British-made Skynet military communication satel\u00ad\nlite, instead of GCHQ's preferred option of an American-made \nmodel. Whether to buy cheap and reliable from the Americans, \nor to invest in expensive British national capacity (and jobs), \nor indeed even to join with the Europeans, was a perennial \nissue. The same dilemma of dependence or independence \npresented itself in other high-tech areas such as nuclear weapons \nand computing, as had recently been illustrated most starkly by \na further British venture into space code-named 'Chevaline'. \nThis was a programme to upgrade Britain's Polaris nuclear \nmissiles by improving the final stage of the rocket -in effect a \nsmall space-ship -that carried the warhead on the last part of \nits journey towards its target. Chevaline was the direct precursor \nof Britain's remarkable adventure with a sigint satellite called \n'Zircon' in the 1980s. \nBritain's main nuclear deterrent consisted of American-made \nPolaris missiles carried on submarines. No sooner had Britain \ntaken delivery of Polaris than it started to look outdated. The \nRussians and Americans had begun to experiment with elabo\u00ad\nrate anti-ballistic-missile systems to defend their cities, threat\u00ad\nening a new spiral in the arms race. Unless Britain's Polaris \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 439 \nmissiles were either replaced or upgraded, they would most \nlikely be defeated by Moscow's anti-missile defences, rendering \nBritain's independent nuclear deterrent implausible. The ability \nto hit Moscow was considered to be the key criterion for an \neffective British deterrent.4 Throughout the early 1970s British \ndefence chiefs pressed for the purchase of a new American \nmissile called 'Poseidon', with mUltiple warheads powerful \nenough to overwhelm Soviet defences. One of the reasons they \nwanted to buy American was because they had always recog\u00ad\nnised that 'Without US intelligence support any nuclear deter\u00ad\nrent system wou.ld lose credibility in a few years.'5 In other \nwords, access to American sigint was vital for targeting British \nnuclear weapons. \nHowever, Britain's political leaders had recognised that there \nwould be a diplomatic furore if Britain bought Poseidon. The \ncountry had just entered the Common Market and the French \nwould certainly not appreciate such a public reaffirmation of \nthe 'special relationship' at this crucial moment. Accordingly, \nin late 1973 the Edward Heath government rejected the Poseidon \noption and chose a British programme to update and improve \nthe ageing Polaris missiles, code-named 'Chevaline'. At the time, \nofficials believed that this code name was French for a nimble \nmountain goat. In fact, when the Chevaline saga unravelled \nsome years later in the House of Commons, it turned out that \nits true meaning was either someone who sells rotten horse \nflesh, or an ugly woman. There was considerable humour at \nthe government's expense.6 \nBritain's defence scientists were delighted by the Chevaline \ndecision, which effectively gave them their own mini-space \nprogramme and a substantial secret budget for advanced science. \nSome defence intelligence experts were less impressed. Louis \nLe Bailly, Director General of Intelligence at the Ministry of \nDefence, was working closely with the CIA, and enjoyed the \nbest insights into the Russian anti-ballistic-missile systems which \nChevaline was supposed to defeat. He was not optimistic about \nits chances: 'I personally laboured with my advisers for the best \n440 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \npart of six months to transpose this deeply technical data into \nlayman's language so that my colleagues on the JIC could under\u00ad\nstand its impact, which I believed to be profound.' However, at \nthe last moment senior scientists persuaded the Cabinet Secretary \nto have intelligence reports criticising the Chevaline decision \nwithdrawn from circulation. The chairman of the Joint \nIntelligence Committee was reportedly 'almost prostrate with \nhysteria'.7 In protest, on 17 July 1974 Le Bailly handed in his \nresignation to the Cabinet Office Intelligence Coordinator. \nChevaline was quite simply the hottest defence issue of the \ndecade.8 \nIt was also very secret. In March 1974, when a Labour govern\u00ad\nment took over from Edward Heath, Harold Wilson was anxious \nto hide the project from his own backbenchers, who were not \nat all sympathetic to nuclear weapons. Indeed, Wilson even hid \nit from some of his Cabinet Ministers. Therefore, despite the \nhuge sums involved, the existence of Chevaline was not revealed \nto the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, or indeed \nreported to Parliament in any way. \nMeanwhile, the super-secret programme was not going well. \nFor years Chevaline, which was effectively a mini-space capsule \nthat provided a new front end for Britain's Polaris missiles, was \ntest fired but failed to work properly. The cost escalated from \nan initial \u00a3175 million to \u00a3600 million, and then \u00a3800 million. \nIn 1982, when the highly secret programme was finally exposed, \nthere was an almighty row, not least because both front benches \nhad been involved in an elaborate deception of Parliament. \nOfficials had to confess that they had conspired to spend close \nto a billion pounds in complete secrecy on a failed project. This \nwas a major public scandal, since Parliament was supposed to \ncontrol major expenditure. Shortly afterward, a special 'Never \nAgain' agreement was drawn up, with officials promising faith\u00ad\nfully not to hide large defence projects from Parliament.9 \nThe 'Never Again' agreement did not last long. The cause of its \ndemise was GCHQ's desire to venture into space. By late 1983, \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 441 \nBritain's alliance relationships were being re-examined in the \nlight of the recent Falldands War. Once Alexander Haig's effort \nto find a peaceful compromise had ended in late April 1982, \nAmerican military assistance had flowed towards the British in \nvast quantities. The rapid provision of the latest American \nSidewinder air-to-air missiles for the Royal Navy's Harrier jets \nalone had done much to decide the war in Britain's favour. \nCasper Weinberger, the American Secretary of Defense, had \ngone so far as to say that if Britain lost an aircraft carrier, he \nwould happily provide a replacement. The same applied broadly \nto intelligence assistance, and during the war some of the corri\u00ad\ndors in the CIA headquarters at Langley in Virginia were actu\u00ad\nally decked out in Union Jack bunting. Yet in Cheltenham, \nGCHQ's evaluation of the 'special relationship' was somewhat \nmixed. Imagery satellites were not especially helpful because of \nthe almost complete cloud cover over the Falklands during the \nSouth Atlantic winter. For sigint coverage, GCHQ had pleaded \nfor the use of an NSA listening satellite that was then focused \non Central America, supporting the Contra struggle against El \nSalvador and Nicaragua, which was of high importance to the \nReagan administration. In order to cover the Falklands the satel\u00ad\nlite had to be moved, and NSA was willing to do this for only \na few hours a day. Persuading it to do even this much had taken \na good deal of argument on the part of GCHQ's Director, Brian \nTovey.1O \nGCHQ now had to face some unpalatable facts. It had been \nleft behind in space, which was clearly the future of sigint. \nGiven that sigint provided more than 80 per cent of Britain's \nintelligence, and took a similar proportion of the budget, this \nwas a serious matter, conjuring up the possibility that during \nsome future crisis the United States might be unwilling or unable \nto divert its resources to help Britain, either because they differed \non an issue politically, or because NSA was preoccupied else\u00ad\nwhere. All the senior staff at Cheltenham recalled Kissinger's \nsinister attempts to 'cut off' the intelligence flow to Britain in \nAugust 1973, and even now a similar spat was looming between \n442 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nthe United States and New Zealand. Thus, in his last year as \nGCHQ Director the el1ergetic Brian Tovey proposed that Britain \nshould launch its own sigint spy satellite, code-named 'Zircon'. \nHe reasoned that GCHQ was judged to have performed well \nduring the Falklands War, so this was the right moment to press \nMargaret Thatcher for a substantial reward. Zircon was bound \nto be very expensive. Like the Nimrod Rl in the 1970s, it could \nnot be accommodated within the routine 'Cost of Sigint' budget. \nSome have estimated that the satellite and its associated ground \ninstallations might have cost \u00a3500 million over five years, and \nthereafter it would need replacing. I I \nMany believe that Zircon had originally been conceived by \nBrian Tovey 'to keep the special relationship sweet' and to take \nhis organisation into spaceY However, others have read it as a \ndeep questioning of the 'special relationship'. As Bill adorn, \nDirector of NSA after 1985, put it, 'You do not invest all that \nmoney in a satellite system if you believe that the Americans \nwill continue to give it to you for free. That would be plain \nstupid.'13 Some believed that GCHQ's satellite venture was part \nof a radical new strategy. Tovey was sympathetically disposed \ntowards some of the European 'third parties', such as Germany \nand Holland, and had provided them with more material than \nwas generally realised. In particular, he enjoyed a good rela\u00ad\ntionship with the charismatic Alexandre de Marenches, head of \nthe French secret intelligence service, SDECE.14 It is not incon\u00ad\nceivable that Zircon was about GCHQ becoming the biggest fish \nin a European pool. A sigint satellite like Zircon, working in \ncooperation with the French satellite imagery programme, would \nhave made Europe a serious intelligence collector. At the very \nleast, Zircon guaranteed Britain an alternative option at a time \nwhen the European 'third parties' were becoming more powerful \nand influential. 15 Indeed, the Europeans had recently set up their \nown mini-UKUSA alliance called 'The Ring of Five', consisting \nof the sigint agencies of Germany, the Netherlands, France, \nBelgium and Denmark -although this did not prevent them from \nintercepting and reading each other's communications traffic.16 \nThe Blue Pete1' team \nadmire Britain's first \nSkynet communications \nsatellite in November \n1969.

'The Doughnut', \nGCHQ's new building \nat Cheltenham which \nwas opened in 2003. \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 443 \nThe idea of GCHQ teaming up with the Europeans was not \na bad one. European sigint services such as those of the \nNorwegians, the Germans and the Dutch were highly profes\u00ad\nsional, and had made many important contributions to Western \nintelligence down the years, not least during the Falklands War. \nThey often displayed brilliant lateral thinking. When Soviet \nnaval ships entered Dutch harbours in the 1980s, their hosts \nwould often complain that the Soviet radar was interfering with \nlocal television broadcasts and insist on a snap technical inspec\u00ad\ntion. The crafty Dutch used this opportunity to plant a small \ntracking device high up on the Soviet ships that was no more \nthan the size of a brick. This tracking device was so successful \nthat it became a standard technique across the Western secret \nservices. Typically, a small group of British SBS personnel worked \nwith SIS and GCHQ on similar tasks in the 1990s.17 \nGCHQ's relationship with its American partner was about \npeople as well as projects. General Bill Odom arrived as the \nnew Director of NSA in March 1985. Odom was a tough-talking \nArmy officer with an extremely abrupt manner. He saw himself \nas a new broom, complaining that his predecessor 'would not \nfavour radical change' and that the staff at NSA were 'too laid\u00ad\nback'.JB He also looked afresh at the Anglo-American sigint rela\u00ad\ntionship, and was deeply unimpressed, observing that 'The name \nof the British game is to show up with one card and expect to \ncall all the shots.'i9 Ingenious old-fashioned British cryptanalysis \nwas being overtaken by the raw power of America's Cray super\u00ad\ncomputers, and this had been underlined by some remarkable \nNSA breakthroughs with Soviet high-grade diplomatic traffic in \nthe late 1970s.20 Odom noted that, 'What the British brought \nin World War II, they do not bring any more ... Today, this \nbusiness requires huge investment, and Britain doesn't have \nthat.' Britain's decision to buy Zircon signalled GCHQ's renewed \ncommitment to spend big money on sigint.21 \nBill Odom's first year as Director at NSA was a traumatic one. \nWashington soon dubbed 1985 'the Year of the Spy', since it \nbrought the exposure of Ronald Pelton, a damaging mole who \n444 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nworked in 'A5', NSA's sensitive Soviet section. With a photo\u00ad\ngraphic memory, Pelton proved even more disastrous to Western \ncode-breaking than Geoffrey Prime. At almost the same time \nthe Walker family, a whole group of spies working within US \nnaval intelligence and communications, was uncovered. Edward \nLee Howard, a CIA officer, was also revealed to be working for \nthe Russians. To cap it all, in November 1985 it was discovered \nthat Jonathan Pollard, a Mossad spy inside the Pentagon, had \nbeen handing over very sensitive material to the Israelis. The \nAmericans had not yet uncovered the two best covert sources \nemployed by the Soviets, namely a CIA officer called Aldrich \nAmes and an FBI officer, Robert Hanssen.22 These frightening \ncases of KGB espionage had a direct impact on the British, since \nthey made Bill Odom all the keener to see the polygraph \ndeployed by GCHQ at Cheltenham.23 \nAlongside KGB espionage, the other big issue of the time was \nrelations between the Western sigint allies. In 1985 the United \nStates cut off the intelligence flow to New Zealand, one of the \n'second party' members of UKUSA. Similarly to the 'cut-off' \nthat Kissinger had imposed on Britain in 1973, this was trig\u00ad\ngered by wider defence issues, rather than sigint specifically. \nNew Zealand was sensitive about nuclear weapons, given that \nthe south-west Pacific had been used for many years by both \nthe Americans and the French as an atomic test zone. In 1985 \nDavid Lange's Labour government introduced a general ban on \nships carrying nuclear weapons entering New Zealand's \nharbours. This effectively excluded many American naval vessels \nwhich routinely carried nuclear depth charges. Washington was \nkeen to deter other countries from following a similar course -\nperhaps creating a Pacific nuclear-free zone -and earmarked \nNew Zealand for exemplary punishment. Intelligence was the \nchosen instrument.24 \nA remarkable confrontation now occurred. Paul Cleveland, \nthe American Ambassador in Wellington, informed Lange that \nhenceforth his country would not be receiving NSA's precious \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 445 \nsigint jewels. Lange responded tartly that they were not jewels \nby any means, and the intelligence cut-off was probably a good \nthing, since he would now 'have more time to do the cross\u00ad\nword'.25 Cleveland, flabbergasted by Lange's sangfroid, got to \nwork on some of his Cabinet colleagues. He asked David Caygill, \nthe Finance Minister, whether he realised quite how important \nthe intelligence issue was. Caygill recalls, 'I asked him what he \nmeant,' and Cleveland responded that it was all about 'trust', \nexplaining that the UKUSA intelligence alliance depended on \nmutual confidence, and now that had completely evaporated. \n'We have not spied on each other: continued Cleveland. 'If you \ngo ahead with your policies we will not be able to trust you.' \nCaygill later explained to Lange that what the American \nAmbassador had meant was that 'The US would no longer feel \nany inhibition in conducting intelligence-gathering operations \nagainst US.'26 The new Director at GCHQ, Peter Marychurch, \nwas particularly upset by this rift, having just spent a couple of \nyears attached to New Zealand's sigint agency, the Government \nCommunications Security Bureau (GCSB). \nHitherto, relations between New Zealand's GCSB and its bigger \npartners, GCHQ and NSA, had been close. Highly sensitive mate\u00ad\nrial, recently released only by accident, affords us a rare glimpse \nof their joint activities. When Helen Bain, the political editor of \nthe New Zealand newspaper the Sunday Star-Times, asked for \npermission to look at Lange's papers from when he had been \nPrime Minister, which had just arrived in the archives in \nWellington, she was supposed to be given individual files, but \nby mistake an entire unsorted box was handed over. This \ncontained a highly classified annual report from the mid-1980s \nthat revealed the relationship of GCSB with its allies.27 Working \nclosely with NSA and GCHQ, the New Zealanders were actu\u00ad\nally devoting much of their time to spying on allies, friends and \nneutrals. In 1985 New Zealand was reading diplomatic telegrams \nand telephone satellite communications from France, Japan and \nthe Philippines, as well as a host of South Pacific island states. \nIt was also intercepting the communications of some United \n446 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nNations organisations in the Pacific, together with those of non\u00ad\ngovernmental organisations such as Greenpeace.28 \nIn many cases NSA or GCHQ provided 'raw traffic' that was \nof interest to the New Zealanders, or which matched their trans\u00ad\nlation skills. A great deal of attention had been given to Japanese \ncommunications by the three partners. New Zealand's GCSB \nhad produced 238 intelligence reports on Japanese diplomatic \ncables, using 'raw traffic from GCHQ/NSA sources'. However, \nit lamented that the recent implementation of a new high -grade \nJapanese cypher machine had seriously reduced its output. \nDiplomatic traffic from Fiji, Vietnam and Laos was being inter\u00ad\ncepted, as was South African military traffic and Argentinean \nnaval traffic. The GCSB relied heavily on the collection capa\u00ad\nbilities of its British and American allies to provide French \ncommunications that were out of range of its own monitoring \nstations. American overhead satellites, including the new 'Orion', \nwere crucial in this respect. After the Greenpeace ship Rainbow \nWarrior was attacked and sunk in Auckland harbour by the \nFrench secret intelligence service in July 1985, killing one of \nits crew, GCSB set in train a special collection effort in the \nregion. NSA and GCHQ were asked to monitor targets in France, \nincluding certain Paris telephone lines. In short, all three allies \nworked closely together on a very wide range of targets, so, \ndespite Lange's apparent insouciance, New Zealand had in fact \nlost valuable material as a result of being banished in 1985.29 \nBoth GCHQ and the Australian sigint agency, DSD, did their \nbest to subvert the American ban by supplying the New \nZealanders with sigint of their own.30 \nAs had been the case with the Kissinger 'cut-off' in August \n1973, NSA also worked gently to subvert the ban, and over \ntime came to ignore it. In return, New Zealand agreed to host \nmore elaborate satellite receiving stations on behalf of NSA. \nNevertheless, in the short term this confrontation had profound \neffects on all the venerable Commonwealth countries which \nhad helped to found the UKUSA sigint alliance and were known \nas the 'second parties'. Odom now pondered some big ques-\nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 447 \ntions, writing in his notebook: 'If 2nd party status disappears -\nWhat then?' He complained that Britain, Canada and Australia \nhad made a fuss and tended to 'over do [the] banishing of NZ', \nbut he also understoocl that they wished to be supportive of \ntheir Commonwealth ally.31 The situation also created fiendishly \ncomplex problems, because UKUSA sigint had become so closely \nwired together in the 1980s. Peter Hunt, Director of Canada's \nsigint agency, the CSE, asked Odom's advice about what to do \nwith 'integrees', staff on loan from New Zealand's GCSB who \nwere embedded in the headquarters of his own organisation in \nattawa.32 \nThis turbulence in Western sigint relations only seemed to \nconfirm the wisdom of GCHQ's decision to develop Zircon, \noffering Britain some measure of independence in the realm of \nsigint. Although NSA did not like the Pentagon decision to cut \nNew Zealand off, in the 1980s there was general American disil\u00ad\nlusionment with all the UKUSA 'second parties' -especially \nwith Canada. In the summer of 1985 Peter Hunt confessed that \nhe had been having great difficulty persuading Canadian policy\u00ad\nmakers of the value of CSE's sigint product, although this situ\u00ad\nation was now improving. Despite the fact that CSE had been \nhelping NSA and GCHQ with increased covert collection from \nCanadian Embassies, when Odom met officials from the US \nEmbassy in Ottawa to discuss intelligence cooperation they all \nagreed 'how poor the Canadian effort is!,33 By contrast, NSA \nwas increasingly impressed by the West European 'third parties', \nlike the West Germans, who were achieving very good results \nagainst the diplomatic traffic of Eastern Europe countries like \nCzechoslovakia, using ground stations.34 \nIn 1985 adorn decided to make improved NSA relations with \nthe West Germans a high priority. Hitherto NSA had hesitated, \nsince the German foreign intelligence service, the BND, was \nknown to be penetrated by Eastern Bloc spies. But after the \nGeoffrey Prime affair in Britain and the damaging Pelton, Walker \nand Howard cases in the United States, the German security \n448 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nproblems seemed less unique. 'Sure, we knew they were leaky: \nrecalls Odom, 'but we felt we had a way of compartmentalising \nsigint carefully to deal with this.' What mattered to him was \nthat the Germans were investing more and more money in \nsigint, and were becoming a bigger player in Europe. They had \nalready demonstrated their technical proficiency in some excel\u00ad\nlent electronic warfare projects conducted jointly with Israel. In \nthe pragmatic world of sigint alliances, diversifying partners \nmade perfect sense. However, GCHQ 'went up the wall' when \nthey heard about it, Odom recalled with a wry grin, 'since it \nundermined their specialness'. 35 \nOne of the top priorities for any Director of GCHQ is to ensure \nsmooth dealings with NSA. Relations between intelligence chiefs \nare often rather personal. For example, 'Pat' Carter, who had \nbeen Director of NSA in the late 1970s, was exceedingly \nanglophile, and established a happy bond with his opposite \nnumber at GCHQ, Joe Hooper. By contrast, Bill Odom took an \ninitial dislike to Peter Marychurch, who he referred to as 'the \nSheep'. Indeed, Odom hated all the qualities that had prompted \nWhitehall to choose Marychurch. Following the tenure of his \ngung-ho predecessor Brian Tovey, GCHQ wanted a more stable \nand avuncular figure. Marychurch was not a great intellectual, \nbut he was an effective administrator and a good diplomat. After \nhe had spent a period of time as GCHQ's representative in New \nZealand, some were surprised to see him recalled to become \nDirector. He had spent less time in London than many of his \ncontemporaries, and so seemed rather disconnected from the \nbig defence debates of the day. By contrast, Bill Odom prided \nhimself on his intellectual toughness and his ability to talk global \nstrategy, having been the right-hand man to Zbigniew Brzezinski, \nPresident Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser.36 \nOne of the reasons Odom liked the West Germans was that \nthey agreed with him that NATO armed forces in Europe had \nlong been starved of sigint. Under existing rules, only when war \nactually broke out would high-grade sigint from UKUSA be \nreleased to the West Europeans and also pushed forward to \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 449 \ncommanders on the front line. The lack of current sigint support \nfor front-line units was not only causing problems in Germany. \nOne of the commanders of the main US sigint station in South \nKorea confided to Odom that there too, 'The requirements of \nthe field commander were their lowest priority,' and that 'NSA \nfought every attempt to collect and disseminate \"tactical\" intel\u00ad\nligence' to military formations. Bill Odom was a soldier at heart, \nand he wanted current sigint to reach those who would be in \nthe front line if a major war ever broke out.37 \nIn the early summer of 1985 Odom set out on a European \ntour to press this personal agenda. He took with him Peter \nAldridge, Director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the \nagency which provided America's spy satellites. On 7 June they \nmet Peter Marychurch in Cheltenham, and discussed progress \non Britain's Zircon sigint satellite. Marychurch was forced to \nadmit that GCHQ was hitting problems, partly of cost and partly \nof competency. This was likely to delay the project, and also \npushed the British towards the use of more US contractors, for \nwhich he needed to ask their permission.38 One of the ironies \nof so-called 'British' space defence projects was that while they \nwere supposed to increase national independence, they often \nneeded backdoor American technical support to get them off \nthe ground.39 There were other irritants in the relationship. \nNSA's largest base overseas, Menwith Hill, set as it was on a \nremote spot on the Yorkshire moors, was proving to be an espe\u00ad\ncially unpopular posting with NSA personnel, and Bill Odom \nnoted that there were too few volunteers and too many \ndraftees.4o The substantial cost of NSA sigint bases in Britain \nwas a further factor that pushed him towards Continental \nEurope, since the price of operating from West Germany was \nlower.41 \nBritain's Zircon satellite was also rattling Odom's cage. A few \ndays after his meetings with Marychurch he chewed over the \nwhole matter of Anglo-American cooperation in a discussion \nwith Dick Kern, NSA's liaison officer in Britain. Odom expressed \nthe view that the relationship with GCHQ 'had grown too big', \n450 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nand 'needed to be managed better'. They agreed that the Zircon \nprogramme was an unwanted intrusion into the realm of space, \nwhich they did not want to share with any of their allies, and \nthis was viewed as a problem. Ultimately, NSA wanted to mono\u00ad\npolise the Western flow of sigint from space, giving America the \n'potential to turn off the flow in future'. adorn and Kern both \nfelt that they needed to reconsider certain areas of cooperation \nwith GCHQ, including the 'integration of personnel'. All this \nwas to be offset by improving relations with third parties like \nthe Germans.42 \nA week later, Bill adorn headed to Bergen in Norway for a \n'European Principals Meeting', an annual gathering of all the \nsigint chiefs in Western Europe, hosted this year by the Norwegian \nChief of Intelligence, Rear Admiral Jan Ingebrigtsen. Significantly, \nthe members of this elite club only stretched as far south as \nFrance, since NSA equated the reliability of sigint partners in \nEurope with their distance from the Mediterranean. The Greeks \nranked bottom in this hierarchy, since their communications \nwere known to be horrifically insecure. adorn was like a social \nanthropologist, and enjoyed recording the 'traditional national \nsuspicions and jealousies' displayed by the cast of characters at \nthe meeting in his daily log. He liked his Norwegian host, who \nhe found 'pleasant, dignified, and pro-American'. He also warmed \nto the Germans, who had come forward with a 'most construc\u00ad\ntive proposal' which most of the group was ready to accept. \nHowever, the British, he noted, 'can't accept happily their own \nloss of pre-eminence in this business' .43 adorn was especially \nfond of the German chief, Eberhard Blum, remarking that they \n'had a good talk, some good laughs, and a few reminiscences'. \nBlum, he noted, was inclined to defend NSA, even when other \nWest German officials complained of the Americans' 'Big Brother' \napproach, arguing that in fact they had always dealt fairly and \ngenerously with their smaller sigint partners. However, Blum . \nwas coming up for retirement, and adorn recorded sadly that \nwhile his German colleagues shared his views, they were rather \nmore hesitant when it came to 'putting down the British'.44 \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 451 \nThe 'most constructive proposal' that the BND had brought \nforward was a scheme code-named 'Sigdasys', which aimed \nto improve the flow of operational sigint to NATO's front-line \ncommanders in Europe.45 Peter Marychurch was dead against \nit, since the British had long been hesitant about sharing sigint \nwith military units in peacetime.46 Ironically, Sigdasys was just \nwhat the British Army's electronic warfare operators on the \nfront line had been requesting for years. This was because \ntheir own short-range 'Y' units were having a tough time \nlistening in on the Soviets, since Warsaw Pact radio security \nhad continually improved, making eavesdropping difficult. \n'Traditionally: they noted, 'the signal intercept service has \nbeen the primary source of tactical intelligence: but now its \nvalue was fading as Soviet divisional headquarters refined \ntheir communications securityY By the 1980s, tactical listen\u00ad\ning was reduced to direction-finding work against front-line \nformations.48 \nGCHQ's trenchant opposition to the German proposals at \nBergen brought out Bill adorn's intense dislike of Peter \nMarychurch. On 11 June adorn went home, and penned his \nthoughts on the various European sigint chiefs, including the \nDirector of GCHQ: \n* Peter Marychurch, my UK counterpart, is the least attrac-\ntive of the lot. A tense, nervous, slightly insecure civil \nservant, he has as his main task to stay fully entangled \nwith the US system, to try and act as our equivalent in \nEurope, to stand between us and the other Europeans if \npossible. He and his immediate subordinates hold, in my \nview, a vastly inflated view of their own competence and \ntalents.49 \n* Predictably, the abrasive adorn had got his way at Bergen, and \nnoted with ill-disguised delight that this would 'embarrass the \nGCHQ coalition'. Conflict, he wrote, 'abounds in our bilateral \nties' with GCHQ at every point, including resources, security \n452 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nand UKUSA third party rules. Re-evaluating the Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican sigint relationship was now a higher priority. For the \nAmericans, the key question was whether geographic access to \nBritain and its overseas bases was worth the cost. In his own \nmind Odom had already answered the question, adding that \nthe USA was not getting very much in return for 'this exces\u00ad\nsively entangled bilateral connection'.50 A notoriously impatient \nman, he now observed: 'Socially, I no longer find the British \namusing, merely a pain in the ass.'51 \nOdom was a soldier with very considerable military experi\u00ad\nence' and he wanted to see sigint used to support fighting. He \nwas absolutely correct about the need to push sigint further \nforward, a lesson underlined by Britain's own experience in the \nFalklands and again in the Gulf in 1991, where operational \ncommanders were indifferently served. Odom had been instru\u00ad\nmental in the development of the US Army's Intelligence Support \nActivity, an innovative special forces unit that combined SAS\u00ad\ntype operations with short-range sigint. This unit, which made \nuse of listening equipment in helicopters, had been used success\u00ad\nfully in Italy during the mid -1980s as part of efforts to find the \nNATO commander General James Dozier, who had been \nkidnapped by leftist terrorists. 52 Odom was always keen to see \nsigint actually used in the field. Typically, in June 1985 he pushed \nhard to use it tactically against the New People's Army, a Marxist \nguerrilla group in the Philippines.53 \nHowever, Odom was impulsive, and had only come to the \nworld of sigint recently. By contrast, the affable Peter \nMarychurch had spent decades at GCHQ, and knew more about \nthe complex world of secret listening. It was soon clear that \nMarychurch also knew much more about the hazards of working \nwith the West Germans. Only a month after the Bergen meeting, \nOdom's close friend Eberhard Blum retired as President of the \nBND, to be succeeded by Heribert Hellenbroich, the long-serving \nand respected head of Germany's domestic security service, the \nBfV. At forty-eight years old, Hellenbroich seemed set to follow \nan upward path, not dissimilar to that of Britain's famed \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 453 \nspymaster Dick White, who had successfully headed MI5 and \nthen SIS. Alas, this was not to be. On 27 August 1985 the BfV \nwas hit by an extraordinary spy scandal when one of \nHellenbroich's immediat~ subordinates, who was also a close \nfriend, defected to East Germany. This triggered a general panic, \nwith some of the West's most valuable agents in East Germany \nhurriedly defecting in the other direction, for fear that their \nidentities had been compromised and their lives were in danger. \nThe West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ordered an inquiry, \nwhich discovered that Hellenbroich had kept his friend in his \npost despite his notoriously heavy drinking and personal prob\u00ad\nlems. Hellenbroich was summarily dismissed, becoming the \nshortest-serving BND chief in the agency's history. 54 \nThe West German defection had direct repercussions for both \nMI5 and GCHQ. For some time MI5 had been mounting covert \nsurveillance on an unremarkable rented house at 249 Waye \nAvenue in Cranford, near Heathrow Airport on the western edge \nof London. This was inhabited by Reinhard and Sonja Schulze, \na quiet German couple in their mid-thirties who worked respec\u00ad\ntively as a kitchen designer and a translator. In fact they were \nagents of the East German foreign intelligence agency, the HVA. \nUnusually, they were 'illegals' -in other words they lived under \ndeep cover, rather than pretending to be Eastern Bloc diplomats. \nAt the same time as the BfV security flap in West Germany, the \nMetropolitan Police Special Branch raided the house and the \nSchulzes were arrested. Specialists then spent several weeks \nripping up floorboards and dismantling every item in the house. \nThey were not disappointed. In the garden shed they found \nwallets with one-time pads for encyphering and decyphering \nmessages, together with a radio receiver. There was also an escape \nkit with money and false passports. The authorities had moved \nquickly because they feared that the Schulzes might flee, joining \nthe flurry of anxious double agents moving between East and \nWest.55 GCHQ had been reading many of the messages that the \nagents received in high-frequency Morse. This breakthrough was \na great achievement for Cheltenham, a mini-version of Venona. \n454 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nIn contrast to Venona, which was never used in court, GCHQ \nintercepts of the HVA communications were cited as prosecu\u00ad\ntion evidence when the Schulzes came to trial in June 1987, \nensuring that they each received ten years in prison. 56 \nSurprisingly, adorn was not deterred by these serious secur\u00ad\nity problems within the West German intelligence services, and \ncontinued to press ahead with his German plan. There were \nbureaucratic obstacles, since the BND was engaged in a fierce \nturf battle over tactical sigint with the West German Army which \nclosely resembled the tussles between NSA and America's own \narmed forces.57 Nevertheless, by the summer of 1986 NSA, the \nBND and indeed GCHQ were building the new Sigdasys system \nproposed by the Germans, which gave a better supply of sigint \nto NATO operational commanders and allowed partners to pool \ntheir military sigint on the Soviets. This was paid for on a three\u00ad\nway split between the British, the Americans and the Germans, \nwith the French joining soon after.58 In September 1987 Peter \nMarychurch suggested the Swedish FRA join as a 'sleeping \npartner', since Sigdasys was saving costs for everyone by elim\u00ad\ninating overlap.59 The Americans continued to be impressed by \nthe BND's aggressive and expanding global sigint programme, \nfor example its cooperation with the code-breaking agency in \nTaiwan.60 \nSadly, adorn's desire to give more sigint to NATO's front-line \ndivisions was twenty years too late. By 1986 the new Russian \nPremier, Mikhail Gorhachev, was beginning to transform world \naffairs. In the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defence, Gorbachev \nwas welcomed with cautious optimism. Observers were not only \nwatching him but also the 'exceptionally able' Russian \nAmbassador in Washington, Anatoly Dobrynin, who was a \nnatural diplomat.61 Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa were \nbecoming more important to NSA, which was anxiously \nwatching the conflict in Angola between the Marxist regime \nand rebel forces of Joseph Savimbi, who received support from \nboth South Africa and the CIA. NSA was pondering how to \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 455 \nexpand its coverage of sub-Saharan Africa, and at a meeting \nwith his senior staff an 16 July 1986 adorn expressed high \nhopes of an ambitious new GCHQ covert collection operation \nthat was being mounted from the British Embassy in Luanda, \nthe Angolan capital. He also pondered using more sigint ships, \nand asking the BND to do some work in southern Africa. South \nAfrica's communications security was improving, with burst \ntransmission and frequency-hopping, forcing GCHQ and NSA \nto concentrate on clear voice traffic.62 \nTerrorism was now an extremely high-profile concern, with \nLibya the main focus because it was directly aiding terrorist \ngroups in the West, including the IRA. Indeed, a low-level war \nwith Libya was gradually developing. During the early 1980s \nthe eccentric Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, had \nbecome increasingly paranoid about dissidents and exiles who \nopposed his regime. After hanging two students outside the \ngates of Tripoli University, he had ordered his secret service to \nattack what he called 'stray dogs' abroad, resulting in a series \nof bombings and shootings against opposition groups based in \nBritain. With the help of MIS, three Libyan assassins were caught \nand sentenced to life imprisonment. Some of these attacks had \nbeen organised from within the Libyan Embassy at S St James's \nSquare in London, now renamed the 'Libyan People's Bureau'. \nGCHQ was decoding Libyan communications freely, and during \nthe early 1980s it had intercepted several of Gaddafi's alarming \nmessages demanding violent action.63 \nHowever, on the morning of Tuesday, 17 April 1984 the British \nauthorities were taken unawares by a new wave of violence. \nSeventy-five demonstrators were protesting outside the Libyan \nPeople's Bureau over the recent execution of further students \nin Tripoli who had been critical of Gaddafi, and the police were \ntrying to keep them separate from an angry group of pro-Gaddafi \nloyalists. At 10.18 a.m. a prolonged burst of automatic fire from \ntwo Sterling sub-machine guns came from the windows of the \nLibyan People's Bureau, resulting in the death of twenty-five\u00ad\nyear-old WPC Yvonne Fletcher. Eleven demonstrators were also \n456 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \ninjured. A former MI5 officer, Annie Machon, has claimed that \nGCHQ had advance warning of the incident. Cheltenham was \nstill successfully reading communications between Gaddafi's \noffice in Tripoli and the People's Bureau, and one message, inter\u00ad\ncepted on the day before the shooting, asked loyal Libyans 'to \nopen fire on the dissidents'. Machon would write: \n* As a prior warning of a possible attack, it was very useful \nintelligence or would have been, if it had been handed on \nin a timely fashion. But it wasn't as the nine-to-five bureau\u00ad\ncrats at GCHQ had gone home for the night. As a result \nthe report did not go to the police or MI5 that day. In the \nmeantime WPC Yvonne Fletcher was fatally shot from the \nwindow of the LPB [Libyan People's Bureau].64 \n* The recent authorised history of MI5 largely confirms this highly \ncontroversial claim. What GCHQ had actually intercepted the \nprevious day was a telex sent by staff within the Libyan People's \nBureau to Tripoli, discussing possible means of dealing with \nthe planned demonstrations by exiles and dissidents. One option \nthat they suggested was: 'To fire on them from within the \nBureau.' In fact this intelligence was not passed to MI5 or \nthe Metropolitan Police Special Branch until the day after the \nshooting.65 The initial incident was followed by a ten-day siege \nof the embassy, after which Britain broke off diplomatic rela\u00ad\ntions with Libya. In common with a number of other terrorist \nincidents in the 1980s and 1990s, GCHQ was criticised and there \nwere internal arguments about how intelligence was circulated. \nAll this underlined the new challenge of dealing with terrorism, \nwhich required responses in 'real time', something that a Cold \nWar security apparatus was not remotely accustomed to. In the \nwake of the shooting at the Libyan People's Bureau, there was \na deliberate attempt to develop resources that could work on a \ntwenty-four-hour basis and achieve the rapid response times \nrequired by counter-terrorism.66 \nIn March 1986 there was a major naval confrontation between \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 457 \nthe Americans and President Gaddafi's forces in the Gulf of \nSidra, off the coast of Libya, where the extent of territorial \nwaters was disputed. After US fighters attacked Libyan missile \nbatteries and patrol boats, Gaddafi demanded that his secret \nservices retaliate, and on 4 April Libya organised the terrorist \nbombing of La Belle discotheque in West Berlin, killing two \nAmerican servicemen. NSA had intercepted the message from \nthe head of the Libyan secret service ordering terrorist attacks \nthroughout Europe, and newspapers had already revealed that \nLibyan communications were being read, so President Ronald \nReagan decided there was nothing to be lost by using sigint \npublicly and in some detail to underline the fact that Gaddafi \nwas the culprit. Three days later, Bill adorn was told by Reagan's \nCIA chief, Bill Casey, that the President 'wants to go public with \nSIGINT on Libyan activity in Berlin -[CIA Deputy Director] \nR[obert] Gates will work out \"text\" '. However, both GCHQ and \nNSA were horrified that NSA's reading of Libyan diplomatic \ntraffic was going to be made public.67 Predictably, the Libyans \nresponded by immediately changing all their codes and cyphers, \nand they also purchased expensive new cypher machines from \nCrypto AG in Switzerland.68 \nReagan's public use of sigint to blame Gaddafi for the Berlin \ndiscotheque bombing was intended to justify a US air strike on \nTripoli. Eighteen USAF F-lll bombers took off from RAF Upper \nHeyford, but were denied overflight rights by France, Italy and \nSpain, and so were compelled to take a circuitous route to their \ntargets. One of these targets was President Gaddafi's own \ncompound. He escaped death by minutes because the Prime \nMinister of Malta warned the Libyans by telephone of the \napproaching military aircraft. However, Gaddafi's fifteen-month\u00ad\nold adopted daughter was killed and two of his sons were \ninjured.69 In 1987 the CIA, SIS and the French secret intelli\u00ad\ngence service assembled a vast mercenary army that pummelled \nGaddafi's forces during the ongoing border war between Libya \nand Chad. The conflict between Libya and the West flared again \nin December 1988 with the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over \n458 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nLockerbie in Scotland, although responsibility for this attack \nremains a matter of dispute.7o \nAlthough Bill adorn ha.d not warmed to Peter Marychurch, \nGCHQ's Director was an energetic administrator and had \nnotched up some impressive achievements in the late 1980s.71 \nHe was trying to modernise GCHQ, moving away from old\u00ad\nstyle sigint operations which used rows of people sitting in \nnissen huts with headphones on. Radio Operators who did the \nfront-line listening now had computer consoles which allowed \nthem to feed the most interesting intelligence directly into a \ncentral computer, and were using better recording equipment \ncalled 'Keepnet' and a new system that allowed them to compare \ndifferent signals, called 'Livebait'. Like most GCHQ computers, \nthe local computers -invariably Honeywells -were of American \nmanufacture, so as to be in step with NSA. The terminals used \nby each operator could hold about a million words, meaning \nthat the product could be word-searched and then distributed \nelectronically, something GCHQ had hankered after for two \ndecades.72 \nMarychurch's biggest headache was the perennial issue of \nbudgets, which slowed the recruitment of higher-grade tech\u00ad\nnical staff. 73 Money problems had also impacted on Zircon, \nperhaps Britain's most sensitive defence project during the mid-\n1980s. Bill adorn was not disappointed when Andrew Saunders, \nBritain's liaison officer within NSA at Fort Meade, confided to \nhim as early as February 1986 that in his personal opinion, as \na result of defence cuts, 'Zircon probably will gO.'74 By April \n1986 Marychurch had persuaded America's National \nReconnaissance Office to give him further assistance with Zircon. \nHowever, it now had an unnerving 'on-off' status, and under\u00ad\nstandably the British Treasury was scheming to kill off this highly \nsecret project.7S \nZircon did not remain secret for much longer. In early 1987, \nto the horror of Whitehall civil servants, the project was exposed \nby Duncan Campbell, the journalist who almost a decade before \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 459 \nhad been at the centre of the 'ABC trial'. For the past ten years \nhis investigative journalism, mostly for the New Statesman maga\u00ad\nzine, had tracked the British secret state, and he was regarded \nas a significant problem by the authorities. In November 1985 \nhe had been commissioned by BBC Scotland to make a series \nof programmes called Secret Society, and had decided to use this \nto reveal Zircon. However, it was only in the summer of 1986 \nthat he uncovered the biggest secret. Speaking to Robert Sheldon, \nthe Chair of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, \nhe discovered that Parliament knew absolutely nothing about \nthe project. The fact that this very large spending item had been \nhidden from Parliament - a reprise of the previous defence \nspending scandal over Chevaline -now became the core issue. \nMeanwhile, GCHQ had got wind of the planned documentary, \nand on 5 December 1986 there was a hurried meeting between \nPeter Marychurch and the BBC. In early January 1987 Alasdair \nMilne, the Director General of the BBC, announced that he had \nbanned the programme on grounds of national security.76 \nOn 21 January the High Court granted an injunction against \nDuncan Campbell. This restrained him from either showing the \ndocumentary or revealing any details of its contents. The next \nday the New Statesman published an article asserting that the \nreal issue was nothing less than the sovereignty of Parliament \nitself, and that a deception had been perpetrated on the Public \nAccounts Committee. Campbell tried to have the film shown \nto MPs in the House of Commons, but was prevented by the \nintransigent Speaker of the House, Bernard Weatherill.77 Then, \nover the weekend of 24-25 January the Special Branch raided \nthe offices of the BBC and the New Statesman, together with the \nhomes of Duncan Campbell and several other journalists who \nhad worked with him. There was high drama as television \ncameras filmed a search team breaking down the front door to \nCampbell's London flat.78 The New Statesman's solicitor was soon \ncontacting everyone mentioned in the programme, including \nthe GCHQ trade unions at Cheltenham, warning them that they \nmight also be raided by the local constabulary.79 \n460 INTO THE THATCHER ERA \nNigel Lawson, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, claims that \nhe had actually killed off Zircon in the autumn of 1986, some \nmonths before the Campbell story broke. 'Well before all this \nblew up: he recounts, 'I had succeeded in getting the ZIRCON \nproject cancelled on grounds of cost.' For this reason, he declares \nrather triumphantly, the satellite 'did not in any sense leave the \nground'.80 In fact, this is by no means the whole story. Whitehall \nopposition to Zircon was certainly mounting during late 1986, \nand key defence advisers had lost faith in it.81 However, Bill \nOdom's personal daily log, only recently released, makes it very \nclear that in the spring of 1987 Britain's political leaders were \nstill completely committed to some form of space-based sigint, \nand that a variant of the project -still called 'Zircon' -was \ngoing forward. Indeed, what is remarkable is the strength of \nMargaret Thatcher's continued personal commitment. In May \n1987 Peter Marychurch visited NSA and personally told Bill \nOdom: 'Thatcher says \"we will strain every sinew\" to get \nZircon.'82 \nWhat did Marychurch mean by this? By late 1986 the costs \nof Zircon were threatening to spiral out of control. Therefore, \nby the summer of 1987 he was exploring the possibility of \npurchasing a single American-built satellite 'off the shelf. \nHowever, a single satellite would not give Britain global coverage: \nthe comprehensive collection of sigint would require no fewer \nthan three satellites. By 1988 a more sensible solution had \nemerged. Britain opted to pay \u00a3500 million as a direct subscriber \nto the American satellite system. Then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey \nHowe recalls: 'Beggars can't be choosers. If you can't afford a \nwholly independent operation then you have to put in a share.' \nEach of the three latest American sigint satellites cost \u00a3500 \nmillion, and Britain effectively bought a one third time-share, \ngiving it a guaranteed supply of 'overhead' sigint. This not only \ndelivered global coverage, but also a much bigger advantage: \nquite simply the system worked well, unlike Britain's ill-fated \nspace adventures.83 Satellite experts suggest that 'Zircon', such \nas it now was, arrived in space on 4 September 1990. A Titan \nNSA AND THE ZIRCON PROJECT 461 \n34D rocket from Cape Canaveral put it in position under the \ncover of a Skynet 4C launch, and the satellite was positioned \nover Asia. \nIn some ways Zircon symbolised the increasingly awkward \nsigint partnerships of the 1980s, a curious mixture of collabor\u00ad\nation and animosity. Together with the Geoffrey Prime affair, \nthe Falklands War and the trade union issue, it underlined the \ndeep transatlantic tensions that now existed in the world of \ncode-breaking. Nevertheless, the new 'time-share' relationship \nwent down well in Washington. Brian Tovey's seemingly upstart \nbid for GCHQ independence in space had been bought off, and \nNSA breathed a sigh of relief that another power, albeit a close \nally, had not acquired its own space sigint capability. Meanwhile, \ndespite Bill Odom's bluster about Britain's failure to play in the \nbig league of sigint powers, NSA's own budgets were stretched \nto breaking point in the late 1980s. With the Cold War drawing \nto a close, many were predicting savage cuts in intelligence \nbudgets, so GCHQ's monetary contributions to the secret satel\u00ad\nlite programme were doubly welcome. Accordingly, the some\u00ad\nwhat battered GCRQ-NSA relationship marched on, out of the \nCold War and into a new era of 'hot peace'.B4 \nAFTER 1989 \nGCHQ GOES GLOBAL \n23 \nFrom Cold War to Hot Peace \nThe Gulf War and Bosnia \nWe had the place 'swept' regularly, but it made no difference. \nThat building ... was built around bugs. \nCaptain Milos Stankovic on the UN \nHeadquarters in Sarajevo' \nIntelligence organisations everywhere failed to predict the end \nof the Cold War. GCHQ and NSA certainly did not foresee it, \nnor did Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee.2 The changes that \nswept across the Warsaw Pact countries in 1989 also took \nCommunist leaders by surprise, despite the intense surveillance \nconducted within their own societies. The exact moment at \nwhich the Eastern Bloc collapsed was hard to pinpoint, because \nultimately it amounted to a failure of self-belief. Once the \nCommunist leadership was unwilling to shoot its own people, \nthe game was up. The closest anyone from Britain had come to \na prediction of the end of the Cold War was in the writings of \nthe journalist Timothy Garton Ash, reporting on the free trade \nunion 'Solidarity' in Poland in the early 1980s. Having witnessed \nthe mass defiance of the Soviets by trade unionists in the Polish \nshipyards, he had forecast that Moscow's empire might well \ncrumble in short order -and he was quite right.3 \nBizarrely, the end of the Cold War was not accompanied by \nan onrush of new threats, but by the surprise appearance of an \nold threat. On 2 August 1990, Iraq launched a surprise attack \nagainst its neighbour Kuwait. This was arguably an event that \nGCHQ had been awaiting for three decades. Iraq had long \nprofessed claims to areas of Kuwaiti territory; meanwhile Britain \nhad sought to deter an Iraqi attack because of its friendship \n466 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nwith the Kuwaiti royal family. Back in January 1965, shortly \nafter Joe Hooper took aver from Clive Loehnis as Director of \nGCHQ, one of his first tasks was to discuss the future of a small \nGCHQ team in Kuwait whose brief was to constantly sweep the \nairwaves for signs of an Iraqi attack. 'While the team was a \nreasonable insurance factor in providing timely warning of an \nexternal attack,' he explained to the JIC, 'it could do little or \nnothing to give Sigint warning of internal unrest or a coup: \nHooper was pressed for resources, and wondered whether the \nteam's task could be carried out by the bigger sigint stations on \nCyprus. However, GCHQ did not want to suffer the 'loss of \ntactical Sigint information on the Basra brigade', the key unit \nof the Iraqi Army. This could only be collected at short range, \nso it decided the team should stay in place.4 Sigint against Iraq \ndid not operate in isolation. There was also regular photographic \nintelligence from a Canberra photo reconnaissance aircraft flying \nalong the edge of the Iraqi frontier to detect an Iraqi military \nbuild-up. In an emergency, typically a warning from SIS or \nGCHQ, British diplomats in the Persian Gulf could order high\u00ad\nlevel photographic flights over the Basra area of southern Iraq, \npenetrating up to fifty-five miles inside the border, to confirm \nor disprove indications of a coming attack.5 \nNo less than twenty-five years later, the alert system worked. \nOn 27 July 1990, five days before Iraq's attack on Kuwait, the \nJIC gave a clear warning that aggression was likely.6 Although \nno one spotted the precise timing, warning signals continued \nto grow.7 On 29 July, Iraq's Soviet-built long-range radar units, \ncode-named 'Tall King', became very active, having been silent \nfor some months. There was now a considerable programme of \nsatellite monitoring of Iraq, mostly through imagery, which was \nexpected to provide twenty-four hours' notice of an attack. \nHowever, despite warnings of troops massing on the Kuwait \nborder, the prevailing thinking in the White House and Downing \nStreet was that this was a bluff. What had made anticipating \nIraq's intentions harder was the sophisticated training that the \nUnited States had itself offered to the country in the mid-1980s \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 467 \nduring the war between Iraq and Iran. This included lessons on \nsecure communications, encouraging the extensive use of land\u00ad\nlines with fibre-optic cables, together with many reserve commu\u00ad\nnication channels. Nevertheless, the intelligence community had \nwarned of a likely invasion, but political leaders simply \ndiscounted it. As with the Falklands, they had difficulty with \nthe concept that there were old-fashioned military dictators \naround who still liked going to war.8 Reassurances from Egypt's \nPresident Hosni Mubarak that, despite the military build-up, \nnothing would happen also misled the West.9 \nOperation 'Desert Storm', designed to retake Kuwait, was \nunleashed on 17 January 1991 with a wave of air attacks. Oddly, \nthis conflict resembled the vast tank battles that NATO had \nprepared to fight with the Soviets in central Europe during the \nCold War. The United States supplied by far the largest compo\u00ad\nnent of troops, and Britain the next. Ranged alongside them \nwere contributions from France, Australia and many Middle \nEastern states, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Once the Gulf \nWar began in earnest, British and American sigint experts \nbecame involved ill complex discussions about how much of \nthe Iraqi signals infrastructure should be left intact to permit \ncontinued monitoring, perhaps with the intention of locating \nSaddam Hussein. They also had to think about their own decep\u00ad\ntion operations, which were distributing false orders to Iraqi \nbattalions. British forces conducted a classic operational decep\u00ad\ntion, superintended by a unit code-named 'Rhino Force'. On \nseveral field exercises by Britain's First Armoured Division, \nmessages were transmitted on low power to avoid interception \nby Iraqi signals intelligence units. During the actual ground \nattack, on 23 January, recordings of these earlier transmissions \nwere played back at full power. They were then heard clearly \nby the Iraqis. By that time most of the British forces had moved \nabout 125 miles to the west to link up with the main US Seventh \nArmy Corps in their attack, yet the Iraqis thought they were \nheading in the opposite direction. The British tuned in to what \nremained of the Iraqi command network, and further signals \n468 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nintelligence showed that the Iraqis had bought this deception \nin its entirety. Meanwhile, a secret radio station based in Saudi \nArabia pretended to be 'Radio Kuwait', and broadcast the false \nnews that Kuwait City had already fallen to the allies, causing \nseveral Iraqi units to flee for fear of being cut off.1O \nOperation 'Desert Storm' illustrated the close relationship \nbetween special forces and sigint. The main task assigned to British \nspecial forces was hunting down Iraqi Scud missile launchers. The \nSBS was given responsibility for eastern Iraq, while the SAS was \nallocated the west. In addition to the Scuds, the SBS was given \na further important target: a major terminal for the fibre-optic \ncables that provided the backbone of Iraq's remarkably modern \nand secure communications network. This nexus was located \nabout thirty miles from Baghdad, alongside an oil pipeline. A team \nof thirty-six men, with four hundred pounds of explosive, was \ntaken to the site by two Chinook helicopters during the night of \n22 January.1I Their task was to disable a section of the commu\u00ad\nnications network which lay a few feet beneath the sand. \nThe flight time was at least two hours each way, leaving only \na limited period of darkness in which to complete the mission. \nMost of the party formed a defensive circle with machine guns \nand grenade launchers, while the remainder began searching \nfor their target. After much scurrying about with ground scan\u00ad\nners and cable locators a number of holes were dug, but infu\u00ad\nriatingly no cable was found. Dawn was fast approaching, and \nthe helicopter crews were becoming more and more anxious. \nEventually the commander chose the hole that seemed most \nlikely to be close to the cable, filled it with all their explosives \nand set a charge, hoping they were near enough. On their return \nto base they were told that they had indeed severed the cable. \nThe main task of the mission was to force the Iraq regime 'up \nonto the air', in other words to make it use wireless commu\u00ad\nnications that could then be intercepted, and there was indeed \nan increase in high-frequency radio traffic. However, not all the \nfibre-optic networks were destroyed, and thereafter the cables \nproved largely invulnerable to bombing.12 \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 469 \nForcing the Iraqis to rely more on high-frequency radio offered \nGCHQ several advantages. It is widely alleged that radio equip\u00ad\nment sold to Baghdad prior to the Gulf War was subtly adapted \nso that the British could monitor its transmissions more easily. \nThis is not to suggest that the British manufacturers, RacaL were \naware that their equipment had been altered in this way. RacaL \nwhich had long experience of making such equipment, were \nthe main suppliers of rack radios to GCHQ for its own moni\u00ad\ntoring operations. Several senior staff from GCHQ had become \ndirectors of Racal. The alleged decision to modify the radios was \ntaken perhaps as early as 1985, when Iraq spent \u00a342 million \non state-of-the-art Racal Jaguar V radios, equipped with \nfrequency-hopping to allow them to counter Iranian monitoring \nand jamming on the battlefield. Remarkably, Racal was building \na radio factory in Iraq when the Gulf War broke out in 1991. \nIn any case, exchanges between Iraqi commanders could be \nread by both GCHQ and NSAY \nIraqi communications discipline was very good, and sigint \nfailed to find the location of a single Scud missile during the \nGulf War. 14 The conflict revealed once more the familiar weak\u00ad\nnesses that existed in British intelligence support for major expe\u00ad\nditionary operations -something witnessed in the Falklands ten \nyears before. At each leveL British Army formations depended \nmostly on their own intelligence assets, and there was little \ninter-service cooperation. Information flowed from GCHQ and \nfrom the imagery centre at RAF Brampton in Cambridgeshire, \nbut mostly because officers at Divisional HQ in the Gulf had \n'mates' at the desk level in Cheltenham who they could tele\u00ad\nphone directly. The tactical exploitation of national intelligence \nassets was poor. However, this time the lessons were learned, \nand by 1996 Britain had created a Permanent Joint Headquarters \nat Northwood with an intelligence division specifically tasked \nwith solving many of these problems.15 \nIn contrast to the situation in previous conflicts, by 1991 \nGCHQ was no longer invisible to the British public. During the \napproach of the Gulf War a prankster had taken advantage of \n470 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nthis and posted hundreds of letters using forged GCHQ \nnotepaper, ordering people to report to Lichfield barracks in \nStaffordshire to commence two weeks of crash training prior to \nbeing flown out to the Gulf by an RAF Hercules transport plane. \nThe recipients, apparently chosen at random and mostly with \nno previous military service, endured not a little anxiety.16 Senior \nmanagers at GCHQ were forced to issue warnings telling the \npublic to ignore the hoax letters. \nOne of the big discoveries of the Gulf War of 1991 was the scale \nof Iraq's stocks of chemical weapons. The task of monitoring their \ndestruction after the end of hostilities was allocated to a mission \nof UN inspectors called the United Nations Special Commission, \nor UNSCOM. They picked their way through innumerable mili\u00ad\ntary sites and palaces, some of them with as many as five hundred \nseparate buildings, looking for weapons declared illegal under UN \nrulings. Soon a number of these observers, who in many cases \nwere British, Australian or American military personnel on loan, \nwere conducting short-range sigint using scanners, and delivering \nthe material to their national intelligence agencies and also to \nthe Israelis. This so-called Special Collection Element within \nUNSCOM was suggested by Scott Ritter, a former US Marine \nofficer who had been working with UNSCOM since 1995. It often \nrecorded Iraqi warnings to weapons facilities that the inspectors \nwere on their way, but given that the material took weeks to \nprocess, this was of little help to the inspectors on the ground. \nArguments soon developed. Israel's sigint agency, called Unit \n8200, was helpful and provided the inspectors with complete \ntranscripts, but the Americans only returned small amounts of \nredacted material to UNSCOM.17 \nNSA and GCHQ would use UNSCOM as short-range collec\u00ad\ntors up until 1996, but predictably they were paranoid about \nsharing any decrypted product which carried the ominous caveat \n'Special Compartmented Intelligence -Top Secret/Final Curtain'. \nAs a result, relations between the inspectors and NSA were \nincreasingly frosty. When Scott Ritter came to Britain in the \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 471 \nhope of developing closer relations between his Special \nCollection Element and GCHQ, his contact at GCHQ apologised \nand said that they could not assist him. He explained: 'Even if \nwe could handle the materiaL the special relationship between \nthe UK and the Americans prevents us from sharing the take \nwith an outside agency, such as UNSCOM, without the express \npermission of the Americans: and added apologetically, 'This \npermission isn't being given.' Later, another British official \nexplained the full picture to him. The GCHQ station on Cyprus \nhad identified strange burst transmissions coming from the UN \nheadquarters in Iraq. GCHQ concluded that there was a separ\u00ad\nate CIA communications intercept operation inside the building, \nput in place by its local agents. This was an automated 'black \nbox' operation that collected local Iraqi signals and then \ncompressed them to be sent as a short 'burst' signal to American \nU-2 aircraft which flew over Baghdad about once a day. In \nshort, GCHQ had concluded that America no longer had any \nneed of UNSCOM to collect sigint inside Iraq.ls \nOne of the important features of intelligence in the 1990s was \nthe improving relations between the UKUSA countries and Israel. \nA few years earlier, Bill Odom, the Director of NSA, had \ndenounced the head of Israel's intelligence agency Mossad, \nNahum Admoni, as 'a nasty slippery man' who had refused to \ncooperate with NSA and GCHQ on sigint programmes against \nthe Soviets. Admoni retired in 1989, and was replaced by Shabtai \nShavit, who was regarded as much more amenable.19 NSA, GCHQ \nand the Israelis now worked much more closely on Iraq, yet at \nthe same time they were at loggerheads elsewhere, most obvi\u00ad\nously in the former Yugoslavia, which by the summer of 1991 \nwas collapsing into a series of bitter civil wars. Many Western \nintelligence services suddenly found themselves seriously at odds \nwith each other in this complex conflict, with its bewildering \nfactions. The United States worked closely with Germany's BND \nto assist the Croats and Bosnian Muslims in an effort to create \na level playing field. Meanwhile, it regarded the British as too \n472 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nfriendly with the Bosnian Serb headquarters at Pale, where SIS \nundoubtedly enjoyed good sources of intelligence. Along with \nthe secret services of Greece and the Ukraine, Mossad was openly \npro-Serbian, and was concerned by the CIA's close cooperation \nwith Turkey and Iran in a covert operation to fly in arms and \njihadist fighters from the Middle East to bolster the Muslim cause, \nin clear contravention of the United Nations arms embargo. The \nformer Yugoslavia also offered some fascinating lessons in the \ntortuous politics of allied signals intelligence.2o \nBosnia was a place where relations between GCHQ and NSA \nwere tense. Intelligence sharing between the two allies on the \nBalkans was limited, and NSA was very reluctant to provide its \nBritish partner with any intelligence on the Muslim factions \nthat were favoured by Washington. Meanwhile, General Sir \nMichael Rose, a former head of the SAS and now the British \nCommander in Chief of the United Nations Protection Force, \nfound that his biggest problem was the insecure and elderly \ncommunications equipment that the British Army had endured \nfor years. The need for better radios had been one of the obvious \nlessons from the Falklands, but Britain's defence bureaucrats \nhad bungled hopelessly. Rose realised that his UN headquarters \nin Sarajevo were effectively under surveillance by the Americans. \nHe himself was regarded as a 'legitimate target' for sigint collec\u00ad\ntion by the USA, since he was officially serving as a UN mili\u00ad\ntary chief, rather than as a British commanderY \nNSA worked closely with the German BND to offer sigint \nsupport to the various Muslim elements, not least to Croatia, \nwhich had suffered badly at the hands of the Serbs in the fighting \nof 1991 and 1992. They focused on boosting the work of Admiral \nDavor Domazet, chief of Croatia's military intelligence during \nthe struggle against secessionist Serbian guerrillas in the east of \nthe country. This was especially visible during 1993, when \nCroatian forces pushed forward into the Medak Pocket, and \nagain in August 1995, when they conducted a lightning offen\u00ad\nsive known as 'Operation Storm'. This was supported by \nunmanned intelligence-gathering drones which allowed \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 473 \nCroatian artillery to locate the positions of rebel Serbs on the \nground. Reportedly, the drones were operated by the CIA from \na base at Zadar on the Adriatic coast. More importantly, NSA \nsupplied Croatian signal~ intelligence units with improved satel\u00ad\nlite dishes for electronic surveillance of telephone traffic.22 \nSigint was a major factor in the Croatian success. The Croatian \nequivalent of NSA, the National Central Electronic \nReconnaissance Agency (NSEI), was the most significant and \nsecretive part of the country's intelligence system. In 1995 it \nwas able to listen in on panicked phone calls to Slobodan \nMilosevic , the Serbian leader in Belgrade, pleading for help as \nSerb forces were pushed back during 'Operation Storm'. It was \nalso able to follow Milosevic in his efforts to put pressure on \nneighbouring Montenegro. NSEI successfully monitored other \nkey participants across all regions of the former Yugoslavia. \nThese included the British, who found themselves subject to \naggressive sigint collection by multIple elements. However, while \nNSEI was good on sigint, it was bad on its own communica\u00ad\ntions security. Accordingly, when the Croatians shared the sigint \nthey had collected en the British amongst themselves, this was \nin turn picked up by additional parties and shared again.23 \nMilos Stankovic, a British major from the Parachute Regiment \nwho was serving on General Rose's United Nations staff at \nSarajevo, explains this strange situation in a section of his \nmemoirs appropriately entitled 'The Mad Hatter's Tea Party'. It \nwas accepted by the long-serving British officers accompanying \nRose that their offices were under technical surveillance by the \nAmericans, and probably the Croatians and Bosnian Muslims \ntoo. However, the Bosnian Serb leaders in Pale, such as Radovan \nKaradzic and Ratko Mladic, also seemed to have advance warning \nof any British initiative. Stankovic patiently explained the situ\u00ad\nation to a new initiate on the British team: \n* . .. the Serbs were bugging the buggers ... if you'll excuse \nthe pun. Everyone was bugging each other. No secrets in \nthe Balkans. The only people not playing this game was \n474 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nthe UN. It's simple: Rose is discussing [NATO Commander \nin Chief, US General John] Galvin's programme in his office \nthe previous day, the Yanks or the Bosnians bug that conver\u00ad\nsation, and then the Serbs listen in to what the Bosnians \nare saying to each other. Before you know it that little \ntidbit had landed on MladiC's desk ... \n* NSA actually had a covert listening station in the American \nEmbassy in Sarajevo which was 'busy hoovering up every single \nlittle electronic bleep and fart'. The NSA team had arrived in \nYugoslavia under military cover as US Army officers, but 'could \nnot carry it off very well'.24 By November 1994, numerous inci\u00ad\ndents of uncanny preknowledge on the part of the Bosnian \nMuslims offered multiple confirmation of technical surveillance. \nGeneral Michael Rose was conscious of this, and sometimes \nused it for deception purposes. However, it made attempts to \nnegotiate difficult, since the Bosnian Muslims always had the \nupper hand over the Serbs because of their better technical \ncoverage.25 To cap it all, Britain could hear itself being listened \nto. Its own sigint operations were being conducted on the \nground, using 'Odette' and 'Vampire' intercept units.26 Sigint \nwas also collected by two Royal Navy frigates based in the \nAdriatic, and RAF Nimrod R1s flying out of NATO bases in \nItaly.27 \nBy early 1995 Rose had been succeeded as UN Commander \nin Bosnia by another senior British officer, General Rupert Smith. \nOne day shortly after his arrival, Smith made a number of urgent \ncalls to London on a supposedly secure scrambler phone, and \nthen hurried from his headquarters to the nearby American \nEmbassy for a meeting. While he spoke with senior Americans \non the top floor, his military aide wandered around the lower \nfloors of the Embassy. To his amazement, despite the fact that \nSmith was on the top floor, the aide could hear his commander's \nvoice coming from a room at the end of a corridor. This proved \nto house an interception centre, where staff were busy listening \nto one of the telephone conversations Smith had held with \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 475 \nLondon only an hour before. As a result of this confirmation \nthat a joint CIA-NSA listening operation was being directed \ntowards the UN headquarters, Smith was more careful with his \ncommunications thereafter, often using the encrypted radios of \nthe Special Air Service, which he believed to be more secure.28 \nPerhaps the most historic change for GCHQ in the early 1990s \nwas the loss of its listening station in Hong Kong, which, but \nfor a brief interruption during the Second World War, had been \nthere since the early days of GC&CS. This was triggered by the \nimpending transfer of Hong Kong to Chinese rule. Washington \nviewed Hong Kong as an irreplaceable watchtower on China. \nFor years British diplomats had complained that Britain was \ncollecting more intelligence about China than it could possibly \nneed, and had asked why this target was so important. The \nunderlying rationale was exchange with the Americans. Hong \nKong was the single most valuable British collection station to \nNSA, providing offset in an otherwise unbalanced Anglo\u00ad\nAmerican intelligence relationship.29 \nNotwithstanding the fact that NSA knew the British would \nhave to leave in 1997, it had poured huge investment into \nBritish sigint at Hong Kong. In 1982 the GCHQ station at Little \nSai Wan, which had depended on listeners with headphones, \nhad been closed down and replaced by a new operation at Chum \nHom Kok, on the south side of the island, which monitored \nsatellite activity.30 This new station was initially given the code \nname 'Demos-I'.3l The problem with the location was accom\u00ad\nmodating the massive dishes -there were eventually five -on \nwhat was a narrow shelf of rock overlooking the South China \nSea.32 Chinese agents took a close interest in the station, so \nthere were tight procedures whereby a 'cleared expatriate' super\u00ad\nvised the moving of classified waste to a vast 'Refudoc' incin\u00ad\nerator in the main building. The bum bags full of top-secret \nsigint material were huge, standing three feet high and weighing \nabout thirty pounds.33 \nDespite the problems of its precarious site, Demos-I had \n476 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \ncontinued to grow during the 1980s. A further programme code\u00ad\nnamed 'Demos-4' provided yet more enormous dishes to capture \ncivil traffic from China's growing network of communications \nsatellites, and also telemetry from missile tests. Perched on top \nof a cliff, this was an astonishing feat of civil construction, five \nyears in the making. Elaborate earthworks and retaining walls \nwere required to prevent the whole facility slipping into the sea. \nRoy Chiverton, one of the senior staff in GCHQ's F Division, was \nexasperated by the complexity of the project: 'The situation \nchanges so frequently ... 1 keep tearing up drafts: He added, 'I \nam not deterred -but my wastepaper basket gets fuller:34 The \nvast dish antennae, constructed to the latest NSA design, were \nsupplied by Lockheed from its Sunnyvale facility in California.35 \nMuch of the equipment was very delicate, and it was suscep\u00ad\ntible to damage in transit, prompting officials to refer scathingly \nto what they called 'crushed dish syndrome'.36 Nevertheless, \nwhen the Chum Hom Kok station was finished, John Adye, who \nbecame Director of GCHQ in 1989, wrote to the site engineers \npraising their efforts. Building had continued in bad monsoon \nweather, and he added that he had seen 'some horrific photo\u00ad\ngraphs of a mechanical excavator poised on the edge of a very \nsteep slope'. He conveyed GCHQ's sincere thanks to all who had \ncontributed to a project on which 'a great deal depended'.37 \nThe investment was repaid with excellent intercepts of Chinese \nmilitary traffic that revealed, for instance, Beijing's thinking \naround the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre in June \n1989.38 Yet even while this new station was being completed, \nthe British were reminding NSA that their time on Hong Kong \nwas running out. Odom had suggested that Britain should try \nto keep control of the Commander British Forces HQ building \nin Hong Kong even after handover, because it was by far the \nbest medium-wave sigint collection site in the territory. However, \ndespite concerted pressure from the Americans, the British were \n'unenthusiastic' about this idea.39 NSA and GCHQ had already \nbegun to ponder future alternative sites. Odom noted in his ever\u00ad\npresent daily logbook: 'Hong Kong -where to move our gear?'40 \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 477 \nAt midnight on 1 July 1997 the colony of Hong Kong was \nfinally returned to China, signalling the end of Britain's ninety\u00ad\nnine-year lease on the New Territories. All the intercept equip\u00ad\nment had already been moved to Geraldton, a DSD site in \nWestern Australia. It was hoped that the loss of interception \nfrom Hong Kong would be partly offset by a sophisticated moni\u00ad\nto ring operation against the new Chinese Embassy in Canberra. \nThe West had devoted enormous attention to state-of-the-art \nsurveillance of this new diplomatic complex, and the resulting \nintelligence 'take' was so great that there were often thirty tran\u00ad\nscribers in the Australian capital processing it, a miniature version \nof the team recruited to translate the Berlin tunnel material in \nthe 1950s. Secret collection from the Chinese Embassy included \nnot only sound, but even video footage. This opened a price\u00ad\nless window on Chinese communications, which had always \nbeen very hard to break. However, just like the Berlin tunnel, \nthe duration of this operation was short, and to the fury of \nGCHQ and its allies the operation was blown by the Australian \npress in 1995.41 \nHong Kong also illustrates the shift towards using sigint against \norganised crime after the end of the Cold War. During the last \ndays of the colony the Royal Navy was part of an Anti-Smuggling \nTask Force that was struggling to keep up with the extremely \nfast boats used by local criminals who were stealing luxury cars \non the streets of Hong Kong and shipping them to mainland \nChina. Once in China, the smugglers were paid for the cars in \nheroin, which they then brought back for sale in the colony. \nBoarding the vessels of the smugglers, which could achieve \nseventy miles per hour, was dangerous, and the crews were \noften armed with automatic weapons, so the Task Force decided \nto try sigint. Using two well-trained sigint operators with the \nlatest frequency scanners, it was able to tune in to the smug\u00ad\nglers' radios and locate the point of exchange. The Task Force \nswooped on the quiet dock where the smugglers were offloading \nforty-five pounds of heroin in return for a BMW 7 series that \nhad been stolen off the streets of Hong Kong only that day.42 \n478 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nAfter the handover of Hong Kong, China remained an impor\u00ad\ntant intelligence target. Some Western sigint agencies exploited \nthe growing volume of container shipping that thronged Chinese \nports and proceeded along China's major waterways for perhaps \na thousand miles inland by installing remote collection equip\u00ad\nment deep in the bowels of the vessels of friendly container \ncompanies, timed to begin recording once the ship came close \nto China. The more sophisticated versions beamed their 'take' \nup to overhead satellites for rapid exploitation.43 \nIn Europe, too, the iconic watchtowers were tumbling. One \nvery public manifestation of the end of the Cold War was the \nclosure of the vast Teufelsberg station overlooking Berlin, after \nthirty years of operation.44 Yet at GCHQ there was no rapid shift \nof resources away from Russia, merely a gentle drift of numbers \ntowards K Division, which handled non-Russian sigint.45 This \nwas understandable, since for the first time in decades Russia \nwas now a promising intelligence target. In the early 1990s the \nmarket was being flooded with would-be KGB defectors hoping \nfor a comfortable resettlement package in the West. Amid this \nembarrassment of riches, it was sometimes hard to know which \nageing KGB men should be taken onto SIS's dwindling payroll. \nBritain's ability to absorb defectors, rehabilitate them and offer \nthem a pension, as had been done with Oleg Gordievsky in the \n1980s, was very limited. Nevertheless, one defector was judged \nof sufficiently high value to make such an investment worth\u00ad\nwhile. This was Colonel Alexander Simakov, a missile specialist \nwho had worked in mission control for every ballistic missile \ntest the Russians had conducted between 1984 and 1990. In \n1991 he had introduced himself to a British Army sergeant \nrunning in the Moscow marathon, and through this chance \ncontact had been put in touch with SIS. Simakov was the human \nend of all the missile telemetry that GCHQ and NSA had been \nassiduously collecting from locations such as Thrkey and Cyprus \nfor almost half a century. 'The guy's a goldmine,' remarked the \nSIS rocket specialists. 'We've got to get him residency here.' \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 479 \nSimakov defected in 1992, and was soon providing a full \nrundown on Russia's new strategic command bunker. The oppor\u00ad\ntunity to marry up sigint with human agent material was elec\u00ad\ntrifying: SIS officers enthused, 'We've hit the jackpot.'46 \nWith the end of the Cold War, the world was positively \ncrawling with redundant intelligence officers of every hue, \noffering their services for a fee. In Russia, many former KGB \nofficers drifted off into private security work or organised crime \n-the two spheres often overlapped to an alarming degree. Other \nparts of the world saw intelligence officers setting up private \nmilitary companies that were active in Africa, and would become \nprominent in the Middle East after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. \nIn Britain too, the long years of the Cold War, together with \nan extended struggle against organisations like the IRA, meant \nthat many had been trained in the dark arts of telephone inter\u00ad\nception and bugging. Their services were now available for hire. \nBy the early 1990s this was having an impact on public life in \nBritain, largely through the growing use of freelance intercep\u00ad\ntion and other forms of privatised intelligence-gathering by \ntabloid journalists. One of the targets of this new privatised \nsigint activity was the royal family. \nIn the first weeks of 1990, Cyril Reenan, a retired bank \nmanager, parked outside Didcot railway station not far from his \nhouse in Abingdon, a quiet town in Oxfordshire. In his spare \ntime Reenan was an amateur eavesdropper who used a radio \nscanner to listen in to all types of radio transmissions, including \nmobile phones, for his private amusement. At his home he had \narranged an old 1960s-style reel-to-reel tape recorder next to \nhis scanner to capture anything interesting that he overheard. \nHe believed he had captured an extremely intimate conver\u00ad\nsation between Diana, Princess of Wales, and James Gilbey, a \nchildhood friend who owned a Lotus car dealership and was \nheir to the Gilbey's Gin fortune. He was now about to hand \nthe tape over to the Sun newspaper. \nThe tape was not published by the Sun until August 1992. \nGilbey initially insisted the story was false, but the paper took \n480 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nthe remarkable step of setting up a dedicated phone-line which \nallowed callers to hear the whole tape at a cost of 36 pence per \nminute. In fact this was not the whole tape, since even the Sun \nhad blushed at certain sections of the recording, and had edited \nsome passages out. Diana offered a lengthy description of her \ntreatment at the hands of the royal family, and detailed what \nshe considered to be the Queen's condescension and pity towards \nher. Gilbey referred to the Princess alternately as 'Darling' or \n'Squidgy'. The latter name, used fifty-three times during the \nconversation, was soon adopted by the press, which routinely \nreferred to the affair as 'Squidgygate' .47 \nThrough the early 1990s, interest in the tapes was sustained \nby the so-called 'War of the Waleses' during which the Prince \nand Princess of Wales battled for public sympathy. This included \nthe leaking of material to trusted journalists, and finally entire \ntelevision programmes. Each week the tabloids offered new reve\u00ad\nlations, including accounts of the Princess's depression and failed \nsuicide attempts. Increasing attention was given to Charles's \nlong-standing relationship with Camilla Parker-Bowles, which \nmany journalists hod known about, but which now entered the \npublic domain. The growing public interest prompted the Sunday \nTimes to ask a company of surveillance specialists called Audiotel \nInternational to analyse the Diana tape obtained by the Sun. \nThey quickly realised that this was not a conversation that could \nhave been recorded on a simple radio scanner in the manner \nrecounted by Cyril Reenan. \nFirst of all there were what Audiotel called 'data bursts', or \n'pips', which were indicators used for charging a call. This seem\u00ad\ningly innocuous fact was important, since these 'pips' are not \nbroadcast over the radio system that carries mobile telephone \ncalls, but are filtered out at the local exchange. This, and the fact \nthat two other amateur scanners had also recorded the conver\u00ad\nsation, suggested strongly that the tape had been recorded by \nprofessionals and then rebroadcast, whereupon it was picked \nup by Reenan. Within a few days the Sunday Times asked a \nsecond set of audio experts retained by Sony International to \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 481 \nexamine the tape. They agreed that this was not a conver\u00ad\nsation captured by a ~canner, partly because scanners usually \ncapture only one half of a conversation clearly. More impor\u00ad\ntantly, there was a 'hum' in the background, which they noted \nwas the usual effect of trying to record a telephone conver\u00ad\nsation via a direct physical tap on a landline. \nGiven that Gilbey was speaking from a mobile telephone, this \npointed strongly to the possibility that a professional telephone \ntap had been secretly attached to Diana's landline inside \nSandringham. The experts believed that the doctoring of the \ntape constituted a crude attempt to make a tap on a landline \nsound as if it was an intercepted mobile telephone call. A little \nlater there was further confirmation when Cellnet, the company \nthat supported Gilbey's mobile phone, revealed that the sensa\u00ad\ntional press stories had triggered an internal investigation, as \nthe company feared that its security had been breached. It too \nconcluded that this was a professional tap on a landline. Tellingly, \nall the amateur listeners who intercepted the call on their scan\u00ad\nners, heard it several days after the real call was actually made. \nThis information was dynamite, since many believed it pointed \nto the involvement of the intelligence and security services. \nHowever, the Home Secretary, Kenneth Clarke, denounced the \nidea as 'extremely silly', since tapping was rigidly controlled, \nand insisted that he was 'absolutely certain' that this had nothing \nto do with MIS, SIS or GCHQ. Instead, he blamed the news\u00ad\npapers, which he suspected of freelance interception. The annual \nreport of the Interception Commissioner, Lord Bingham of \nCornhill, also implicitly cleared the agencies. However, the \nChairman of the Broadcasting Standards Authority, Lord Rees\u00ad\nMogg, expressed a different view. He wondered whether the \ntapes were the result of a legitimate monitoring operation that \nwas part of the protection of the royal family, adding that once \nthe sensational recording had been made, it was almost inevitable \nthat it would be leaked. At first glance this seemed an absurd \nsuggestion, but few members of the public were aware of the \nsecurity services' intense anxiety about the threat from the IRA. \n482 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nElaborate measures had been taken to protect prominent people, \nincluding senior officials, after the assassination of the \nConservative MP Ian Gow by the IRA in July 1990, including \nthe setting up of a new central unit focused on personal secur\u00ad\nity. Fantastically complex monitoring equipment and alarms had \nbeen installed in the homes of VIPs by a veritable army of tech\u00ad\nnicians, some of whom were from the police and security serv\u00ad\nices and some of whom were contract workers. The same was \ntrue of the royal palaces, and this surge of technical protection \nhad provided endless opportunities for freelance activity.48 \nThe Queen was particularly disturbed by the 'Squidgygate' \naffair, because she immediately recognised what it meant for \nthe security of all royal communications. Accordingly, in January \n1993 she requested that the authorities carry out an internal \ninvestigation to find the culprits. At this point there was a flurry \nof meetings and correspondence involving the heads of both \nGCHQ and MI5. However, Kenneth Clarke was highly reluc\u00ad\ntant to initiate an inquiry, for fear of what might be uncovered, \nand was anxious that its findings would themselves leak, trig\u00ad\ngering another round of scurrilous stories.49 The person most \naffected by the 'Squidgygate' affair was Diana herself, who \nbecame increasingly obsessed with the threat of audio surveil\u00ad\nlance. This extended beyond the telephone, and there was \nconstant fear of bugs all over her apartments. In 1993 she \narranged for a team of communications security experts recom\u00ad\nmended to her by the Duchess of York to sweep her rooms at \nKensington Palace for bugs. They arrived disguised as carpet\u00ad\nfitters and searched for hidden microphones, but were denied \naccess to the main telephone exchange.5o By this point, tapes \nof conversations between Prince Charles and Camilla Parker\u00ad\nBowles had also surfaced, and the Cabinet Secretary Robin \nButler suggested having all the royal premises checked for \nevidence of interference with landlines.51 \nSince her tragic death on 31 August 1997, Princess Diana's \nfears of more widespread monitoring have partly been \nconfirmed. A news agency submitted a Freedom of Information \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 483 \nAct request to NSA for all its documents on Diana. Although \nNSA took the standard approach of sigint agencies, refusing to \ndeclassify so much as a page, it did admit that the US govern\u00ad\nment had a dossier of over 1,056 pages on the Princess. This \nincluded thirty-nine NSA documents, some of which were tran\u00ad\nscripts of telephone calls. Most of these would have been \ncollected as the result of her work overseas for various chari\u00ad\nties, including against landmines in Africa, which would have \nresulted in her being flagged up in channels which NSA routinely \nmonitors. The American journalist Gerald Posner was later \nallowed to hear extracts from NSA recordings of an intercepted \nphone call made by Diana to a friend in the Brazilian Embassy \nin Washington. 52 \nMore than a decade later, the matter was still a live public \nissue. In January 2008 Diana's former bodyguard, ex-policeman \nKen Wharfe, told the formal inquiry into her death that he \nbelieved the tapes had been deliberately broadcast by GCHQ in \nthe sure knowledge that radio hams would pick them up. \nHowever, he conceded that he had absolutely no evidence of \nGCHQ involvement. Later, John Adye, Director of GCHQ \nbetween 1989 and 1996, testified that there had been no mcmi\u00ad\ntoring of Diana by GCHQ, and certainly no warrant. He added \nthat audit trails at GCHQ were sufficiently good to identify unau\u00ad\nthorised monitoring. Adye was of the opinion that the recording \nof the telephone conversations was possibly a criminal activity \n-in other words, freelance bugging by an illegal agent. However, \nthis raises the awkward issue of how such individuals gained \nphysical access to some of the most sensitive areas of the royal \npalaces. The most likely explanation remains a rogue individual \nworking in a security capacity who enjoyed legitimate access to \nSandringham.53 \nBy the early 1990s there was a general shift towards the tighter \nregulation of intelligence. A key driving force here was the \nEuropean Convention on Human Rights. The Swedish security \nservice had recently been criticised by the European Court, \n484 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nbecause the agency had no legal existence and little oversight. \nThis triggered a headlong rush towards regulation right across \nEurope. More importantly, it generated cultural change. During \nthe Cold War the agencies had thought of themselves as 'secret \nservices' which could get away with their operations because \nnobody saw them. A symptom of this was GCHQ's improbable \nattempt to pretend that its vast installations and worldwide activ\u00ad\nities did not exist. Now, however, they were obliged to conceive \nof themselves as intelligence services with a legal identity. They \nhad less to fear from exposure, since all they had to do was \nshow that their activities were proportionate. Civil rights \ncampaigners found this a continual source of disappointment. \nHaving presumed that more regulation would mean more restric\u00ad\ntions on the secret state, they soon discovered that this was \npermissive legislation. Being 'legit' often meant that the agen\u00ad\ncies could carry out even more operations.54 \nAs a result, GCHQ was given a firm place on the statute books \nthrough the Intelligence Services Act of 1994, which stated \nclearly what the organisation did and greatly strengthened its \nlegal authority. A new oversight body also appeared called the \nIntelligence and Security Committee, composed of parliamen\u00ad\ntarians. Although this looked like a Parliamentary Select \nCommittee, it was in fact responsible to the Prime Minister, and \nlacked many of the powers normally associated with select \ncommittees. It reported to Downing Street and its powers were \nrelatively weak. Meanwhile, the real Parliamentary Select \nCommittees with a legitimate interest in intelligence, such as \nDefence and Foreign Affairs, were finding that government now \ntended to resist their efforts to probe secret matters. Instead, \nthey were told that intelligence was now the province of the \nIntelligence and Security Committee. Some have argued that \nJohn Major's experiment with openness was really about reaf\u00ad\nfirming secrecy. 55 \nSurprisingly, when the Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of \nClashfern, introduced the Intelligence Services Act in the House \nof Lords in December 1993, he actually felt that he had to make \nFROM COLD WAR TO HOT PEACE 485 \na case for the continued existence of the British intelligence and \nsecurity services. He argued that superpower rivalry during the \nCold War had offered 'its own grim version of stability', and \nthat while the collapse of Communism had reduced one cata\u00ad\nclysmic threat, it had also brought many new dangers. He spoke \nof a 'rising tide of nationalism and fanaticism, untried alliances, \nuntested groupings, new rivalries and new ambitions'. Rather \nphilosophically, he added: 'Greed, envy and corruption ... are \nas prevalent as ever.' Few were inclined to argue. In the ensuing \ndebate, former Cabinet Secretaries and former Prime Ministers \nheld forth, reflecting decades of experience as both managers \nand customers of the British intelligence community. Jim \nCallaghan argued that the intelligence services had grown large \nand powerful during the Cold War, and 'cost a great deal of \nmoney'. He urged that the most urgent task facing the new \nIntelligence and Security Committee was to review the future \nof GCHQ, which he described as 'a full blown bureaucracy', and \nadded that the new oversight bodies should 'investigate whether \nall the functions that GCHQ carries out today are still neces\u00ad\nsary'. He was not the only one asking this question. With the \nCold War over, some were now daring to ask what the future \npurpose of GCHQ might be.56 \n24 \nThe New Age of Ubiquitous Computing \nMobile cell phones increased from sixteen million to 741 million \n... Internet users went from about four million to 361 million. \nGeneral Michael Hayden, Director of NSA, \ncommenting on the 1990s1 \nIn the autumn of 1994, elite counter-drugs forces were searching \na compound in an affluent neighbourhood of the Colombian \ncity of Cali, home to some of the world's major cocaine cartels. \nThis time, instead of finding drugs, they uncovered a large \ncomputer centre, with six technicians slaving over an IBM AS400 \nmainframe around the clock. The presumption was that this \nhad something to do with major underworld financial transac\u00ad\ntions, so the computer was dismantled and taken to the United \nStates for analysis. In fact, the drug cartel had loaded all the \noffice and home telephone numbers of US diplomats and \ncounter-narcotics agents based in Colombia. They had then \nadded the entire regional telephone log containing the call \nhistory of the last two years, purchased illegally from the \ncommercial telephone company in Cali. This was being system\u00ad\natically analysed, using 'data-mining' software of the kind now \ncommonly used by intelligence agencies, to identify all the \npeople who had been calling the counter-narcotics officers on \na regular basis. The drug barons were engaged in sophisticated \nsigint to uncover informants in their ranks. Chillingly, a dozen \nhad already been assassinated, and this was the machine that \nhad uncovered them.2 \nAt about the same time, a team from GCHQ were assisting \nwith an investigation into blackouts of the national power grid \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 487 \nthat had struck Auckland in New Zealand. They proved to be \nthe result of electronic attacks on the country's electricity distri\u00ad\nbution network, launched over the internet. Australia's signals \nintelligence agency, the DSD, confirmed that intermittent black\u00ad\nouts across Queensland were the result of attacks from the same \nsource. The culprits were a group of hackers called the 'Anti\u00ad\nChrist Doom Squad' who were able to move effortlessly across \nthe computer systems of many countries using 'spoofed' user \nnames and stolen passwords to hide who they were. Once they \ngained access to the computers controlling New Zealand's power \nsupply, they focused on the distribution systems, picking a point \nwhere all five main power lines converged before coming into \nAuckland. By changing the temperature within the sensitive \ncables they quickly put them out of action. Remarkably, the \nwhole attack was run from a laptop in a drug cafe in the back \nstreets of Amsterdam. The offenders had then snaked a pathway \nthrough host computers in a dozen different countries, and \nGCHQ thought it was unlikely that it could ever bring a pros\u00ad\necution against them.3 \nIn 1995 GCHQ also found itself investigating cyber attacks \non banks in the City of London. Working with the Department \nof Trade and Industry and the Bank of England, it began to \nprobe crimes which the banks were extremely anxious to hide. \nOutwardly, they claimed to be secure, but in fact they had paid \nout millions of pounds to blackmailers who had gained entry \nto their systems and threatened to wipe their computer data\u00ad\nbases. GCHQ was hampered by limited cooperation from the \nbanks, which were reluctant to admit the extent to which they \nhad been damaged, for fear of undermining the confidence of \ninvestors. Nevertheless, GCHQ was able to identify forty-six \nattacks that had taken place over a period of two years, including \nattacks on three British banks and one American investment \nhouse. One of the questions GCHQ was asking was how the \nblackmailers had gained access to 'hacking' technologies that \nhad been developed by military scientists.4 \nTaken together, these computer attacks represented an \n488 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nalarming revolution. The identity of GCHQ had supposedly been \n'modernised' through the Intelligence Services Act of the \nprevious year. But the language of this legislation was archaic, \nemploying time-worn phrases such as 'wireless telegraphy'. \nMoreover, the intelligence agencies were struggling to embrace \nthe new age of personal computing and the internet.5 Of course, \nGCHQ and NSA had been intimately involved in the develop\u00ad\nment of cutting-edge computing, but the sigint agencies tended \nto think big. The great prize had always been access to high\u00ad\ngrade Soviet cyphers, and for this they needed massive super\u00ad\ncomputers. The code-breakers had been much less interested in \nthe development of personal computing and the internet. In \nthe 1980s, email had been an eccentric form of communication \nused mostly by bearded scientists in universities who wanted \nto chat about quarks and quasars. However, by the 1990s email \nwas rapidly becoming ubiquitous, and global commerce was \nincreasingly dependent on a 'wired world' provided by the \ninternet. This in turn led to growing anxiety about the safety \nof 'critical national infrastructure', the ever-growing electronic \nnetworks which underpinned not only banking, but also the \nmaintenance of many essential public services. \nFor GCHQ this was a paradigm shift. Alongside its traditional \ncode-breaking role, Cheltenham was increasingly under pres\u00ad\nsure to defend the whole underlying electronic system upon \nwhich banking, commerce and indeed all the public services \nthat supported national life now depended. GCHQ did not like \nthis, since it resurrected the familiar dilemma of 'offence versus \ndefence' in the realm of code-breaking, but in a much more \nunmanageable form. The dependence of banks and businesses \nupon ubiquitous networked computers led to a growing demand \nfor widely available computer security and confidential \nmessaging. Yet the very thing that GCHQ and NSA had been \nbattling against for years was the possibility of widely available \ncyphers and secure communications, since this would under\u00ad\nmine the whole business of sigint. Indeed, government was now \nasking them to advise large swathes of the private sector on the \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 489 \nhitherto dark secrets of how to maintain computer security. \nEven as they did so, they were privately agonising over how to \nstop the spread of the very same technology. \nIn the past, NSA and GCHQ had dealt with the demand for \nencryption from banks and businesses by forcing IBM, the \ncomputer industry leader, to weaken its Data Encryption \nStandard or 'DES', a cypher which protected communications \nbetween computers. The idea was that DES should be strong \nenough to prevent rival commercial companies or hackers from \nbreaking it, but weak enough to allow NSA and GCHQ to read \nit if they needed to.6 In June 1985 British, French, German and \nAmerican code-breakers had come together for a secret quadri\u00ad\npartite meeting in London about this problem, chaired by GCHQ. \nThey agreed that the Japanese computer industry would be a \nproblem 'for the foreseeable future', since it was not party to \nthis collective agreement. GCHQ arranged a division of labour, \nwith each sigint agency tracking the work of particular compa\u00ad\nnies: the British would watch Nokia in Finland, the French were \nto track the French arms company Thompson-CSF, and the \nAmericans followed Japanese activities. They all agreed that \nthey needed a long-term programme to 'destabilise' DES and \nany successors. As they suspected, by the 1990s DES was looking \nweak, and demands for stronger encryption by banks and busi\u00ad\nnesses were emerging everywhere.7 \nIn fact, the nemesis of the code-breaking agencies was not \nlarge corporations, but a group of maverick scientists. They explic\u00ad\nitly set themselves the task of recovering truly private commu\u00ad\nnication for the ordinary citizen after decades of government \nsurveillance. For them the Holy Grail was something they called \n'Public Key Cryptography'. The growing popularity of desktop \ncomputers in the 1990s, and their growing processor power, had \nopened up the possibility of ordinary people creating their own \ncodes of mind-boggling complexity. The problem that confronted \nthese mavericks was key distribution. It was no good being able \nto send a message secretly halfway around the world if the recip\u00ad\nient could not read it. To do this the recipient needed the key \n490 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nto unlock the code, and without the paraphernalia of a govern\u00ad\nment courier system, distributing the key safely and without \ninterception was a problem. However, the mavericks now made \na breakthrough. The most common analogy used to explain it \nis a series of padlocks. The sender, who we will call 'Alice', \nsecures her message to her friend 'Bob' with a cypher that works \nlike a padlock to which Bob does not have the key. When Bob \nreceives it, instead of trying to open it, he adds a second padlock \nthat depends on a cypher of his own devising, and sends it back \nto Alice. Alice then removes only her original padlock and sends \nit back to Bob, by which time it is only secured by Bob's padlock. \nBob can now open the box and read the message. They have \ncommunicated securely, yet there has been no key distribution.8 \nThis was a revolutionary breakthrough. The arrival of Public \nKey Cryptography triggered a veritable war between civilliber\u00ad\ntarians and the code-breaking agencies. For the mavericks, the \npossibility of email secrecy and anonymous web activity offered \nthe prize of a return to the golden age of privacy for the citizen. \nFor the sigint agencies, the military and the police this conjured \nup a world in which criminals, drug dealers and terrorists would \nbe able to avoid the interception of their communications and \nencrypt what was on their computers. The double irony was \nthat the global telecommunications revolution that had helped \nto bring all this about was also placing the sigint agencies under \ngrowing pressure from their own governments to assist with \nsecure e-commerce. Some time after his retirement, Sir Brian \nTovey, a former Director of GCHQ, explained the dilemma: \n* The question is: how in the world does one reconcile these \ntwo? How does one on the one hand assure industry that \nits communications are confidential and reliable, and how \non the other hand is Government under these very care\u00ad\nfully defined circumstances to continue to derive impor\u00ad\ntant information, be it about drug running, terrorism et \ncetera, from the interception of communications ... ? \n* \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 491 \nEither way, the tide of technology and economic activity, one \nmight even say the tide of globalisation, was moving in favour \nof ever greater security and against the sigint agencies. Taken \ntogether with the huge increase in the use of fibre-optic cables \nto carry telecom traffic, which was hard to tap into, this spelt \ndisaster for GCHQ.9 \nJust like fibre-optics, Public Key Cryptography appears to \nhave been discovered first by the British. Arguably the most \nimportant development in secure communications for several \ncenturies, it was partly invented by James Ellis at GCHQ in the \n1970s. However, Ellis's achievement was so far ahead of its time \nthat neither GCHQ nor NSA could initially see any application \nfor it, since the internet did not then exist. Sean Wyllie, one of \nGCHQ's top mathematicians, had raised the issue of Ellis's inven\u00ad\ntion during a visit to Washington and asked if it had any uses, \nbut it did not seem significant at the time.lo There was some \ntalk of using it to distribute the 'go-codes' for nuclear weapons, \nbut that was it. In the 1980s Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, \ntwo American computer scientists, discovered Public Key \nCryptography quite independently at a time when the devel\u00ad\nopment of desktop computers and the internet rendered it a \nbreakthrough development. They immediately recognised its \nimportance, and took it much further, developing ideas such as \ndigital signatures. II The US government responded by threat\u00ad\nening to prosecute them. Martin Hellman recalls: 'Some of my \nfriends who had worked in the intelligence community even \ntold me that my life could be in danger.'12 \nIn 1993 these matters were brought to a head by a soft\u00ad\nware engineer living in Boulder, Colorado, called Phil \nZimmermann. He developed a code-making programme for \ndesktop personal computers called 'PGP', which stood for \n'Pretty Good Privacy', and then gave it away on the internet \nfor free. Zimmermann had developed a quick and easy-to-use \nversion of Public Key Cryptography that retained much of its \nstrength, but greatly simplified its use. Now even the most \nnon-technical computer user enjoyed access to strong cyphers \n492 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nand secure email communications. The American government \nwas horrified, declaring that Zimmermann had effectively \n'exported munitions', and actually began a public prosecu\u00ad\ntion, hoping to put him in jail. After three years, the case -\nwhich became a cause dlebre -collapsed. Zimmermann asserted \ntriumphantly: 'This technology belongs to everybody.'13 \nGCHQ had debated the possibility of announcing its own early \ndiscovery of Public Key Cryptography as early as 1984. However, \neven while it pondered this, the controversy over Peter Wright's \nSpycatcher memoirs erupted, inflaming Margaret Thatcher'S noto\u00ad\nrious obsession with secrecy. GCHQ's senior management, who \nwere also embattled over the trade union issue, took fright and \ndecided to keep quiet. It was more than a decade before GCHQ \nsummoned up the courage to make a public avowal of its \nremarkable achievements. Cabinet Office approval for a public \nannouncement was finally granted in late December 1997. \nTragically, James Ellis, a true hero of sigint who certainly ranks \nalongside the greats such as Alan Turing, had died just a month \nearlier, on 25 November 1997. He never received proper recog\u00ad\nnition within his lifetime.14 \nThroughout the 1990s, both NSA and GCHQ doggedly fought \nPublic Key Cryptography. The Clinton administration came up \nwith the idea of the so-called 'Clipper Chip', a small device in \nevery computer that could be directly accessed by government \nto bypass any encryption used by the owner. However, it was \nsoon shown that this device was easily disabled. Later, NSA \nsuggested that American computer manufacturers should be \npermitted to export computers with strong encryption if a spare \nset of decoding keys was accessible to the government through \na trusted third party. The proposals, known as 'Key Recovery' \nor 'Key Escrow', were bitterly criticised by privacy advocates. \nIn fact, this scheme was soon rendered unworkable by the export \nof strong computer encryption from other countries like \nSwitzerland, France, Germany and Belgium. This was a rerun \nof the European cypher machine problem encountered in the \n1960s. The difficulties only increased when mobile phones \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 493 \nappear~d that also boasted strong encryption, which were \nquickly purchased by the Chinese government. In the 1990s \nthe communications revolution continually favoured the code\u00ad\nmakers, and pushed the code-breakers firmly into second place.15 \nKeeping up with the internet revolution was proving expen\u00ad\nsive for the code-breakers. Yet just as GCHQ was faced with \nthese major challenges, its budget was severely cut. In the \nsummer of 1993 the British government began to call for defence \ncuts following the end of the Cold War. The Soviet Union had \nvisibly disintegrated, and the huge arsenals maintained by the \nWest for half a century no longer seemed necessary. When intel\u00ad\nligence chiefs tried to justify their budgets, there was no shortage \nof security problems in the world, but most looked quite small \nin scale. They included narcotics, money laundering, people \ntrafficking, terrorism, nuclear proliferation and the illegal light \nweapons trade. There was now more emphasis on economic \nintelligence. GCHQ was also giving more attention to 'economic \nwell-being'. Robin Robison, who worked in the Cabinet Office, \ndeclared in 1992 that he had seen 'sack loads' of economic \nmaterial making its way from GCHQ to the JIC.16 However, this \ndid not keep the economisers at bay. In late 1993 Sir Michael \nQuinlan, former Permanent Under-Secretary at the Ministry of \nDefence, was asked to carry out a 'Review of Intelligence \nRequirements and Resources'. This was completed in early 1994, \nand suggested only some gentle retailoring,17 Quinlan was a \ngreat friend of the intelligence services, yet even the modest \ncut of 3 per cent that he imposed on GCHQ was painful. Cold \nWar icons were wound up, including the long-serving 13 Signals \nRegiment which had listened to the Soviets along the Inner \nGerman Border for four decades. IS \nGCHQ now became entangled with the fate of a single indi\u00ad\nvidual. This was a rising star in the Conservative Party called \nJonathan Aitken. Having previously been a Minister for Defence, \nin 1994 he was appointed Chief Secretary to the Treasury, \nperhaps the most coveted post amongst younger Ministers and \n494 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \ncarrying Cabinet rank. Britain was in the middle of another \nexpenditure crisis, and Aitken's main task was to look for savings. \nOne of the effects of the end of the Cold War had been to allow \nthe Treasury to strip away a little of the mystery of secret ser\u00ad\nvices funding. For decades this had been grouped together as \nthe 'Secret Vote' and decided upon by the Prime Minister. In \n1994 the Treasury managed to make some inroads here, \nrequiring each agency chief to face bilateral discussions with \nthe Chief Secretary like ordinary mortals. As a result, much \nmore of Britain's carefully hidden intelligence spending became \nvisible. At this point formal British intelligence spending was \nabout \u00a31.1 billion per year, of which GCHQ claimed the lion's \nshare as ever, at \u00a3850 million. MI5 and SIS received the crumbs \nfrom under the table, at \u00a3125 million each.19 \nMI5 and SIS performed faultlessly in their meetings with \nAitken. David Spedding, the new chief of SIS, was a Middle \nEast expert and was at home in the post-Cold War environ\u00ad\nment. He explained how his networks of agents were a long\u00ad\nterm business, and could not be rebuilt quickly in a crisis if they \nwere cut back. Stella Rimington, Director General of MI5, \ntogether with her deputy, Stephen Lander, made a convincing \ncase for protection of its budget focused on the IRA. They argued \nthat while the Republicans were engaged in talks, they were \nalso secretly re-arming, so MI5 too escaped lightly. Aitken \nconfessed that he was 'actually convinced by some of the argu\u00ad\nments against cuts put forward by the spooks'. \nBy contrast, John Adye, leading the GCHQ team, performed \nbadly. Initially GCHQ produced 'bewildering countermeasures' \nby moving into the stratosphere of 'technical incomprehensi\u00ad\nbility'. As Aitken studied the agency more closely, burning the \nministerial midnight oil, he became convinced that there was \nsomething wrong. GCHQ, he concluded, was 'suffering from \nout-of-date methods of management and out-of date methods \nfor assessing priorities'. There was undoubtedly great technical \nwizardry. GCHQ was monitoring communications between \nRussian tank commanders in Chechnya -but what, asked \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 495 \nAitken, was the real value of this to British national inter\u00ad\nests?20 \nAitken sensed weakness. He pressed for a deep probe of GCHQ \nled jointly by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd and himself for \nthe Treasury. The real work was to be led by an outsider -Roger \nHum, the successful chairman of Smiths Industries, which made \ntechnical instruments.21 Hum's review team was formidable. It \nincluded Alice Perkins (a.k.a. Mrs Jack Straw), one of the most \neffective Treasury officials, and David Omand, 'a fearlessly \noutspoken Deputy Secretary at the MoD' .22 The schedule was \ntight. Commissioned on 12 December 1994, the team reported \nback to Ministers on 25 March 1995.23 GCHQ suffered a body \nblow. Hum took almost \u00a3200 million per annum off \nCheltenham's budget in one bite, somewhere close to a quarter \nof its spending. This left managers in deep shock. No British \nintelligence agency had suffered such deep retrenchment since \nthe end of the Second World War.24 These cuts heralded 'massive \nand dramatic change', qnd staff understandably had 'fears for \nthe future'. The vast Cold War 'silos' were broken up, resulting \nin the death of the mighty J Division, which handled sigint on \nRussia, and K Division, which handled the rest of the world. \nEven greater changes lay in store for the communications secur\u00ad\nity wing. Hum suggested that this should go over to charging \nits Whitehall customers on a cost-recovery basis.25 \nIf this was not enough, on 23 November 1995 it was \nannounced that the GCHQ Director, John Adye, would be \nreplaced by someone from outside the agency. This was David \nOmand, a senior official who had been part of the Hum Review \nteam. Many at GCHQ greeted this news with 'consternation \nand disappointment', since it seemed to signal that internal \ncandidates were not good enough. Some pondered aloud \nwhether Omand was yet another 'axe man' sent to further \ndownsize GCHQ.26 In fact it was inaccurate to say that Omand \nwas an 'outsider', since he had joined GCHQ straight from Corpus \nChristi College, Cambridge, in the 1970s. However, an obvious \nhigh-flyer, he had soon moved on to the Ministry of Defence. \n496 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nOmand's reputation for tough management and intellectual \nrigour caused visible panic at GCHQ.27 Wild rumours abounded \nthat the target figure for further job losses was at least three \nthousand, leaving a staff of perhaps just over two thousand at \nGCHQ by the end of the century.28 In reality, Omand was GCHQ's \nsaviour, rapidly reordering it for the post-Cold War world and \nputting in place imaginative new plans that central government \nwould fund. Meanwhile, the planned cuts were far more modest \nthan the doom-mongers had suggested. GCHQ stood at 5,900 \nstaff in April 1995, and managers envisaged a move to 5,300 \nover two years.2~ \nOmand performed open-heart surgery on GCHQ. He realised \nthat both rapidly shifting targets and the increasing pace of tech\u00ad\nnological evolution would mean abandoning the old structures. \nThe central concept was now something called 'Sinews', or 'Sigint \nNEW Systems', which gained massive momentum by 2000. The \naim of Sinews was to provide maximum flexibility of operations \nwhile avoiding wasteful overlap. In practice it resulted in the \ncreation of fourteen domains, each with a defined area of work. \nThe key to success was a small team of programme managers \nwho could move people rapidly from task to task, and a lot of \ntime was now spent balancing competing intelligence require\u00ad\nments. The whole purpose was to come to grips with the messy \npost-Cold War environment, with its myriad targets and changing \npriorities. One of the most important drivers of Sinews was a \nrecognition that the culture of GCHQ had to change from a \nhighly secretive 'need to know' towards 'need to share'.3o \nWhen David Omand took over on 1 July 1996, the most \nstriking aspect of GCHQ was its physical dilapidation. His own \noffice was a drab 1950s affair in C Block on the Oakley site. \nEven as GCHQ's management sought to anticipate the chal\u00ad\nlenges of the twenty-first century, their own windows looked \nout on a heritage theme park covered with 1940s prefabs. The \ncontrast was made all the sharper by the fact that SIS had just \nmoved into distinctive new London offices at Vauxhall Cross, \nby the side of the Thames, designed by the architect Terry Farrell, \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 497 \nthat could easily have been the work of the visionary televi\u00ad\nsion producer Gerry Anderson, creator of the 1960s puppet \nseries Thunderbirds. More importantly, one of the obstacles to \nimproving GCHQ was the fact that it was spread across innu\u00ad\nmerable small buildings on two sites, at Oakley and Benhalpl \nAccordingly, in September 1996 Omand began to consider a \nPrivate Finance Initiative to provide new accommodation. He \nalso improved the agency's profile with a new high-level GCHQ \npost in Whitehall and new London facilities in Albany Court, \nacross the road from its existing offices in Palmer Street.32 \nThe future shape of GCHQ was round -or to be more precise, \ndoughnut-shaped. Under Omand's new plan, by 2003 all of \nGCHQ's activities were to be brought together on the Benhall \nsite, in a vast new circular building with an open centre. The \noptimistic idea of post-Cold War peace was still in the air, and \nit was thought that while the building would take all of GCHQ's \nstaff, by the time it was completed lower numbers might even \nallow them to rent out some of the space.33 GCHQ would actu\u00ad\nally lease rather than buy its new quarters. When construction \nbegan in the late 1990s it was the largest building ever initi\u00ad\nated by the British government, and indeed the largest construc\u00ad\ntion project then in progress in Europe. The plan included an \nunderground road to service the main building, and massive \nbasement computer halls. Above ground, it required sixteen \nmiles of carpet and provided more than a million square feet \nof office space. There was great excitement about 'the Doughnut', \nbut also some trepidation. The new MI5 and SIS headquarters \nhad each cost more than three times their original estimated \nprice, largely due to computer problems, and by 1999 the \nprojected figures for the GCHQ building were already being \nlooked on with some scepticism.34 \nIn Britain, the advent of a new Labour government in 1997 \nbrought further change. At the start of the 1990s a young Tony \nBlair -then Shadow Employment Secretary -told an enthu\u00ad\nsiastic GCHQ trade union rally that the first act of a Labour \ngovernment would be to restore union rights to Cheltenham.35 \n498 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nThe union issue had not been dormant. By the 1990s the GCHQ \nTrade Union Campaign was a small but hardened machine, \nworking remorselessly to stay in touch with Blair, continually \nthanking him for speaking about GCHQ, congratulating him \non the attainment of each Shadow Cabinet post and keeping \nhim up to date with the campaign. Blair always responded \nwarmly and enthusiastically.36 Gordon Brown was also ener\u00ad\ngetic and sincere in his offers of assistance.37 Other key members \nof Blair's team, including Peter Mandelson and Tessa Jowell, \nhad continually praised what they called a brave and admirable \nactivity. Now Labour was back in power, the unions were \ncoming back to Cheltenham, with cloth caps, brass bands and \nbanners flying, all somewhat out of step with David Omand's \nnew mood of modernisation.38 \nIn the two years before the election, Tony Blair regularly \nrepeated his pledge to restore full trade union rights at \nCheltenham. During the period June to September 1995 he \nrepeated the undertaking on no fewer than four separate occa\u00ad\nsions.39 Yet trust between the GCHQ trade unions and the Labour \nMinisters who had backed them unstintingly for thirteen years \nwas surprisingly fragile. Although publicly thanking the new \nForeign Secretary Robin Cook, they suspected him of capitu\u00ad\nlating on the matter of a no-strike deal, and were sufficiently \nanxious to write to him asking him to deny rumours to this \neffect. Despite plaintive reassurances from Tony Blair, the last \nremaining GCHQ trade unionists expected to be sold down the \nriver. In fact, Cook went for a voluntary agreement, exactly as \nthe GCHQ Trade Union Campaign desired.40 The complex process \nof negotiating the' collective agreement' began with the Director \nof GCHQ, Kevin Tebhit, making it clear that he wanted 'no \noutside inducement to disruption'. The only sticking point was \nthat the unions wanted an agreement on non -disruption by \narbitration, while the managers desired a solid legal agreementY \nIRA terrorism stood out as the seemingly perennial sigint target \nin the early 1990s. Down the years, perhaps GCHQ's biggest \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 499 \ncontribution in Northern Ireland was in the electronic war \nagainst the radio-controlled bombs used by terrorists. Once the \nIRA moved away from old-fashioned command wires towards \nradio-controlled bombs, researchers at GCHQ came up with \nspecial equipment that inundated the Province with random \nradio signals on the bomb command frequencies. This caused \na number of bombs to detonate while they were being \nconstructed and tested. It was only after a number of volun\u00ad\nteers had been killed or injured by their own bombs exploding \nin their secret workshops that the IRA realised what was \nhappening. A scientific war developed, with the IRA creating a \nnew type of bomb that was triggered by two separate coded \nsignals. GCHQ eventually discovered this, and took further coun\u00ad\ntermeasures, resulting in more IRA deaths. To counter this, the \nIRA tried to move to using other kinds of trigger, including \nadapting radar guns used by the police in speed trapsY \nThe main source of technical collection on the IRA was local \ntelephone tapping, most of which was undertaken by the Royal \nUlster Constabulary Special Branch, together with bugging with \nmicrophones facilitated by the Army and MI5. The scale of \nbugging was so great that in the 1980s extra Army personnel \nhad to be borrowed from units such as the Royal Electrical and \nMechanical Engineers to do the work. Telephone interception \nwas an especially skilled business because of the sensitivity of \nthe IRA to surveillance. The core analysis was provided by about \nthirty women working for the RUC in a building nicknamed \n'the hen house', where real-time listening continued twenty\u00ad\nfour hours a day. The analysts required the most acute skills, \nsince it was often the inflection in a voice, the particular way \nin which someone said, 'Are you coming out for a drink then?', \nor even a period of silence, that suggested imminent activity. \nGCHQ had responsibility for longer-distance communications, \nincluding telephone lines between Northern Ireland, the British \nmainland and the Republic of Ireland. The IRA was known to \nrun its own ingenious sigint operations, dismantling old tele\u00ad\nvision sets to obtain UHFIVHF receivers to allow them to listen \n500 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nin on the high-frequency radios used by the Army and the \nRUC.43 \nIntelligence was no less vital during the mid-1990s, when \nthe British government had entered into tentative dialogue with \nthe Republicans. Key participants included Sinn Fein's Martin \nMcGuinness and senior British government figures including \nMo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland Secretary, and Jonathan \nPowell, Tony Blair's Chief of Staff. Blair's immediate circle soon \nnoticed that the Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams was sensi\u00ad\ntive to surveillance, and 'went without a mobile ... because he \nknew he could be tracked on it'.44 Like not a few government \nMinisters, Mo Mowlam struggled to deal with the intricacies of \nusing intercepts. She was regularly provided with transcripts of \nIRA conversations derived from surveillance, yet she would \ndiscuss sensitive political subjects, such as her battle to stop the \nPrime Minister sacking her, with Martin McGuinness in circum\u00ad\nstances in which she was also likely to be captured by British \ntechnical collection. More alarmingly, she sometimes introduced \ndetails into her conversations with Adams and McGuinness that \nshe could only have been privy to from technical collection. \nThis led the Republicans to uncover listening devices in one of \ntheir key safe houses. In May 1998 the security agencies accused \nMowlam of revealing a listening operation that had been \nmounted against Gerry Kelly, a leading Sinn Fein official living \nin Belfast. A wooden rafter in his house had been hollowed out \nand packed full of listening equipment, which had been \nproviding good intelligence for three years.45 Needless to say, \nthe intelligence and security services did not consider Mo \nMowlam their all-time-favourite Northern Ireland Secretary. \nThe most striking physical feature of GCHQ's participation in \nthe imelligence war against the IRA was a lSO-foot-high concrete \ntower built in 1989 within a secure compound at Capenhurst \nin Cheshire owned by British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. It was on a \ndirect line between the British Telecom Medium Wave Tower \nat Holyhead in Anglesey and another tower at Sutton Common \nnear Macclesfield, a microwave link which carried most of the \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 501 \ntelephone calls between mainland Britain and Ireland. The tower \ncontained seven floors of secret monitoring equipment and three \nfloors of aerials. Its staff were rumoured to be drawn from the \nRoyal Radar Establishment at Malvern. The tower was closed \nin 1998 when the Irish government protested strongly and \ninsisted on telephone calls being sent by a different route. Over \na decade the Capenhurst tower had allowed GCHQ to intercept \na vast volume of telephone traffic for analysis. A similar station \non Croslieve Mountain in South Armagh is thought to have \ntaken traffic between Belfast and Dublin. This was a classic \nexample of the bonanza of clear voice material that could be \nprovided by microwave telephone interception. Unsurprisingly, \nduring the Peace Process in the 1990s the IRA was most anxious \nto see the physical architecture of surveillance in Northern \nIreland removed, including the watchtowers that bristled with \naerials and antennae.46 \nOn 15 August 1998, twenty-nine people died at the town of \nOmagh in County Tyrone in the most deadly bomb attack ever \ncarried out in Ireland. This was the work of a small break\u00ad\naway faction callen the 'Real IRA'. Recently, dramatic claims \nhave been made suggesting that the Omagh bombing could have \nbeen disrupted by the security forces had intelligence from \nGCHQ been properly utilised. BBC investigative journalists said \nthat GCHQ intercepted mobile phone calls from members of the \nReal IRA in the car carrying the bomb towards the target, and \nthat these should have indicated that a major attack was being \nlaunched. There is no doubt that the RUC had asked for the \nmobiles in question to be given a very high priority for moni\u00ad\ntoring. Ray White, a former Assistant Chief Constable in the \nRUC, recalls that Special Branch had requested 'live' monitoring \nof particular mobile phone numbers in the hope of stopping \nsuch attacks. \nIn September 2008 the BBC's Panorama claimed that just ninety \nminutes before the attack, GCHQ captured a call to a suspect \nphone which contained the phrase: 'We're crossing the line: \nmeaning the car carrying the bombers was passing from Eire into \n502 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nNortheI!l Ireland. Forty minutes before the explosion, the words \n'The bricks are in the wall' were heard on the same phone, a \ncode understood to mean the bomb was in place. White claims \nthat when Special Branch later asked why the information came \nso late, GCHQ said: 'We missed it:47 Understandably, the asser\u00ad\ntions that GCHQ had intercepted mobile phone calls prior to the \ndetonation caused a public furore. Eventually the Intelligence \nCommissioner, Sir Peter Gibson, was called on to investigate. \nGCHQ is such a sensitive topic that Gibson's report was never \nmade public. Instead, a short summary was produced that was \nhedged around by the excruciating secrecy that still accompa\u00ad\nnies sigint. Nevertheless, to the discerning eye much was revealed. \nGibson effectively conceded that the mobile phones of the Real \nIRA were indeed being monitored live by GCHQ -which under\u00ad\nlines that these people were a very high priority. But there were \ntwo problems. First, the Real IRA knew this, and used obscure \ncode words. It is unlikely that the conversations GCHQ captured \nprior to the bombing indicated clearly that an attack was under \nway. Second, GCHQ had insisted on convoluted procedures that \nrestricted sigint very tightly to a few people in Northern Ireland. \nSome GCHQ staff had been lent out to RUe's intelligence head\u00ad\nquarters in Belfast; however, Gibson himself concedes that: \n* Once intercept material reached RUC HQ and Special \nBranch South, any further publication and release of that \nmaterial, even to another part, or other members, of Special \nBranch, was subject to strict conditions imposed by GCHQ \n... If those persons within the RUC HQ and Special Branch \nSouth who received intelligence from GCHQ wanted to \ndisseminate it within the RUC or even within Special \nBranch a set procedure had to be followed ... and a form \nof words cleared with GCHQ. \n* This was hardly a procedure designed to permit immediate \naction. Moreover, Gibson also shows that GCHQ had prioritised \nthe flow of sigint to RUC headquarters in Belf<.lsta.nu the border \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 503 \nareas. Omagh was in a quiet area west of Belfast, and had been \ngiven a lower priority.48 Whatever the shortcomings of the \nsystem, it remains unlikely that the security forces could have \nresponded in the limited time-frame available. Even with the \nmost attentive real-time listening, for GCHQ to have analysed \nthe conversations, contacted the right units in Northern Ireland, \nand for them in turn to have put several roadblocks in place, \nin a little more than an hour, is improbable. Quite simply, in \nreal life, response times are not that fast.49 \nMuch more convincing are the complaints about the way in \nwhich the dead hand of sigint security rules impeded the subse\u00ad\nquent police investigation. GCHQ shared intelligence with the \nRUC Special Branch, which it saw as another intelligence service, \nbut not with the CID officers pursuing the criminal investiga\u00ad\ntions. Gibson concedes that this led to 'a tension between Special \nBranch and CID'.50 GCHQ's voice recordings might well have \nassisted in the CID's subsequent efforts to identify and arrest \nthe perpetrators. Instead they spent months trawling through \ncall logs, in effect doing their own more primitive sigint, and \nas a result the trail went cold.51 \nThe Omagh bombing underlined that 'need to share' was a \nmajor problem right across the British intelligence community. \nThe sort of targets that were of rising importance in the late \n1990s, including Middle Eastern terrorists, Colombian drug \ncartels and warlords in the former Yugoslavia, required closer \nand faster cooperation with MIS and SIS. A well-worn system \nof liaison already existed. GCHQ had a small unit called 'Z \nDivision', whose job it was to pass material to the other secret \nservices and to agree on the use to which it could be put. \nHowever, the formal regulations surrounding the use of sigint, \ncalled 'IRSIG', largely drawn up by NSA, were proving cumber\u00ad\nsome and made 'Action On' very difficult. ('Action On' was the \nphrase used to indicate permission to share sigint with colleagues \nwith a view to taking positive action.) GCHQ's instinct was \nalways to hide it,S source. Now, a younger generation of MIS \n504 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nand SIS officers was tending to bypass these obstacles, prefer\u00ad\nring to meet up informally with GCHQ personnel in the pleasant \nCotswolds pubs around Cheltenham. This was a grassroots revolt, \nand during the late 1990s top managers in the British intelli\u00ad\ngence community had to accept the new trend. Organic connec\u00ad\ntions were developing fast between the three secret agencies \nunder the pressure of fast-moving day-to-day operations. 52 \nIn the summer of 1998, after only six months in office, Kevin \nTebbit handed over to Francis Richards, who would be GCHQ's \nfourth Director in as many years. Like his immediate prede\u00ad\ncessors, Richards was an outsider, but he was not entirely unac\u00ad\nquainted with the secret world. He had served in the Army, \nincluding on Cyprus, and had then joined the diplomatic service. \nHis father, Brooks Richards, had served in SOE during the war, \nand had been Cabinet Office Coordinator of Intelligence in the \nlate 1970s. For Richards, and for Britain's other intelligence \nchiefs, one of the pleasing aspects of the Blair administration \nwas that the Prime Minister took intelligence seriously, partly \nbecause of his abiding enthusiasm for military intervention. \nHowever, in the late 1990s the emerging security issue was the \nrising tide of global organised crime. In early December 1999, \nRichards joined the Chief of SIS and the Director General of \nMIS in an extended meeting at Downing Street on the 'crime \nemergency' facing Britain, including the threat from the Russian \nMafia. GCHQ was asked to work more closely with the National \nCriminal Intelligence Service and to help set up a new unit \ncalled the Government Telecommunications Advisory Centre, \nwhich addressed the growing use of email and encrypted \ncomputers by organised crime.53 \nBy the late 1990s the main threats that preoccupied govern\u00ad\nment arose from shadowy non-state organisations rather than \nforeign countries. They included terrorism, organised crime and \nwarlordism, together with a proliferation of private networks inter\u00ad\nested in nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The common \nelement among these new threats was that many of them oper\u00ad\nated clandestinely. The British response was to give more emphasis \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 505 \nto intelligence-led activity. Indeed, as Britain's borders became \nmore porous, and with the growing volumes of international trade, \nthere was little else that could be done. The expansion of the \nEuropean Union seemed to suggest practically an open frontier \nfor Britain that extended as far as the Urals.54 In June 2000 the \nshocking discovery of fifty-eight Chinese illegal immigrants who \nhad perished in a container lorry at Dover highlighted how serious \nthese matters were. The government was now reversing the cuts \nit had imposed on the intelligence agencies, because they seemed \na plausible antidote to these intractable problems.55 \nGCHQ's contributions in this realm were valuable. This was \nillustrated by the capture of the exceedingly dangerous crim\u00ad\ninal Kenneth Noye. In 1996 Noye was the prime suspect in the \nnotorious murder of Stephen Cameron in a road-rage incident \non the M25 motorway. The perpetrator fled the motorway junc\u00ad\ntion where the attack took place in a black Range Rover. Noye \nwas also linked to a string of high-profile crimes, including the \ndisposal of the assets from the Brinks Mat bullion robbery at \nHeathrow airport in 1983. After the murder, Noye slipped \nabroad: the police would visit no fewer than thirteen countries, \nincluding Russia and northern Cyprus, in their quest for him. \nHuge efforts were made to keep the search secret, since some \npolice officers and one senior politician were thought to be in \nNoye's pay. All the police had to go on were reports that he \nwas in Spain and his current mobile phone number. In 1998 \nGCHQ used cell-site tracking of his mobile phone to identify \nhis movements, and this allowed him to be located in Spain, \ndespite numerous false identities. Stephen Cameron's girlfriend, \nDanielle Cable, who had witnessed the M25 murder, was flown \nout to Spain to assist in his identification. One evening Noye \nwas eating dinner in an expensive restaurant when four under\u00ad\ncover detectives in T-shirts and shorts surprised him and hand\u00ad\ncuffed him. Britain's most wanted criminal had been caught. \nJack Straw, the Home Secretary, signed Public Interest Immunity \ncertificates on 8 February 2000 to ensure that details of GCHQ's \nrole in finding Noye were not revealed in court.56 \n506 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nThe -police were so anxious about the safety ot their witnesses \nthat they were protected in a police station in north London \nwith three separate air locks. Each witness was guarded by an \narmed policeman who had been specially vetted to ensure that \nhe had no links to south London, where Noye operated. This \ncaution was justified. Danielle Cable courageously gave evidence \nat Noye's trial in 2000, and was later given a new identity. Alan \nDecabral, an eye-witness to the murder who also gave evidence, \nrefused a new identity and was shot dead in his car in Ashford \nin Kent on 5 October 2001.57 To the dismay of GCHQ, its role \nin the effort against Noye was being discussed in the news\u00ad\npapers even before the case came to trial. This triggered a further \noperation, this time against journalists and their sources. Code\u00ad\nnamed 'Operation Nigeria', it caught journalists from tabloid \nnewspapers on tape during a surveillance operation that showed \nthey were procuring intelligence from a private detective agency \nwhich, in turn, obtained its information from corrupt police \nofficers. Over the summer of 1999 the detective agency in ques\u00ad\ntion, known as Southern Investigations, was secretly bugged by \nthe Metropolitan Police's anti-corruption squad, CIB3, and one \nleading figure was recorded discussing how he had sold a story \nto a reporter about GCHQ's role in tracking down Noye. It was \nalso found that Southern Investigations had an informant in \nthe Diplomatic Protection Squad at Buckingham Palace.58 \nNo one could possibly argue that the identification and arrest \nof Kenneth Noye was anything other than an immense public \ngood. Yet, because crime recognises no borders, this sort of work \nmeant that GCHQ was being inexorably drawn into the contro\u00ad\nversial realm of domestic surveillance as well as having to engage \nwith the contentious politics of internet privacy. During 1996 \nGCHQ and NSA had joined forces to put forward a solution to \nthe problem of publicly available encryption, called 'Key Escrow'. \nHowever, this idea had proved unworkable, and in any case the \nnew Blair government was unsympathetic to it. On 26 May 1999 \nStephen Byers, Secretary of State at the Department of nade and \nIndustry, revealed the latest thinking on 'Encryption and Law \nTHE NEW AGE OF UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING 507 \nEnforcement'. Speaking at the Cabinet Office, he confirmed that \n'Key Escrow' was finished, and now emphasised cooperating \nclosely with the computer industry rather than fighting it. The \ngovernment accepted that no single magic technique was likely \nto sustain interception in the face of rising use of encryption by \ncriminals. 59 Instead, it placed its hopes on new legislation called \nthe Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, under which \ncriminals would face serious penalties for refusing to offer up the \nkeys to encrypted material.60 \nIn addition, there would be a new dedicated computer unit \ncalled the Govemmem Technical Assistance Centre (GTAC) , \nintended to break the codes that criminals used to encrypt their \nemails and computer hard drives. While this was nominally a \nHome Office unit, in reality code-breaking and code-making \nalways meant GCHQ, and offidals joked privately that 'GTAC' \nactually stood for 'GCHQ Technical Assistance Centre'. Sure \nenough, in July 2000 GCHQ was asked to lend one of its top \nexperts, Brian Paterson, to the Home Office to establish the unit.61 \nEven Paterson called GTAC a 'euphemistic title' for what was in \neffect a code-cracking unit at the Home Office. He explained that \nmodern criminals tended to use the internet in three different \nways. First, as a simple extension of ordinary crimes, such as \nfraud, theft and smuggling. Second, there were crimes which had \nonly developed because of the existence of the internet, such as \nhacking and virus attacks.62 Third, there was the use of the \ninternet by criminals as a means of communications or storage. \nWhen it came to the third problem, Paterson explained that \ndomestic interception presented multiple difficulties. It required \nwarrants literally signed by the Home Secretary, 'even if it means \ngetting him out of bed'. Moreover, in the era of the internet, \ninterception was being made 'very much more difficult by new \ntechnology' .63 Surprisingly, GTAC was developed, staffed, and then \nlittle used. Always partly run by GCHQ, it was quietly transferred \nto Cheltenham in April 2006.64 \nThe number of criminals encrypting their emails and computer \nfiles proved to be fairly small. In fact, for a decade both NSA and \n508 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nGCHQ had been barking up the wrong tree in terms of their \nobsession with the dangers of Public Key Encryption. This was \na small problem, compared to the sheer explosion of open commu\u00ad\nnications' especially those based around the internet. In October \n2002 General Michael Hayden, Director of NSA, explained to \nCongress that in the 1990s the number of mobile phones in the \nworld had increased from sixteen million to 741 million. At the \nsame time, internet users went from about four million to 361 \nmillion. Half as many landlines were laid between 1994 and 2000 \nas in the whole previous history of the world. International tele\u00ad\nphone traffic we at from thirty-eight billion minutes a year to \nover a hundred billion.65 Both NSA and GCHQ were simply over\u00ad\nwhelmed by a tidal wave of data, despite the fact that almost \nnone of it was in code. One insider recounted that NSA had \ncreated a special facility with three years' worth of storage capacity \nfor intercepted internet traffic. 'They filled it in eleven months.'66 \nBy 2000, some intelligence chiefs had even begun to ques\u00ad\ntion the value of sigint in this era of superabundant commu\u00ad\nnication. GCHQ and NSA could collect all of this new traffic, \nbut they could not begin to listen to it or process it -so intel\u00ad\nligence chiefs were at a loss to know what to do with it. One \ndisillusioned code-breaker observed that it was like trying to \npour a glass of water with a firehose. The costs of collecting all \nthis material were huge, and the benefits were uncertain. In \nthe United States, the price of satellite collection was threat\u00ad\nening to overwhelm the whole intelligence budget, while in \nBritain the cost of transferring GCHQ's massive computers to \nthe new building had begun to rise alarmingly. More impor\u00ad\ntantly, the new sigint, which focused on emails and mobile \nphone calls, only worked if you knew precisely who you wanted \nto listen to, since trying to listen to everyone in a globalising \nworld was impossible. Was this the right kind of intelligence\u00ad\ngathering for the twenty-first century? Even as security agen\u00ad\ncies pondered this question, frightening events were lurking just \naround the corner that would give it a sharper edge.67 \n25 \nThe 9/11 Attacks and the Iraq War \nTomorrow is zero hour ... \nIntercepted phone message, 10 September 20011 \nShortly before 3 o'clock on the afternoon of 11 September 2001, \nTony Blair was speaking before the Trades Union Congress in \nBrighton. His speech was hastily improvised, and was far removed \nfrom the subject he had expected to speak about. In the previous \nhour he had been informed of dramatic events unfolding in New \nYork, where it was still morning. Tvvo passenger aircraft laden \nwith fuel had just hit the twin towers of the World Trade Center, \nwhich were soon billowing infernos. It was already clear that \nthis was a deliberate attack, and Blair told his audience: 'This \nmass terrorism is the new evil in our world today.' At 2.59 p.m. \nBritish time, almost as Blair left the podium, the South Tower \ncollapsed. The unprecedented scale of destruction was just begin\u00ad\nning to dawn on the Prime Minister's immediate circle. \nSpecial Branch officers were worried about an attack on Blair's \ncar, perhaps by helicopter, so he was taken back to London by \ntrain. Later that afternoon he spoke to his intelligence chiefs, \nwho were almost certc.in that the Islamic terrorist organisation \nal Qaeda was responsible. John Scarlett, Chair of the Joint \nIntelligence Committee, offered the view that it was the only \ngroup with the capability to mount such an attack. Blair was \nan avid reader of intelligence, but al Qaeda was not familiar to \nhim. At 5.30 he chaired a formal meeting of 'Cobra', the Cabinet \nemergency planning committee, in its special bunker under \n510 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nWhitehall, which focused on the imminent threat to Britain. \nPrivately, his main anxiety was that the Americans might over\u00ad\nreact, retaliating immediately and massively.2 The next day, the \nheads of the three British intelligence and security services flew \nto Washington to express solidarity and to underline their deter\u00ad\nmination to do everything to assist. It was a gesture that was \ngreatly appreciated by the Americans.3 \nIn London, the Stock Exchange had been evacuated on the \nday of the attack, along with Canary Wharf. The skies over \nLondon, Paris and other European capitals had been closed to \ncivilian air traffic. Cabinet Ministers felt safe enough meeting \nin 'Cobra', deep below ground, but eventually normal routines \nhad to resume. The Labour Party conference in Brighton was \nonly a few weeks away, and security for the Cabinet there was \nnow a massive headache. The Ministry of Defence wanted to \npark a warship armed with surface-to-air missiles just off the \nseafront in case 'unauthorised planes looked as if they were \ngoing to attack the conference centre or the hotel'. David \nBlunkett, the Home Secretary, thought this was a little exces\u00ad\nsive. It was then suggested that missiles should be mounted on \nthe roof of the conference centre, or in lorries nearby. In the \nend, the security forces settled for crash barriers to prevent \nvehicle-borne bombs.4 \nIn America, an intelligence post-mortem had already begun. \nOn 10 September NSA had intercepted two messages from \nAfghanistan. One of them said 'The match is about to begin: \nand the other 'Tomorrow is zero hour: The messages were in \nArabic, and were not translated until the day after the attacks. \nMuch was made of these messages in the weeks and months \nthat followed, but their significance is now debatable. Even had \nthey been translated immediately, they were not actionable. \nAlthough they appear to allude to an impending attack, they \ndo not specify where, when or how. 'On Sept. 12 when they \nlooked at these intercepts, no one knew who these people were: \nnoted one official. 5 \nAl Qaeda had been NSA's number-one target since 7 August \nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 511 \n1998, when it had bombed the American Embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania.6 By contrast, GCHQ had begun to take a \npronounced interest in the organisation only relatively recently. \nThe Director of GCHQ, Francis Richards, confirmed that the al \nQaeda leader Osama bin Laden had only been 'a major preoc\u00ad\ncupation' for Cheltenham since 2000.7 Nevertheless, GCHQ had \npicked up some of the growing 'chatter' during the summer of \n2001, including messages to Middle Eastern journalists based in \nLondon. There was much talk about impending attacks, and \nWestern embassies were already on high alert. On 6 August the \ncrescendo of imprecise warnings had resulted in a section of \nPresident Bush's Daily Brief headed 'Bin Laden Determined to \nStrike in the US', which underlined the al Qaeda leader's deter\u00ad\nmination to retaliate for previous Cruise-missile strikes against \nhis training compounds in Afghanistan. It also reminded Bush \nthat al Qaeda had bombed the World Trade Center in 1993. But \nno intercept gave any direct indication of the time or place of \nthe planned attacks. Senior members of the Bush Cabinet were \nsceptical about the idea that al Qaeda was responsible for the \nattacks on the twin towers and the Pentagon, and Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld went so far as to say the intercepted \nmessages were possibly a hoax or a deception.s \nAfter 9/11, the sigint agencies found themselves in crisis. For \nmuch of the 1990s the absence of a single high-profile threat \nhad led to cuts in their budgets, just at the time when NSA and \nGCHQ were struggling to keep up with rapid changes in commu\u00ad\nnications technology. Indeed, one of the problems later identi\u00ad\nfied by the 9111 Commission set up to inquire into the attacks \nwas that the intelligence agencies had taken on very few new \nstaff in the 1990s. In the wake of 9111 they moved from famine \nto feast, and after further terrorist attacks such as that in Bali \nin October 2002, money was no object. Everywhere there were \ncalls for more intelligence, and for wider international cooper\u00ad\nation between intelligence and security services. Even the United \nNations, an institution that was traditionally allergic to intelli\u00ad\ngence agencies, passed Security Council Resolution 1373, which \n512 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nplaced a legal duty on all states to 'find ways of intensifying and \naccelerating the exchange of operational information, especially \nregarding actions or movements of terrorist persons or networks'. 9 \nImmediately after 9/11. GCHQ doubled the size of its counter\u00ad\nterrorism team. However, the attacks underlined the weakness \nof the sigint agencies. Over the past decade, not only had they \nlost the battle over Public Key Encryption, but they were \ncollecting more data than they could remotely process. NSA and \nGCHQ possessed phenomenal computing power, but it was being \noutstripped by the scale of the global communications revolu\u00ad\ntion. Moreover, while only a small number of people were using \npublicly available encryption, many more were being careful \nabout their communications. Interception was no longer secret, \nand monitoring was widely reported in the press. Groups like \nal Qaeda had become aware that they were vulnerable to eaves\u00ad\ndropping. Warlords, terrorists and criminals were starting to \nengage in opaque conversations, placing an even greater strain \non the analysts, since intercepted messages were increasingly \nfilled with the verbal equivalent of nods and winks which \nrequired a highly trained ear to deduce their meaning. Some \nof the nods and winks were in Pashtu, Farsi and other obscure \nlanguages. NSA and GCHQ were having to run fast to stand \nstill. 10 \nLanguage had been a major challenge for the sigint agencies \nfor a decade. In the early 1990s the war in Bosnia had required \nGCHQ to make a significant investment of effort in the Balkans. \nBy the late 1990s this was paying dividends, and policy-makers \ncomplimented Cheltenham on the 'flexible and in-depth service' \nit provided during Britain's involvement in Kosovo.ll In 1999, \nwhen NATO air forces launched a massive air offensive against \nthe Serbs, almost all the bombing targets were pinpointed by \nsigint provided by GCHQ and NSA.12 The former Yugoslavia had \nremained a subject of constant interest to British policy-makers \nfor an entire decade, but it was now common for target coun\u00ad\ntries to change rapidly, and GCHQ conceded that it was expe\u00ad\nriencing difficulties in recruiting personnel who were familiar \nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 513 \nwith rarer languages. Although there were people in Britain \nwith the required skills, many did not meet the residency \nrequirement necessary to pass security vetting.13 \nThe 9111 Commission that investigated the attacks on the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon examined how much al \nQaeda knew about the fact that it was being listened to by the \nsigint agencies. It specifically pointed to a Washington Times article \nin 1998 which, it claimed, resulted in bin Laden deciding to \ncease making calls from a portable satellite phone. Others have \nargued that the bombarding of his encampment with Cruise \nmissiles only a few days before the article appeared might also \nhave sent the message that he needed to be a little more careful \nwith his communications. What is certain is that NSA had charts \non its walls that showed how mobile-phone chatter and email \nvolumes amongst terrorists dropped off markedly after each \nreference to interception in the international press. In fact, NSA \nhad only itself to blame, since it had enjoyed showing off to \nvisiting politicians at its Fort Meade headquarters by playing \ntapes of bin Laden talking to his mother on his satellite phone.14 \nThe agency has since made an active effort to educate media \ncorrespondents on this issue.l5 \nBecause of the extreme caution terrorists now employed \nwhen using communications, GCHQ and NSA were sometimes \nreduced to 'traffic analysis', examining patterns of calls in order \nto deduce the groups they sketched out. Sigint rarely revealed \nplans or plots, but it could identify terrorist networks. \nIncreasingly sophisticated software, often using neural network \ncomputers, was able to dredge useful data from something as \nsimple as a list of numbers that had been called from a partic\u00ad\nular phone -often known as a call log. GCHQ also began to \nnotice a regular phenomenon. In the week before 9111, and \nalso before the Bali bombing and the suicide attacks in Riyadh \nin early 2003, there was a surge in 'electronic chatter', followed \nby a period of silence before each attack. Some groups were \nclearly aware that GCHQ's computers were programmed to sniff \nemail traffic for key words. For example, emails from the \n514 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nkidnappers of the American journalist Daniel Pearl, who was \nmurdered by his captors in early 2002, contained deliberately \nmisspelled words, such as 'Amreeka', 'Terrarism' and 'Pakstan', \ndesigned to avoid alerting the authorities.16 Nevertheless, good \ncommunications security discipline is difficult, and one slip by \nthe terrorists could give away a key player.17 \nTerrorists and drug dealers alike had also learned to change \ntheir mobile phones and sim cards frequently, as often as once \nevery three days. The sigint agencies responded by using \nrecorded 'voice prints', which allowed them to search volumes \nof traffic for people who 'sounded like' the suspects. The British \nwere apparently the first to provide an authentic recording of \nbin Laden's voice, which was then used in this way. IS The tech\u00ad\nnique also revealed the location of Ramzi Binalshibh, a senior \nal Qaeda operative who was caught in Pakistan in September \n2002. It appears that a sample of his voice, taken from an al\u00ad\nJazeera television interview, was used to conduct a computer \nsearch against vast volumes of telephone traffic collected by \nsatellite. Exactly a year after the 9/11 attacks, on the morning \nof Wednesday, 11 September 2002, the Pakistani intelligence \nservice, lSI, surrounded a four-storey block of flats in Karachi. \nTheir initial assault surprised five men who had returned to \nbed in one of the apartments after early-morning prayers. While \nthey were being taken out at gunpoint, sympathisers in the \nadjacent apartment threw a grenade at the intelligence offi\u00ad\ncers. A gun battle developed, and those inside hurled more \ngrenades at the authorities.19 Terrified neighbours called the \nlocal police, who were unaware of the super-secret activities \nof the lSI. In the ensuing confusion twenty policemen were \ninjured, many by friendly fire.20 Ramzi Binalshibh was among \nthose captured. \nIn the spring of 2003 an intercepted email led to the arrest \nof Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was very close to bin Laden, \nand had been a key figure in the planning of the 9/11 attacks.21 \nHe was arrested at a house in Rawalpindi in a joint operation \nby lSI and the CIA's paramilitary force, the Special Activities \nTHE 9111 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 515 \nDivision,22 and taken to one of the CIA's secret prisons in \nnorthern Poland, whei'e the US government has confirmed that \nhe was repeatedly subjected to 'simulated drowning', or 'water\u00ad\nboarding', Some of the information extracted from him related \nto Britain. Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, the Director General \nof MIS, has commented: \n* When he was in detention in 2003, place unknown, he \nprovided [the pseudonyms of] six individuals ... who were \ninvolved in AQ activities in or against the UK. The \nAmericans gave us this information ... These included \nhigh-profile terrorists -an illustration of the huge amount \nof significant information that came from one man in deten\u00ad\ntion in an unknown place.23 \n* Interception had led to the capture of key suspects and inform-\nants, Thereafter, however, their handling left much to be desired, \nCruelty and incompetence stood in for what should have been \na sophisticated and patient in-depth interrogation. For example, \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed was mostly questioned by a CIA \nofficer who had never previously conducted an interrogation, \nand who did not speak Arabic.24 \nDuring 2002, both the British public and the security agen\u00ad\ncies remained convinced that Islamic terrorism was something \nthat happened abroad.25 However, in February 2003 the mood \ndarkened following a warning of an imminent attack on \nHeathrow provided by GCHQ. At 6 o'clock on the morning of \nTuesday, 11 February, Tony Blair authorised the deployment of \n1, 500 armed police and troops at the airport, together with light \ntanks from the Household Cavalry. A Nimrod MR2 reconnais\u00ad\nsance aircraft patrolled the skies overhead to provide an imme\u00ad\ndiate communications link-up for the forces. GCHQ had picked \nup information of an imminent 'spectacular' by extremists in \nLondon, involving a plan to smuggle Russian-made shoulder\u00ad\nlaunched Sam-7 surface-to-air missiles into the country, with \nthe intention of bringing down an airliner. Almost immediately \n516 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nthis was conflated by some journalists with government efforts \nto prepare public opinion for war with Iraq. John Reid, the \nDefence Secretary, reacted angrily to these suggestions, and \ninsisted that the Heathrow plot was real: 'This is not a game. \nThis is about a threat of the nature that massacred thousands \nof people in New York.'26 \nBy 2003, counter-terrorism represented GCHQ's single largest \nallocation of effort. Moreover, the agency decided to increase \nits counter-terrorism activity by half as much again in 2004-\n05. Inevitably, t.his meant cuts elsewhere. It was decided to \ndecrease collection in most geographical areas, and even to \nreduce the attention given to the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons. The only area that remained untouched was serious \ncrime. Languages remained a problem at every level of sigint, \nwhether at Cheltenham or on the front line, where, typically, \nexotic-language skills were required for the crews of Nimrod \nRls flying sigint missions over Afghanistan. GCHQ established \na specialist office in which staff (particularly linguists) who could \nnot be granted high -level clearance could still do useful trans\u00ad\nlation work. However, the Nimrod crews were often 50 per cent \nshort of the ideal complement of linguists.27 \nEven while GCHQ was in the middle of a high-tempo counter\u00ad\nterrorist campaign, ic was confronted with the distracting issue \nof Iraq. Political leaders in London and Washington were keen \nto highlight the country's reluctance to comply with UN reso\u00ad\nlutions requiring it to disarm. They now wanted to use secret \nintelligence for public education. For years Britain had insisted \nthat intelligence from MIS, SIS and GCHQ was deadly secret. \nSuddenly, the Cabinet Office now decided that intelligence mat\u00ad\nerial should be disseminated to the general public in two dossiers. \nThe first, produced on 24 September 2002, claimed to reveal \nthe Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's continued nuclear, chem\u00ad\nical and biological weapons activity. The second, released on 3 \nFebruary 2003, dealt with Saddam's security agencies and the \npersecution of his people. The idea of war with Iraq was highly \nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 517 \ncontroversial, since the country appeared to have little connec\u00ad\ntion with 9111 or the current concerns about al Qaeda, and the \nunprecedented step of placing intelligence in the public domain \nto support the case for war raised a political storm. Journalists \naccused the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, Alastair Campbell, \nof undue influence in the intelligence process, and Campbell \nreacted angrily. Downing Street and the BBC then engaged in \na prolonged sparring match throughout early 2003. For GCHQ, \nthe dossier issues were relatively peripheral, since most of the \nintelligence Britain had gathered on Iraq's weapons came from \nhuman agents or defectors held by allied countries.28 \nHowever, if GCHQ thought it was comfortably out of the \nfiring line on Iraq, it was wrong. At this point Blair had persuaded \nGeorge Bush, rather against the President's judgement, to seek \na second resolution in the UN Security Council, in the hope of \nstrengthening the case for war. On Sunday, 2 March, the Observer \nrevealed a highly sensitive memo from NSA to GCHQ asking \nfor an accelerated eavesdropping campaign against the non\u00ad\npermanent members of the Security Council, such as Chile and \nMexico. This was intended to permit greater diplomatic pres\u00ad\nsure to be applied to these smaller countries, whose votes were \ncritical in the American effort to build support for military action \nagainst Iraq. The publication of this message caused an inter\u00ad\nnational furore. Sent by Frank Koza, a mid-level manager at \nNSA, it not only revealed the monitoring of allies and neutral \nnations, but also seemed to suggest the gerrymandering of votes \nin the hallowed councils of the United Nations. Unusually, the \nObserver printed it in full on its front page: \n518 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \n* To: [Recipients withhe:d] \nFrom: FRANK KOZA, Def Chief of Staff (Regional Targets) \nCIV/NSA \nSent on Jan 31 2003 0:16 \nSubject: Reflections of Iraq DebateNotes at UN-RT Actions + \nPotential for Related Contributions \nImportance: HIGH \nTop Secretl/COMINTIIX1 \nAll, \nAs you've likely heard by now, the Agency is mounting a surge \nparticularly directed at the UN Security Council (UNSC) members \n(minus US and GBR of course) for insights as to how the member\u00ad\nship is reacting to the on-going debate RE: Iraq, plans to vote on \nany related resolutions, what related policies/negotiating positions \nthey may be considering, alliances/dependencies, etc -the whole \ngamut of information that could give US policymakers an edge in \nobtaining results favorable to US goals or to head off surprises.

Their votes were being \neagerly sought by both pro-war and anti-war factions. Pakistan \nand Bulgaria were thought to favour the United States, although \nit was by no means certain, while the rest were undecided. Nine \nvotes were needed in the fifteen-member Security Council to \napprove a second resolution authorising military action against \nIraq. Blair needed this resolution badly, but it was thought to \nbe a close-run thing.30 \nThe international atmosphere was febrile. Sigint was being \npublicly discussed everywhere. Intelligence experts were not \nsurprised by the leaked Koza message, observing that listening \nin on the United Nations was routine. Indeed, in 1945 the \nUnited States had pressed for the UN headquarters to be in New \nYork precisely in order to make eavesdropping easier.31 However, \nthe memo did a great deal of diplomatic damage to the British \nand American positions.32 During early March Tony Blair was \nbecoming increasingly frantic about securing a majority vote in \nthe Security CounciL since he felt his position as Prime Minister \nmight depend on it.33 In Chile, the public had long been sensi\u00ad\ntive to reports of 'dirty tricks' by intelligence agencies because \nof the alleged CIA coup that installed the dictator General \nAugusto Pinochet in 1973.34 President Ricardo Lagos telephoned \nBlair on Sunday, 2 March, within hours of the Observer story \nappearing, and then twice again on the following Wednesday. \nThe country's Foreign Minister, Soledad Alvear, fired a series of \nawkward questions about GCHQ at his opposite number in \nBritain, Jack Straw. 35 \nThe Mexican government was no less angry, and there were \nheated telephone calls to Downing Street. Months later the \nMexicans were still pursuing the matter with Straw. The Mexican \nForeign Minister wrote to him in December 2003, pressing him \nagain on whether GCHQ was still spying on its friends in the \nUnited Nations. Aguilar Zinser, who had been Mexican \nAmbassador to the United Nations at the time, later explained \n520 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nthat in the week before what was expected to be a second reso\u00ad\nlution, the diplomat:> from the 'Group of Six' were in fact \nworking on their own secret plans for a compromise solution \nwhich they hoped would avert war. 'Only the people in the \nroom knew what the document said,' recalls Zinser. He added \nthat the surprising thing was the very rapid nature of the \nAmerican response to the proposal. The meeting putting it \ntogether took place in the evening, and Zinser received a call \nfrom US diplomats early the next morning. He told them the \ngroup was looking for a compromise. The Americans' response \nwas: 'Do not attempt it.' In the end it was the French who \npulled the plug on the possibility of a second UN resolution. \nOn 10 March President Jacques Chirac announced that France \nwould use its veto in the Security Council to block any such \nmove, resulting in public acrimony between Paris and \nWashington. Few realised that war was now only ten days \naway.36 \nAlthough the French and German governments were strongly \nopposed to war with Iraq, their own intelligence services insisted \nthat the country had an active weapons of mass destruction \n(WMD) programme. The fact that the respected German BND \nloudly asserted this, even though Chancellor Gerhard Schroder \nwas opposed to war, convinced many independent observers \nthat there must be some hard evidence of Iraqi WMD. The \nFrench DGSE was also telling President Chirac that Iraq had \nWMD. However, the sagacious Chirac made his own assess\u00ad\nments, and believed that the Western intelligence services were \ndeluded. In January 2003 he visited Hans Blix, the head of the \nUN Monitoring, Inspection and Verification Commission, who \nhad been searching Iraq for evidence of WMD for many years. \nBlix recalls that by then his team 'had begun to have some \ndoubts', although, by and large, even he still thought Iraq was \nhiding some weapons. By contrast, Chirac was highly suspi\u00ad\ncious, and 'was among the first who doubted the intelligence \nreports'. He understood how the Western intelligence agencies \nworked, continually bringing their specialists together and devel-\nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 521 \noping a collective outlook that is often called 'groupthink'. Chirac \nput it rather well, asserting that the intelligence agencies had \ntended to 'intoxicate each other'.37 \nThe leaked message to GCHQ reverberated for a long time. \nOne of the challenges that had faced the Observer, before \npublishing it, had been verifying it as genuine. The world's top \nexperts on sigint were certain that it was the real thing. James \nBamford noted that words such as 'surge' and 'product lines' \nwere NSA 'lingo', while Matthew Aid revealed that the purported \nauthor, Frank Koza, was indeed a senior operational manager \nat NSA.38 They did not have to wait long for confirmation. A \nfew days after the story was published, Katharine Gun, a twenty\u00ad\neight-year-old Mandarin linguist at GCHQ, walked into the \nCheltenham headquarters and told her supervisor, 'The leaker \nis me.' This was a surprise for GCHQ managers, who had never \nhad a serious 'whistle blower' . SIS had struggled to silence its \nown whistleblower, Richard Tomlinson, in the 1990s, even \narranging a dream job for him with a Formula One racing team \nin the hope of keeping him quiet. MIS had pursued another \nwhistleblower, the eccentric David Shayler, through the courts, \nand had tried to prevent its own former Director GeneraL Stella \nRimington, from publishing her memoirs. However, Cheltenham \nsomehow never quite thought it would happen to them.39 \nKatharine Gun's decision to expose the NSA message was taken \non the spur of the moment. On Friday, 31 January 2003 she had \ngone to work at GCHQ as usual. At about 10 o'clock she opened \nher emails. 'I could not believe what was on the screen,' she \nsaid. 'My thoughts were racing, really bizarre thoughts for me. I \nhad never intended to do anything like that ... ' In other words, \nshe had not been looking for material to leak, but now she felt \nshe was privy to the 'most secret workings of top government'. \nMoreover, it struck her that this document -if leaked -might \nwell be used to impede military action against Iraq. Gun's critics \nhave since denounced her for naIvety, asserting that someone \nworking for GCHQ should have understood that sigint agencies \nmonitor everyone, including friends and neutrals, even the United \n522 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nNations. Her response to this was that the memo exposed a lie. \nLondon and Washington claimed to be working for a diplomatic \nsolution, but in fact they seemed to be trying to avoid one.40 \nThey also seemed to be trying to manipulate the key vote in the \nSecurity Council by 'bullying' the smaller members. She recalls \nbeing horrified and angry.4! \nThe Monday morning after the story broke, GCHQ began an \nimmediate leak inquiry, interviewing over a hundred staff who \nhad seen the email. Gun had not expected the Observer to repro\u00ad\nduce the entire text on the front page, and had been 'absolutely \nterrified' when she saw it. Although she denied her action during \nher security interview, a few days later her nerve crumbled and \nshe confessed to her line manager. She was taken to GCHQ's \nSecurity Division, then interviewed by Special Branch from \nLondon. She never returned to GCHQ.42 The case, which ran \nfor over a year, was headline news. To her supporters she was \nthe 'the spy who tried to stop a war'. Others were less compli\u00ad\nmentary. David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, insisted that the \nNSA memo had been 'doctored' before publication, and believed \nthat Gun was motivated by the fact that her husband, a Kurdish \nasylum-seeker, was being removed from the countryY \nNo less significant than the leaked email from NSA was \nanother message that had been sent to all staff in GCHQ the \nprevious week. The issue of possible war against Iraq was causing \ngrowing anxiety among staff at Cheltenham, and a senior offi\u00ad\ncial had tried to address their concerns, assuring them that they \nwould not be asked to participate in anything unlawful, and \nthat British troops would not go into action unless the Attorney \nGeneral, Lord Goldsmith, had advised the Prime Minister that \nit was legal. This was to prove important nine months later, \nsince Katharine Gun's acquittal of charges under the Official \nSecrets Act turned precisely upon the Attorney General's legal \nopinion on military action. Because of the GCHQ email under\u00ad\nlining the importance of lawfulness, Gun's defence team asked \nto see the full text of Goldsmith's opinion on the legality of the \nIraq War. At this point the government's lawyers crumbled. \nTHE 9111 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 523 \nDespite the fact that Gun had admitted her actions, the Crown \nProsecution Service dropped the case 'for lack of evidence' within \ntwenty-four hours. The government did not wish to reveal \nGoldsmith's full legal opinion under any circumstances, since it \nwas equivocal. This in turn underlined the fact that journalists \nhad been barking up the wrong tree with their obsession over \nthe Iraq dossiers, their testy arguments with Alastair Campbell \nand the supposed fact that Saddam would be capable of \ndeploying his WMD at forty-five minutes' notice. The Katharine \nGun case showed, rather belatedly, that some of the bigger issues \nrelating to the approach of war had been missed by the press.44 \nGCHQ monitoring of the United Nations remained stubbornly \nin the headlines. In February 2004, Clare Short, who had resigned \nher Cabinet post as Minister for Overseas Development, offered \nher own testimony about listening in on the UN, declaring on \nprime-time television that she had routinely seen sigint on \nSecretary General Kofi Annan's conversations that had taken \nplace in his private office at the UN headquarters in New York \nduring the period before the war. Just as with Mo Mowlam in \nNorthern Ireland in the 1990s, the whole matter of interception \nhad a rather surreal quality. Short said: 'I have seen transcripts \nof Kofi Annan's conversations. In fact, I have had conversations \nwith Kofi in the run-up to war thinking, \"Oh dear, there will \nbe a transcript of this, and people will see what he and I are \nsaying.\" '45 This was embarrassing, since it not only showed that \nGCHQ had been intercepting Annan's phone calls and emails, \nbut also that a clandestine listening device had been surrepti\u00ad\ntiously planted in his office.46 \nAs war drew closer, Clare Short took an unusual step. 'I had \ndecided that I ought to inform Kofi that transcripts of his conver\u00ad\nsations as well as draft papers were circulated by British intel\u00ad\nligence.' This monitoring had seemed harmless when Britain \nwas working closely with the Secretary General, but now she \nconsidered that it had become 'insidious'. When the Katharine \nGun case erupted, Short spoke on BBC Radio 4's Today \n524 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nprogramme and revealed that 'We were also spying on Kofi \nAnnan's office: Following this interview, she recalls, 'All hell \nbroke loose,' and she received a warning from Tony BlairY \nHowever, she was not deterred. On 29 February 2004 she was \na guest on the Jonathan Dimbleby programme on lTV. Here she \ndisplayed a letter from the Cabinet Secretary, Andrew Turnbull, \nrebuking her for discussing signals intelligence in public and \nthreatening her with unspecified 'further action' if she did not \nstop talking about GCHQ.48 \nGCHQ's most important potential military contribution to the \nwar against Iraq was in its first few hours. Reportedly, late on \n19 March 2003, Cheltenham discovered that Saddam Hussein \nwas meeting senior commanders at a house called Dora Farms \nin the prosperous Mansour district on the southern outskirts of \nBaghdad. A number of special forces personnel from Britain \nand the United States were already operating inside Baghdad, \nas were two members of Germany's BND. They were asked to \nconfirm the information. At about 6 o'clock on the morning of \n20 March, Baghdad time, the opening of hostilities saw two \nAmerican F-117 bombers hammer the area, dropping four two\u00ad\nthousand-pound bunker-busting bombs, leaving a crater sixty \nfeet deep.49 Two weeks later, the British asserted that they had \nintelligence from GCHQ that Saddam left the area minutes \nbefore the bombing, but had been injured. However, the CIA \nremained 'cautiously optimistic they got him'. Reporters later \ndiscovered that the bombs had missed their target, and had \ninstead flattened three neighbouring buildings. Reportedly, the \nstrike was triggered by the Iraqi leadership's use for communi\u00ad\ncations among themselves of an old system made by the British \ncompany Racal which had been monitored. 50 \nAccompanying Britain's land forces were two mobile sigint \nunits, in the form of the Army's 14 Signals Regiment and the \nRoyal Marines' Y Troop. Most of the staff of Y Troop flew out \nto Kuwait in the last week of January 2003. Usefully, some of \nthem had recently been on an eight-week Arabic course. They \nwere located at a Kuwaiti training camp, allowing some of their \nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 525 \ndetachments to be deployed to Mutlar Ridge, overlooking the \nIraqi frontier, which allowed them to test equipment and to \nliaise with the US Marines' 1 st Radio Battalion, which was also \na field sigint unit. After about a month, Y Troop spread out \nalong the border in small detachments to listen to the enemy \nand await instructions to advance. Their main equipment was \nthree Odette sigint systems, mounted on Land Rovers with their \ndistinctive twenty-foot aerials. However, there were technical \nproblems, so most of Y Troop was sent forward with smaller \nman packs as radio reconnaissance teams, working alongside \n40 Commando. This was front-line work, and they were soon \namongst the tanks of the Queen's Dragoon Guards, listening in \non enemy positions at very close range as British armour \nadvanced towards the southern town of Basra.51 \nEventually the technical problems with the Odette aerials \nwere fixed by 14 Signals Regiment, the Army's main electronic \nwarfare unit, allowing Y Troop to go back to longer-range inter\u00ad\ncept work. At this point a small Iraqi patrol found them, and \nmanaged to launch some RPG rockets at their encampment \nbefore being seen off with a barrage of automatic fire. There \nwere no casualties, but it was a sharp reminder of the hazards \nof forward interception. Thereafter, the number of targets they \nwere tracking became progressively smaller as Iraqi soldiers \ndeserted their positions. A notable discovery was the location \nof their counterparts, the Iraqi 124 Electronic Warfare Regiment. \nIt was noted with satisfaction that this became '124 Crater \nRegiment' after the application of well-directed artillery fire.52 \nAs the British First Armoured Division advanced towards \nBasra, sigint provided timely warnings of ambushes that had \nbeen set up by Saddam's Fedayeen guerrillas. It also obtained \ngood information on the movements of key Iraqi leaders inside \nBasra itself. 53 Sigint performed well in Iraq because many of the \nold problems of intelligence support to the front-line soldier had \nbeen solved. For the first time in perhaps fifty years, sigint \nflowed freely from national assets down to operational units, a \nstunning breakthrough when set against the history of patchy \n526 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nGCHQ support for previous major campaigns. Instead, the \nproblem was sharing between allies. The Americans were well\u00ad\nequipped with pilotless drones that collected both imagery and \nsigint, of which the British felt the lack. As the initial invasion \nturned into a gruelling insurgency there was also a shortage of \npersonnel who were experienced in running human agents. \nSome British sigint was being fed into American databases which \nthen proved to be 'for American eyes only', causing frustration \nat the front line. There was no sharing of sigint with minor \nallies. In fairness to British and American intelligence agencies, \nwhile they had performed poorly on the issue of Iraqi WMD, \nthey had accurately predicted the difficulties of a hostile occu\u00ad\npation and the prolonged insurgency. 54 \nAs the Iraq War commenced, GCHQ's Director, Sir Francis \nRichards, was preparing to depart to become Governor of \nGibraltar. After a succession of three 'outsiders' as Director, \nGCHQ was being handed back to one of its own, the fifty-five\u00ad\nyear-old Dr David Pepper. Joining GCHQ in 1972 after \ncompleting a D.Phil. in physics at Oxford University, he had \nrisen to be Director of Administration by 1995, and served as \n'aide de camp' during the Roger Hurn review.55 Pepper not only \nhad a new role, he also had a brand-new office, located behind \nthe gleaming glass doors of 'the Doughnut', GCHQ's impressive \nnew headquarters at Benhall. The first wave of staff was \npreparing to move in during August 2003, and senior officials \nassured reporters that even the builders had gone through secur\u00ad\nity checks: 'We didn't want a repeat of the American Embassy \nin Moscow, which was riddled with bugs.' The building was \nsecure, but unfortunately it was not big enough. Planned during \nthe 1990s contraction of intelligence, it was now too small to \nhold all of the GCHQ staff, which with the surge against terrorism \nwas now approaching 5,300. About five hundred of these could \nnot be permanently accommodated, so some buildings were \nretained on the old Oakley site, and 'hot desking' was the order \nof the day. 56 \nTHE 9/11 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 527 \n'The Doughnut' had proved to be surprisingly troublesome. \nIn late 1999 there had been dire warnings about a massive over\u00ad\nspend on its computer equipment, and as a result the Cabinet \nSecretary, Richard Wilson, had asked Lieutenant General Sir \nEdmund Burton to review every aspect of GCHQ's business \nmanagement. 57 Burton had some good ideas, but he could not \nfix the IT overspend which had triggered the review. When \nGCHQ planned its new building in the late 1990s, its techni\u00ad\ncians were still mentally living in the late 1 980s. As David Pepper \nlater explained, at that time its computers tended to be stand\u00ad\nalone systems, often quite large, but not interconnected. This \nreflected the fact that GCHQ's main adversaries were also 'large, \nmonolithic, essentially static targets' like Russia. By the mid-\n1990s the organisation was faced with much more volatile \ntargets, requiring flexible approaches, and this accelerated \nGCHQ's move towards computer networking. Yet the planners \nstill envisaged a simple box-move into the new building, which \nmeant switching everything off. Nobody stood back and said, \n'Just a minute. It's not going to work like that, because of the \ndegree of networking.'58 \nGCHQ's original guess at the cost of moving its computers \nhad been \u00a341 million over two years. It was now a breathtaking \n\u00a3450 million. 59 Parliament was incensed, and MPs were doubly \nangry because this kind of mistake had happened many times \nbefore. The computer costs of the new MIS and SIS buildings \nhad also rocketed. There were other precedents. The most \nobvious was a secret defence programme called 'Project Pindar', \na top-level command bunker hidden under the southern end \nof the Ministry of Defence main building.60 This vast complex \nalso included facilities for 'Cobra', the Cabinet emergency \ncommittee room.61 Although partly a civil project, the costs were \nburied within the Ministry of Defence budget.62 The agreed cost \neventually quadrupled, and much of this had to do with the \ncomputers and communications equipment. There had been a \nsimilar experience with a disastrous Defence Intelligence Staff \ncomputer scheme called 'Trawlerman', which had to be aban-\n528 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \ndoned. In 1996, MIS's computerised system code-named 'Grant' \nhad also failed miserably, and was scrapped at a total cost of \nover \u00a320 million.63 Indeed, there were so many precedents that \nMPs could not begin to understand why officials had not learned \nfrom this string of disasters.64 \nGCHQ's mammoth overspend caused real friction within the \nintelligence community, since MIS and SIS feared that their \nbudgets would be squeezed to make up the COSt.65 In the event, \nDavid Pepper was saved by circumstances, since the increased \ntempo of counter-terrorist activity made the case for uninter\u00ad\nrupted operations unanswerable. Nevertheless, in the autumn \nof 2003 Parliament discovered that GCHQ had wasted further \nmillions on new systems that had been bought to intercept \nterrorist communications. A costly prototype of a system that \nGCHQ hoped would increase its ability to listen in to terrorist \ntraffic had only 'partly delivered' .66 This was coded Whitehall \nlanguage for 'The computer system has failed and has been \nscrapped.' MPs complained that 'Security cannot be used as a \nsmokescreen for incompetence.'67 Notwithstanding this, it has \nto be conceded that operational continuity at GCHQ had proved \nvaluable in the recent past. On 24 January 2000 a catastrophic \nfailure of NSA's powerful computers halted the processing of \nAmerican intelligence at Fort Meade in Maryland for more than \nthree days. GCHQ took up some of the strain, and American \ncustomers were served directly from Cheltenham.68 \nBy the summer of 2003, no one was taking much notice of \nGCHQ's financial misdemeanours. Instead, the hot intelligence \nissue was the 'missing' Iraqi WMD, which had been the main \njustification for going to war. Four months after the invasion, \nno WMD had been found. The decision to invade Iraq had been \npolitically divisive, and the patience of the British public had \nrun out. There followed an unprecedented 'season of inquiry' \ninto the secret services, with no fewer than four British inves\u00ad\ntigations into intelligence aspects of Iraqi WMD between July \n2003 and July 2004. The issues were looked at by the \nTHE 9111 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 529 \nParliamentary Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, and then \nby the Intelligence and Security Committee. A third inquiry, \nchaired by Lord Hutton, looked into the death of Dr David Kelly, \na government scientist who had been a key defence intelligence \nexpert, and who was closely cross-examined during the first \ninquiry. None of this assuaged the intense public anger, so finally, \nin early 2004, Lord Butler, who had been Cabinet Secretary \nunder John Major, was called in to conduct a much wider inves\u00ad\ntigation into British intelligence and WMD over the previous \ndecade. \nThe controversy persuaded veteran Cheltenham staff to break \ntheir customary silence. In a letter to The Times in February \n2004, Douglas Nicoll, the senior GCHQ officer who had previ\u00ad\nously reviewed the JIe's performance on attack warning, \ndenounced Tony Blair's recent explanations before Parliament \nabout how the JIC had interacted with other parts of the intel\u00ad\nligence machine over Iraq as having 'the highest degree of \nimprobability', and asserted that 'politicos' from No.10 had \nbecome involved in rhe intelligence process. Nicoll considered \nthat this was 'unprecedented', and that there was much for \nLord Butler to investigate.69 \nEveryone was asking the same question. Was the Iraqi WMD \nfiasco a product of intelligence failure by the agencies, or of \ndeception by politicians and spin doctors? Inevitably, the answer \nis 'both'. Having badly underestimated Iraqi WMD stocks prior \nto the First Gulf War in 1991, intelligence officers did not want \nto be caught out a second time, and so opted for 'worst-case \nanalysis'. In other words, they over-corrected. Moreover, the \nallies cooperated so closely on WMD estimates that, far from \nchallenging each other's findings, they succumbed to a form of \n'groupthink'. Only the Dutch and Canadian intelligence commu\u00ad\nnities expressed serious doubts. Butler revealed that a lot of \nBritish intelligence had come from a handful of human agents \nrun by SIS who were not properly 'validated', and whose mat\u00ad\nerial was mediocre at best.70 The awkward evidence still \ncontinues to accumulate. Tyler Drumheller, the CIA Europe \n530 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nDivision Chief, who worked closely with Britain's SIS, has \nrevealed that Naji Sabri, Iraq's Foreign Minister, did a deal to \nreveal the country's military secrets. Drumheller recounts that \nonce policy-makers learned what Sabri had to say -that Iraq \nhad no active WMD programme -'They stopped being inter\u00ad\nested in the intelligence.'71 \nThere was also blatant political dishonesty. The British govern\u00ad\nment had made three assertions in its WMD dossier. First, that \nthere was plausible intelligence to suggest that the Iraqis might \nhave hidden some old biological or chemical stocks from 1991. \nThis was true, but these weapons were unlikely to be usable, \nand were at best of historical interest. Second, that there was \nevidence that Iraq continued to seek nuclear components on \nthe world market, and nurtured future ambitions. This was also \ntrue, but no one thought for a moment that the country had \ngot far with reconstituting its nuclear programme. Everything \nturned on the third claim, that Iraq was engaged in continued \nproduction of WMD. This assertion was made forcibly by the \nPrime Minister in his personal foreword to the Iraqi WMD dossier \nin September 2002. There was no credible evidence for this.72 \nLater, Blair assured the House of Commons that the intelligence \nwas 'extensive, detailed, authoritative'. This statement was also \ndeeply misleading.73 Equally, Butler noticed that there was no \nchange in the intelligence reports on Iraqi WMD during the \nperiod between 2002 and 2003, when the British government \nshifted dramatically from a policy of containing Iraq to one of \nconfrontation.74 Alastair Campbell summed this up best in his \ndiary, noting that the hardest question was: 'Why now? What \nwas it that we knew now that we didn't before that made us \nbelieve that we had to do it now?'75 \nIn one respect, Lord Butler's report was odd. As we have \nseen, GCHQ produces the majority of Britain's intelligence. \nAstonishingly, in the 216 pages of the report 'GCHQ' appears \nonly once, and that is in the list of abbreviations. It seems that \nCheltenham was referred to in the text of an earlier draft, but \nin the published version all discussion of it has mysteriously \nTHE 9111 ATTACKS AND THE IRAQ WAR 531 \ndisappeared. In fact Peter Freeman, a veteran GCHQ officer who \nserved as the link between Cheltenham and the inquiry team, \npersuaded Butler to remove all direct references to GCHQ from \nthe report.76 The Butler inquiry is also an example of the masterly \ndrawing of remits. Although it was not permitted to look at the \nlink between intelligence and policy-making over Iraq, which \nis what everyone wanted to know about, curiously, it was \nallowed to make meandering historical digressions into intelli\u00ad\ngence on other WMD episodes as far back as 1990. These \nincluded work against the AQ Khan proliferation network in \nPakistan and the winding up of President Gaddafi's nuclear \nprogramme in Libya. The case studies were selective: Butler \nwent far enough back to find some successes, but not far enough \nto find other failures.77 \nButler's inquiry into British intelligence, and parallel inquiries \nin the United States, underlined the strange new climate the \nintelligence agencies were working in. Although not exactly \ntransparent, they were under the spotlight of investigation as \nnever before. Trust in them had been badly corroded, and many \nthought it would take a decade to repair the damage. \nInternational teams of journalists, aided by dissident officials, \nwere ripping the lid off each sensitive story in short order. \nMoreover, the British public was now highly suspicious about \nthe increasing levels of surveillance at home and abroad. Yet \nsimultaneously, the upsurge in international terrorism had led \ngovernments to call for a massive increase in secret intelligence \nactivity of every kind. Understandably, no politicians wanted \nanother 9111 to happen on their watch. The balance between \nliberty and security was already a hot issue, and during 2005 \nit would become even hotter.78 \n26 \nFrom Bletchley Park to a \nBrave New World? \nThese new proposals suggest an intention to capture anything and \neverything ... \nUK internet service providers commenting on \ngovernment plans, August 2009' \nAt 8.50 on the morning of Thursday, 7 July 2005, four suicide \nbombers attacked London. Following the classic al Qaeda \napproach of multiple strikes, they bombed three tube trains \nwithin the space of a minute, and an hour later attacked a bus \nin Tavistock Square. Fifty-two people died and over seven \nhundred were injured in what proved to be the most deadly \nattack on the capital since the Second World War. Tony Blair \nwas away at the G-8 Summit at Gleneagles in Scotland, as \nindeed were numerous specialist police units from London, sent \nthere to guard the visiting world leaders from marauding anti\u00ad\nglobalisation protesters. In the immediate wake of the attacks, \nGeorge Bush and Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi argued \nover whether the G-8 leaders should come to London to show \nsolidarity. In the end, Blair left his international guests in \nScotland and flew back to London to join his Cabinet colleagues \nin the increasingly familiar surroundings of 'Cobra', deep \nbeneath Whitehall. Two weeks later, another wave of bombers \nattempted a second attack, but failed due to technical problems \nwith their explosive devices. What most shocked the British \npopulation was that these were suicide attacks by their own \nnationals.2 Dr David Pepper, Director of GCHQ, observed that \n'What happened in July [2005] was a demonstration that there \nwere conspiracies going on about which we essentially knew \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 533 \nnothing.' The British government now had to rethink its surveil\u00ad\nlance strategy. 3 \nGCHQ was now fighting on three fronts. It was taking a \nleading role in the so-called 'War on Terror' while supporting \nBritish forces in two major conflicts, in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nIn the context of the prolonged insurgencies that had devel\u00ad\noped in both countries, the new idea was the 'Total Information \nBattlespace' that sought to connect strategic intelligence\u00ad\ngathering from satellites, and every other kind of source, with \nsoldiers on the ground. The old idea that GCHQ would mostly \nsupport the 'high-ups' in Whitehall while the troops fended for \nthemselves with their own tactical sigint collection or 'Y units' \nin ageing Land Rovers had been completely abandoned. The \nchallenge was to bring together sigint from many sources, and \nindeed from many intelligence services, since both campaigns \ninvolved numerous national contingents from places as diverse \nas Spain, Denmark and Ukraine. Sigint connectivity with the \nAmericans was still a difficult issue. British, Australian and \nCanadian special forces, which were never shy when it came \nto speaking their minds, asserted that this problem had cost \nallied lives in the early part of the campaign in Afghanistan. \nAlmost no sigint was shared with the Iraqi or Afghan forces, \ndespite the efforts to rebuild them. \nOne of the most effective allied sigint operations was run by \na Dutch intelligence chief who belonged to NATO's International \nSecurity Assistance Force (ISAF) around Kabul. General Joop \nvan der Reijn spent the months before his departure to \nAfghanistan joining up the intelligence practices of the Dutch \nand German forces. Once he had arrived, one of his most valu\u00ad\nable innovations was improvised local sigint. He took over a \nbuilding and filled it with low-cost 'off the shelf' radio inter\u00ad\ncept equipment that was commercially available. Two dozen \nformer Afghan policemen were selected to become translators \nand eventually sigint monitors. Any problems with the rudi\u00ad\nmentary equipment were more than offset by the ability of this \nunit to comprehend the innumerable dialects and opaque infer-\n534 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nences in the Taliban conversations they intercepted. This unit \ntook a little time to set up 'given the Afghan way of doing busi\u00ad\nness', but eventually it became an invaluable part of the Joint \nSecurity Coordination Centre, which was ISAFs intelligence \nhub.4 \nOn the ground, much of the British sigint work in Afghanistan \nand Iraq was conducted by Light Electronic Warfare Teams, or \nLEWTs, from Britain's last remaining dedicated field sigint unit, \n14 Signals Regiment.5 Although it deployed the same vehicle\u00ad\nmounted equipment that had been effective in Yugoslavia, \nnamely the Odette sigint system and the Vampire direction\u00ad\nfinding system, much of the important work was done on foot \nat dangerously close range. The main instrument of the sigint \nwar in Afghanistan was 'Scarus', a portable interception kit \noperated by four-man teams which looked rather like a back\u00ad\npack radio with oversized aerials. This was introduced in the \nsummer of 2003, and by 2004 a dozen units were operational. \nThe range of Scarus is only ten miles, and this meant forward \nmonitoring operations. Scarus was often supplemented by \ncommercially purchased hand-held scanners of the sort used by \naircraft enthusiasts to listen in to air traffic control towers. Again \nthis was improvised sigint, since these could be used most effec\u00ad\ntively by Afghan guides accompanying infantry patrols.6 \nBritish sigint operators often worked with their NATO \ncolleagues. In 2006 they teamed up with Danish electronic \nwarfare operators in Afghanistan'S Helmand province under the \nSigintiEW Operations Centre in Regional Command (South). \nTheir work earned them praise as 'battle-winners', providing \nreal-time force protection and situational awareness. Many of \nthe senior army commanders were experiencing the enormous \npotential of sigint for the first time. Intense operational pres\u00ad\nsure led to experimentation. The most remarkable achievement \nwas linking up sigint aircraft circling overhead to the four-man \nLEWTs embedded with Parachute Regiment companies, and also \nserving the platoon-sized long-range patrols. \nHowever, the cost was high. LEWT troops lost four men in \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 535 \naction in the period up to January 2008.7 Among those killed \nwas Lance Corporal Jabron Hashmi, the first British Muslim \nsoldier to be killed on active duty in Afghanistan. He died along \nwith another sigint specialist, Corporal Peter Thorpe, when they \nwere hit by a rocket-propelled grenade during a firefight near \nSangin. Born in Pakistan, less than an hour from the border \nwith Afghanistan, Hashmi had come to Britain with his family \nwhen he was aged twelve. He had joined the Army and under\u00ad\ngone specialist training at the Defence Intelligence and Security \nCentre at Chicksands before being posted to the Army's main \nsigint unit. The local Parachute Regiment commanders spoke \nof the vital protection his specialist work had provided to their \npatrols.8 GCHQ also sent significant numbers of people out to \nIraq and Afghanistan: managers were surprised by the willing\u00ad\nness of staff from Cheltenham to volunteer for these very \narduous postings.9 \nThe Royal Marines were prominent in the Afghanistan \ncampaign, and had their own dedicated tactical sigint unit, in \nthe form of Y Squadron from 3 Commando Brigade. Again the \nemphasis was on a front-line approach, with mobile Radio \nReconnaissance Teams accompanying patrols. In May 2007 the \nRoyal Marines located and eventually killed the Taliban's most \nimportant chief, Mullah Dadullah, in an operation that was \ndriven by sigint. He had been tracked across Helmand province \nby intercepting the calls he made to his brother on a satellite \nphone.lO By January 2009, commanders boasted of six thou\u00ad\nsand significant intercepts and in the region of seven hundred \nenemy call signs identified. The most significant contribution \nwas advance warnings of enemy ambushes in Helmand which \nsaved many lives. Once patrols understood what Y Squadron's \ncapabilities were, they wanted to take a Radio Reconnaissance \nTeam with them every time they went out on patrol. Fusing \nsigint from tactical, operational and even strategic platforms was \nthe new style of intelligence operations. The main vehicle for \nthis was the recently formed in-theatre Sigint Electronic Warfare \nOperation Centre. Experiences in Afghanistan after 2002 led to \n536 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \na new overall sigint approach for NATO, tried out first in \nOperation 'Trail Hammer' in 2006. The objective was to share \nsigint seamlessly between GCHQ, the Nimrods of 51 Squadron, \nships with dedicated sigint collection suites like HMS Cornwall, \nand forward sigint collectors. A high priority is extending this \nsort of support to units like the SAS.ll \nCircling overhead in Afghanistan were Nimrod Rl recon\u00ad\nnaissance aircraft. Although the Rl sigint variants of these planes \noperate regularly over Afghanistan, the majority of Nimrods \nused there were maritime reconnaissance aircraft, originally \ndesigned to search for submarines. Given that Afghanistan is \nwithout benefit of a coastline, or even large stretches of water, \nthis may seem peculiar. Their presence was required because \nuntil 20lO, Britain lacked effective unmanned reconnaissance \naircraft, or 'drones', of the sort operated by the Americans, since \nthe type of drone initially purchased by the British, called \n'Phoenix', was much inferior, and would not fly in hot weather \nor at the altitudes required for operations in Afghanistan.12 \nIndeed, when deployed in Iraq in 2003, one drone had been \nlost for every six missions flown. As a result, the ageing fleet \nof Nimrod maritime reconnaissance aircraft, six of which had \nsome real-time video surveillance capability, was stretched to \nthe limit serving as temporary drones and sigint collectors. One \nof these planes suffered a calamitous explosion in September \n2006, with the loss of sixteen lives. In-flight refuelling of Nimrods \nwas halted for a period, and then they were all grounded, leaving \ntroops dangerously exposed.13 \nBelatedly, the British purchased larger and more effective \nforeign-made drones. The most important model was the \nWatchkeeper 450, which had an impressive ability to listen in \nto Taliban communications. This was an Israeli-made device that \nhad been used extensively to conduct missile attacks over \nLebanon in 2006, and later over Gaza. For the British, the \nWatchkeeper provided much-needed video coverage and also \ngreatly improved sigint, since at altitude, interception range is \nmuch better. Currently, the elderly Odette intercept system is \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 537 \nbeing replaced with 'Soothsayer', which offers greater inter\u00ad\noperability with the Americans and a much higher level of \nautomation. Significant investment in front-line sigint equip\u00ad\nment to serve the troops is, at last, being made. \nWhile circling over Afghanistan, the RAP's Nimrod R 1 s noticed \nsomething rather interesting. From 2005, it was increasingly \ncommon for these surveillance planes monitoring Taliban radio \ncommunications to come across militants speaking with Bradford \nor Birmingham accents. A case in point was Rashid Rauf, a \nBirmingham man sought by British police in connection with \nan August 2006 plot to bomb transatlantic airliners. He is \nbelieved to have escaped from a Pakistan prison in 2007, and \nwas killed just inside Pakistan in a CIA missile attack on a mili\u00ad\ntant stronghold in 2008. Intelligence officers observed privately: \n'He's not the only British Muslim to die out here: Predictably, \nthis raised fears that experienced fighters might have returned \nhome from Afghanistan to plot attacks in Britain, and it was \nnot long before RAF aircraft with similar listening equipment \nbegan circling over British cities searching for returned Afghan \nfighters. Their brief was to seek out suspects using 'voice prints' \nof fighters with British accents that had been collected by the \nNimrods from Taliban battlefield communications.14 \nThe surveillance effort between the war in Afghanistan and \nthe 'war' at home was now seamlessly connected. The RAF had \npurchased three Britten-Norman Islander aircraft which were \nequipped with sigint suites and used as airborne listening stations. \nBased at RAF Northolt in west London, they are used for covert \nsurveillance by MIS, which provides the monitoring staff in the \naircraft. In early 2007 they were used to support the West \nMidlands Police when tracking suspects connected to a plot to \nkidnap and behead a British Muslim soldier. These aircraft can \nfly at fairly high altitude, and have been seen loitering over the \nEast End of London for long periods. They are also known to \noperate out of Leeds-Bradford Airport. Many have presumed \nthat they were deployed as part of a post-91 11 surveillance effort, \nbut newspapers have published photographs of an MIS officer \n538 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nstanding next to one of them as long ago as 1999,1S Although \nrun jointly by the RAP and MI5, like other 'Home Office' inter\u00ad\nception projects, this is partly a GCHQ activity, using technicians \non temporary loan to the Home Office. It recalls Peter Wright's \n'Airborne Rafter' programme in the late 1950s, again run jointly \nby MI5 and GCHQ, which searched for KGB spies by tracking \ntheir radios.16 The residents in Muslim areas of Birmingham, \nBradford, Leeds and London are not necessarily aware of the \nsigint flights, but they are highly sensitised to surveillance. 'You \nare always looking over your shoulder here,' remarked one local \n-even council workmen digging a hole in the road 'means MI5, \nGCHQ, and the installation of monitoring devices' Y \nThese British monitoring aircraft use a technology that was \ndeveloped during the drug wars in Colombia in the early 1990s, \nwhen the sigint agencies were involved in a technical war against \nwell-resourced cocaine cartels. Once Pablo Escobar, the head of \nthe Medellin drugs cartel, had been killed in December 1993, \nother drug lords became more anxious about the vulnerability \nof their cell phones. Their response was to frequently change \ntheir phones to confuse the eavesdroppers. Remarkably, they \ncould even make use of scanners to steal the identities of the \nphones of passers-by, which were then cloned. The answer was \na new aerial technology which depended on small spy planes. \nCessnas and other light aircraft were fitted with directional \nantennae and wide-band recorders to take all the traffic from \nacross the major bands on the entire spectrum used by cell phones. \nA single aircraft could take much of the mobile phone traffic of \nan entire city by circling at a high altitude and sucking up the \nmicrowave signals that connect the cell sites to the phone \nnetworks. The plane then pushed the product to a ground station \nwhere a massive computer examined the audio content of each \nconversation using voice-recognition software. This technique has \nnot been effective everywhere, since some regions do not have \nmuch in the way of cell phone systems. However, in the skies \nover Britain this is now an important element in the armoury \nof the intelligence agencies.18 \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 539 \nComparing voices recorded over Britain with voices recorded \nover Afghanistan underlined the fact that the boundary between \nforeign wars and domestic terrorism was now perilously thin. \nIn 2006 GCHQ launched two new programmes subsumed under \nthe broader 'SIGMod initiative', or sigint modernisation \nprogramme. The exact nature of this remains classified, but it \nclearly focuses on the way in which GCHQ collects, analyses, \npresents and disseminates intelligence about terrorism. The \nanxiety that Britain's oversight body, the Intelligence and \nSecurity Committee, has expressed about the need 'to ensure \nthat new interception techniques are regulated by a proper legal \nframework' is another indication that the boundary between \ndomestic and foreign communications is rapidly collapsing.19 \nSIGMod has resulted in a twentyfold increase in GCHQ's ability \nto access, process and store material from internet-based commu\u00ad\nnications, and 'vast sums of money' were spent on these two \nprojects. Meanwhile, GCHQ decided to deploy yet more analysts \nto work alongside MI5 and other partners engaged in counter\u00ad\nterrorism.20 \nWhat was GCHQ's own reading of its growing place in what \nhad proved to be an American -led 'War on Terror'? Detecting \nthe broader political sensibilities of an entire secret service is \nnot easy. However, by early 2006 there was a steady rise in staff \nasking difficult questions about legality, set against the back\u00ad\nground of high-profile issues such as CIA secret prisons in Europe \nthat were spilling onto the front pages of Britain's newspapers. \nInquiries by the Council of Europe and the European Parliament \ninto this matter prompted the Intelligence and Security \nCommittee to look at British involvement in what were often \ncalled 'extraordinary renditions', in other words the secret appre\u00ad\nhension and transfer of terrorist suspects without warrant. The \nheads of MI5, SIS and GCHQ were all asked for their views. \nWhen questioned, Sir David Pepper, GCHQ's Director, seemed \nespecially anxious to distance his organisation from the affair. \nOn 29 November 2006 he explained that GCHQ had 'never \n540 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nknowingly provided support to a US rendition operation and \nwe would not authorise the use of intelligence for that purpose \n... and we have never been asked to do SO'. He added that \nGCHQ's only knowledge of the rendition programme 'has essen\u00ad\ntially flowed from what SIS have learnt and told the other \nAgencies'. On rendition, he insisted, GCHQ had no independent \nsource of information, and had merely 'followed SIS's growing \nunderstanding of what the U.S. was doing'. Pepper then outlined \nthe standard guidance given to GCHQ's analysts for situations \nin which they fear that unlawful behaviour might result from \nsupplying intelligt'nce to a foreign partner. This included possible \nupward referral, 'ultimately to Ministerial level'. One gets a \nstrong sense that not all aspects of the 'War on Terror' have sat \ncomfortably with GCHQ's management board.21 \nThe stormiest current issues for GCHQ have little to do with \nthe United States. Instead they have everything to do with the \ntroubled business of domestic interception. While the British \ngovernment tends to present GCHQ as a foreign intelligence \nservice like SIS, mainly concerned with the interception of \nforeign communications, as we have seen, the distinction \nbetween foreign and domestic is eroding fast. The claim that all \ndomestic interception is now authorised by individual warrants \nrequires an increasingly ingenious interpretation of the law, and \nthere is considerable evidence of wholesale collection of commu\u00ad\nnications. Indeed, several new developments mean that GCHQ \nhas little choice but to head down the road towards wholesale \ncollection, since many international groups such as terrorists \nand criminal gangs overlap seamlessly, with dispersed elements \nwithin British society.22 \nThe issue of what is a domestic communication and what is \nforeign has been further muddied by Britain's membership of \nthe European Union. In recent years Britain has been attempting \nto persuade Europe to take on some of the odious burden of \nlegislating for electronic surveillance of its own population. \nBritish Ministers wanted Europe to pass legislation that would \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 541 \nrequire mobile phone companies and internet service providers \nto retain vast amounts of records relating to personal emails, \ndetails of web pages accessed and telephone calls for ten years, \nand for these to be made accessible to the police and intelli\u00ad\ngence services on request. The proposals were denounced by \nprivacy campaigners as among the most wide-ranging exten\u00ad\nsions of government security surveillance over private individ\u00ad\nuals.23 Their main opponent was the internet industry itself, \nwhich resisted them vehemently, again stressing issues of privacy. \nIn reality, its anxieties reflected pressure from business \ncustomers, since the authorities have a track record of being \ncavalier with personal data. They also reflect concerns about \nthe high cost of storing data including the names and addresses \nof customers, the source and destination of their emails, web sites \nvisited and phone numbers called. All of this would be freely \navailable to the authorities, since only access to the actual \ncontent of emails and telephone calls would require a warrant. \nGCHQ continually pressed for this, and in 2006 it finally passed \ninto European law.24 \nGCHQ has also constituted a powerful but hidden voice in \nthe debate over the proposed use of telephone intercepts in \ncourt. The British police and customs would like to see this \nlegalised, but Cheltenham is adamantly opposed, arguing that \nit would sensitise GCHQ targets to the fact that they were vulner\u00ad\nable to surveillance. This is an element of the age-old tension \nbetween secret knowledge and the active use of secret knowl\u00ad\nedge, which has bedevilled sigint since its inception. Since 2001, \nseveral Home Secretaries have pressed for a review of the law, \nand have questioned why intercepted telephone conversations \ncan only serve in court as 'intelligence', with their existence \nconcealed from the defence. In 2004, Cabinet Ministers were \npresented with an inter-agency study entitled 'Review of \nIntercept as Evidence', the fifth occasion in ten years on which \nthis matter had been debated. In 2005, limited use of intercepts \nas evidence appeared about to be approved when GCHQ inter\u00ad\nvened at the last minute, citing new technical developments \n542 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nand, remarkably, exercising a veto.25 There are strange anom\u00ad\nalies in the law as it stands. A conversation collected by a radio \nmicrophone bug is admissible in court, but telephone intercepts \nare not. Moreover, telephone intercepts collected in other coun\u00ad\ntries are admissible in British courts: when a former Merseyside \nnarcotics squad chief was convicted over his corrupt relation\u00ad\nship with a drugs baron, the prosecution depended on wiretap \nevidence from Holland.26 Rather sniffily, GCHQ explained that \nintercept evidence from other European countries can be used \nfreely because Britain 'is the only country which has ... a \nstrategic intercept and SIGINT capacity that is worth \nprotecting'.27 \nGCHQ's bizarre policy on phone-tap evidence is highlighted \nby American attempts to extradite the radical Muslim cleric Abu \nHamza aI-Masri (known to the British tabloid press as 'Hooky') \non terrorist charges. Cheltenham had allegedly intercepted tele\u00ad\nphone discussions between Abu Hamza and a group that had \nkidnapped Western tourists in Yemen. Secret recordings of these \nconversations were made in December 1998 by experts from \nGCHQ who listened in on a specially purchased satellite phone. \nThe transcripts were passed to MIS and Special Branch in early \n1999. This material cannot be used in British courts. However, \nalmost identical material collected by NSA is likely to be central \nto any case against Abu Hamza mounted by the Americans. The \nBritish authorities are reportedly highly embarrassed that they \nhave been shown to have evidence suggestive of persons \ninvolved in kidnapping and murder, yet did not take stronger \naction.28 In March 2009 the use of telephone intercept evidence \nwas revisited for the sixth time in a decade, and it is now tech\u00ad\nnically permitted, but is subject to so many conditions -including \na GCHQ veto -that experts believe that in practice it will never \nbe used in court. lain Lobban, the current Director of GCHQ, \nhas continued to assert that its use would represent 'a very, \nvery serious blow back to our capability'.29 \nEach time the use of intercept evidence in court has been \nsuggested, it has been supported by the Prime Minister and the \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 543 \nHome Secretary. The current Director of Public Prosecutions, \nKeir Starmer, and his predecessor, Ken Macdonald, are also in \nfavour, and recently blamed 'the spying agencies' for the lack \nof progress. The ability of GCHQ to block the proposal is testi\u00ad\nmony to its considerable secret power within Whitehall and \nWestminster. Quite apart from the issue of secrecy, GCHQ does \nnot wish to be drawn into the time-consuming business of \npreparing evidence for court proceedings. However, intercepts \nwould resolve many difficult cases, including some of those \nrelating to people currently held under what is effectively house \narrest by means of controversial Control Orders. Many believe \nthat the intercepts that supported these Control Orders would \nalso have facilitated effective prosecutions. 3D \nIn 2008 the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith unveiled a new \ndomestic intercept plan of truly breathtaking proportions when \nshe announced the remarkable Intercept Modernisation \nProgramme, or 'IMP'. Costing an estimated \u00a312 billion pounds, \nthis project dwarfed even the massive Cheltenham 'Doughnut', \nand amounted to a surveillance concept so vast that it was \nbeyond the bounds of the imagination. Given that intelligence\u00ad\nrelated IT projects have routinely run over budget by several \ntimes their agreed cost, it is hardly surprising that the Treasury \nsqueaked with fear at the very mention of such an idea. The \noddest feature of the IMP was that, despite the fact that Europe \nhad finally agreed to compel internet service providers to retain \nall of their customers' communications data within their own \ncompanies, the plan was to build a vast government-run silo \nto duplicate exactly the same function, recording and storing \nthe details of every telephone call, email, text message and \ninstance of web access by every person in Britain. The scheme \nwas initially associated with the innocuously titled \nCommunications Data Bill scheduled for 2009. Its stated purpose \nwas bland -to 'allow communications data capabilities for the \nprevention and detection of crime and protection of national \nsecurity to keep up with changing technology'. However, Lord \nCarlile of Berriew QC, Britain's independent reviewer of anti-\n544 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nterrorist legislation, immediately expressed anxiety about the \nnew government-run database: 'As a raw idea it is awful.' He \nadded that it would lead to the authorities undertaking searches \n'willy-nilly' and without review. Richard Thomas, the \nInformation Commissioner, also denounced the IMP plans as 'a \nstep too far', and entirely contrary to the British way of life.3l \nIn late 2008, growing public hostility to IMP prompted the \ngovernment to withdraw the Bill at the last minute. Instead, it \nhas resolved to advance the plan by stealth. Remarkably, and \nwithout any legislation, a pilot scheme at an estimated cost of \n\u00a32 billion is already under way, with sample 'probes' established \nat the facilities of one major fixed line telecom operator and \none major mobile phone provider. The Home Office Minister, \nLord West, has emphasised the important place of the private \nsector in this scheme. One alleged beneficiary is the security \ncompany Detica, which was bought in 2008 by BAE Systems \nLtd. Located in Guildford, it manufactures the strange black \nboxes -which enjoy the unlikely title of 'deep packet sniffers' \n-that enable intelligence services to siphon off material from \nthe internet. Unlike the current black boxes that vacuum up \ncontent, the IMP would be a vast database of 'who contacted \nwho' and 'who looked at what'. By analysing a person's social \nnetwork as defined by their telephone calls, texts and emails, \nand then overlaying their internet use or combining it with \ntheir credit-card activity, an enormously detailed picture can be \nconstructed of every individual and those they associate with.32 \nThe British government has always insisted that IMP is merely \nabout maintaining an existing and traditional capability to carry \nout interception in a world of rapidly changing technology. \nHowever, the reality looks rather different. In April 2009 the \ngovernment advertised for senior staff to direct an ambitious \nprogramme called 'Mastering the Internet'. With a title that \nmight well have been borrowed from an episode of Doctor Who, \nthis initiative could have been deliberately calculated to provoke \nanxiety on the part of privacy campaigners. Indeed, there was \nso much controversy in the press that, unusually, in May 2009 \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 545 \nGCHQ had to issue an express denial. It stated: 'GCHQ is not \ndeveloping technology to enable the monitoring of all internet \nuse and phone calls in Britain, or to target everyone in the UK: \nGCHQ's argument is that the nature of telephone calls is \nchanging, and they are increasingly passed over the internet. \nWithout this new programme it will lose the intercept capa\u00ad\nbility it has always had. However, this glosses over the fact that \nbecause it is difficult to separate out telephone calls from other \nkinds of internet traffic, and equally difficult to separate out \nrecords of who called who from actual call content, this moderni\u00ad\nsation unavoidably means a vast increase in collection.33 \nIn August 2009, GCBQ's denial that it had ambitions for \nmassive surveillance met a direct challenge when Britain's own \ntelecommunications firms and internet service providers, \nincluding British Telecom and Virgin, condemned the IMP plan \nas an unwarranted intrusion into people's privacy. The very \ncompanies that the British government was depending upon to \nhelp it to implement the scheme asserted strongly that govern\u00ad\nment officials were not being straight with the public about the \nvast scale of monitoring they were planning. Their statement \ntold the government that: \n* We view the description of the government's proposals as \n'maintaining' the capability as disingenuous: the volume of \ndata the government now proposes [we] should collect and \nretain will be unprecedented, as is the overall level of intru\u00ad\nsion into the privacy of citizenry ... This is a purely polit\u00ad\nical description that serves to win consent by hiding the \nextent of the proposed extension of powers for the state. \n* The companies also boggled at the mammoth scale of the private \ninformation they were being asked to retain on the telephone \nand internet use of British citizens: they complained that they \ndid not even know of any equipment that would enable them \nto acquire and retain such a wide range of data.34 \nWhat does government want with all this detail? Even more \n546 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \npuzzling is the fact that it is prepared to spend vast amounts \nof money to store this data itself, when it has already compelled \nthe telecom companies and internet service providers to hold \nthe same information. The answer is 'data-mining', the use of \ncomputers to comb through unimaginable amounts of infor\u00ad\nmation looking for patterns and statistical relationships. This \npractice now constitutes the most insidious threat to personal \nliberty. What makes surveillance different in the age of ubiqui\u00ad\ntous computing and the mobile phone is that our data is \nnever thrown away. Machines routinely store millions of details \nabout our everyday lives, and at some point in the future it \nwill be possible to bring these all together and search them. \nDevices which were introduced to make life more convenient \nare also generating a detailed electronic narrative of our lives. \nIn 2009 the British public sent sixty billion text messages, a \nfantastically detailed record of our personal interactions. At \n'Googleplex', the corporate headquarters of Google, located at \nMountain View in California, the company retains a record of \nevery Google search a person has made on the internet for two \nyears. In other words, in its memory banks Google effectively \ncontains 'virtual individuals' that consist of a cross section of \neach user's interests, tastes and thoughts. A decade ago, such \ndata was discarded by many companies, but with the cost of \nwarehousing it halving every two years, many now choose to \nretain it.35 \nNSA is already close to completing its own mammoth data \nsilo. Located in a remote desert area of Utah, this facility is \n'above top secret' and boasts a million square feet of space. \nHere, America's largest intelligence agency stores the electronic \ndetritus of the everyday lives of the nation's citizens. Billons of \nphone calls, text messages, emails, web searches, passenger lists \nand parking tickets will be warehoused here forever. Super\u00ad\ncomputers will use elaborate programmes to trawl for suspi\u00ad\ncious relationships and patterns within this data.36 Where NSA \ngoes today, GCHQ will go tomorrow. Sure enough, industry \ninsiders have alleged that a similar centre is now being created \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 547 \ninside 'the Doughnut' at Cheltenham, where a vast room of \nsuper-computers will hold an immense pool of personal infor\u00ad\nmation and protected data. Because it is not actual call or email \ncontent, no warrants are required for the authorities to gain \naccess to this material, allowing limitless trawling of everyone.37 \nThis is a whole new world of intelligence. Indeed, it is not really \nintelligence as we have traditionally understood it. In one sense \nit is a kind of sigint, given that much of it is derived from tele\u00ad\nphone calls, emails, texts and internet activity sent by means \nof a signal. However, very little of it is in code, so it is merely \nprivate or 'protected information' rather than 'top secret'. \nMoreover, much of this information is from passenger trans\u00ad\nport lists and credit-card transactions, so it is initially collected \nby corporations, not government. What governments now wish \nto do is take this data over and use it to produce a wholly new \nkind of intelligence. \nData-mining, which allows governments to search for indi\u00ad\nviduals or groups of people with particular types of behaviour, \nand to profile them as suspicious, is as powerful as it is dangerous. \nIt is powerful because it allows the sifting of titanic amounts of \nprivate information, and it is dangerous because it often throws \nup 'false positives'. In other words, some people will look suspi\u00ad\ncious because a number of chance activities have coalesced to \ngenerate something which a computer thinks is a problem.38 At \npresent, data-mining is limited because government can only \naccess so much information. But the appetite is clearly there. \nUnder the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) 2000, \nthe British authorities can ask internet service providers or mobile \nphone companies to hand over details of the phone, email and \ninternet habits of specific individuals without seeking a warrant. \nA staggering 504,073 such requests were made in 2008. Although \nthis is too many, it is still 'retail surveillance', because it relates \nto individual persons. Data-mining is the next step, and to do \nthis the authorities need constant access to everyone's data. \nIMP has been presented as a Home Office project, but just \nlike GTAC, it will be impossible to implement without the \n548 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nparticipation of GCHQ. Predictably, GCHQ is now recruiting \nmore experts in data-mining. Recent job advertisements for \nCheltenham state: 'At GCHQ, we are leaders in the emerging \nfield of data stream mining,' and that 'the next few years are \nguaranteed to be an exciting time' because of several new \ntechnologies which are 'set to dramatically change the way \nlarge volumes of information are analysed'. Areas in which \nGCHQ is currently looking for skilled personnel include 'devel\u00ad\nopment and interrogation of large databases', 'data-ware\u00ad\nhousing' and 'machine learning'. The latter is defined as \n'classification, prediction, clustering, pattern finding' .39 \nThe growth of this powerful technical surveillance has alarmed \nsenior lawyers and judges. On 20 October 2008, Sir Ken \nMacdonald QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, delivered a \npublic lecture shortly before his retirement. Entitled 'Coming \nOut of the Shadows', its subject was nothing less than tech\u00ad\nnology and the future of freedom. He explained that the same \ntechnology that has given us the impression that everything in \nthe world is at our fingertips, and has made our lives immea\u00ad\nsurably richer, hCls simultaneously given the state enormous \npowers. Because mobile phones and computers are ubiquitous, \nthe government now has access to information about each one \nof us, and the ability to collect and store it at will 'every second \nof the day, in everything we do'. He added that while this tech\u00ad\nnology is important in the struggle against serious crime, the \npublic also needs to understand that we are rapidly approaching \na cliff-edge. He warned that \n* ... decisions taken in the next few months and years about \nhow the State may use these powers, and to what extent, \nare likely to be irreversible. They will be with us forever. \nAnd they in turn will be built upon. So we should take \nvery great care to imagine the world we are creating before \nwe build it. We might end up living with something we \ncan't bear.40 \n* \nFROM BLETCHLEY PARK TO A BRAVE NEW WORLD? 549 \nSuch ominous warnings from the Director of Public Prosecutions \nare rare, and should give us real pause for thought. \nGCHQ has travelled a long and winding road. That road stretches \nfrom the wooden huts of Bletchley Park, past the domes and \ndishes of the Cold War, and on towards what some suggest will \nbe the omniscient state of a Brave New World. As we look to \nthe future, the docile and passive society described by Aldous \nHuxley in his Brave New World is perhaps a more appropriate \nanalogy than the starkly totalitarian predictions offered by \nGeorge Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Bizarrely, many British citi\u00ad\nzens are quite content in this new climate of hyper-surveillance, \nsince it is their own lifestyle choices that have helped to create \nit. GCHQ and its partners at NSA did not invent our current \n'wired world' -or even wish for it, for as we have seen, the \nnew torrents of data have been a source of endless trouble for \nthe overstretched secret agencies. As Ken Macdonald rightly \npoints out, the real drivers of our wired world have been private \ncompanies looking for growth, and private individuals in search \nof luxury and convenience at the click of a mouse. The sigint \nagencies have merely been handed the impossible task of making \nan interconnected society perfectly secure and risk-free, against \nthe background of a globalised world that presents many unpre\u00ad\ndictable threats, and HOW has few boundaries or borders to \nprotect us. \nWho, then, is to blame for the rapid intensification of elec\u00ad\ntronic surveillance? Instinctively, many might reply Osama bin \nLaden, or perhaps Pablo Escobar. Others might respond that \ngovernments have used these villains as a convenient excuse \nto extend state control. At first glance, the massive growth of \nsecurity activity, which includes not only eavesdropping but also \nbiometric monitoring, face recognition, universal fingerprinting \nand the gathering of DNA, looks like a direct response to new \nkinds of miscreants. However, the sad reality is that the Brave \nNew World that looms ahead of us is ultimately a reflection of \nourselves. It is driven by technologies such as text messaging \n550 GCHQ GOES GLOBAL \nand customer loyalty cards that we are free to accept or reject \nas we choose. The public debate on surveillance is often cast in \nterms of a trade-off between security and privacy. The truth is \nthat lUxury and convenience have been pre-eminent themes in \nthe last decade, and we have given them a much higher priority \nthan either security or privacy. We have all embraced the world \nof surveillance with remarkable eagerness, surfing the internet \nin a global search for a better bargain, better friends, even a \nbetter partner. \nGCHQ's vast new circular headquarters is sometimes repre\u00ad\nsented as a 'ring of power', exercising unparalleled levels of \nsurveillance over citizens at home and abroad, collecting every \nemail, every telephone call and every instance of internet access. \nIt has even been asserted that GCHQ is engaged in nothing \nshort of 'algorithmic warfare' as part of a battle for control of \nglobal communications. By contrast, the occupants of \nCheltenham's 'Doughnut' claim that in reality they are increas\u00ad\ningly weak, having been left behind by the unstoppable elec\u00ad\ntronic revolution with its unimaginable volumes of \ncommunications that they cannot hope to listen to, still less \nanalyse or make sense of. In fact, the frightening truth is that \nno one is in control. No person, no intelligence agency and no \ngovernment is steering the accelerating electronic processes that \nmay eventually enslave us. Most of the devices that cause us \nto leave a continual digital trail of everything we think or do \nwere not devised by the state, but are merely symptoms of \nmodernity.41 GCHQ is simply a vast mirror, and it reflects the \nspirit of the age. \nAppendix 1 \nDirectors of Government Communications \nHeadquarters \nSir Alastair Denniston 1921-1944 \nSir Edward Travis 1944-1952 \nSir Eric Jones 1952-1960 \nSir Clive ('Joe') Loehnis 1960-1964 \nSir Leonard ('Joe') Hooper 1965-1973 \nArthur ('Bill') Bonsall 1973-1978 \nSir Brian Tovey 1978-1983 \nSir Peter Marychurch 1983-1989 \nSir John Anthony Adye 1989-1996 \nSir David Omand 1996-1998 \nKevin Tebbit 1998 \nSir Francis Richards 1998-2003 \nDr David Pepper 2003-2008 \nlain Lobban 2008-\nDirectors of Communications-Electronics Security \nGroup and its predecessors \nDirector of the Cypher Policy Committee \nSir Stewart Menzies 1942-1944 \n552 APPENDIX 1 \nDirector of the Cypher Policy Board \nSir Stewart MenziEs 1944-1952 \nSecretary to the Cypher Policy Board \nCaptain Edmund Wilson RN 1944-1947 \nCaptain T.R.W.

He declared that the declassifying of hitherto highly \nsecret documents on intelligence was part of the new accounta\u00ad\nbility of the British intelligence services. Lord Mackay also empha\u00ad\nsised that government had 'released a number of previously \nwithheld government records' as an important component of the \nnew commitment to openness -and planned to release more: \n'Things have moved on. The climate has changed. Greater open\u00ad\nness has gained momentum.' Initially, I greeted these words with \nprofound scepticism. However, by the late 1990s it was clear that \nthe authorities had been as good as their word. Remarkable histor\u00ad\nical materials were making their way to the National Archives at \nKew, where they could be viewed by ordinary mortals. A number \nof Whitehall departments, most notably the Treasury under Gordon \nBrown, were very generous in releasing material on GCHQ. \nOverwhelmingly, the present study is based on this newly declas\u00ad\nsified material. Without this commendable shift towards openness \nand the generous new release of hitherto highly secret documents \non GCHQ by many departments of state, this book would not \nhave been possible. \nBecause the work stretches back over more than a decade, I \nhappily find myself in the debt of a wide array of individuals and \n568 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \ninstitutions, and it is a pleasure to have the opportunity to offer \nmy thanks here. For legal reasons I have chosen not to inter\u00ad\nview former British officials; however, I have occasionally spoken \nto 'friends and allies', and indeed 'rivals', overseas. The study has \nbeen compiled from open sources, and no classified material has \nbeen utilised. In a sense it is no more, and no less, than a summa\u00ad\ntion of the documents about GCHQ that the various authorities \nhave chosen to place in the public domain. Errors, of course, \nremain entirely my own, and given that I am writing about a \nsecret agency from unsecret sources, there are likely to be more \nthan a few. Those who wish to write to me with comments \nor corrections are most welcome, and I can be reached at \nr.j.aldrich@warwick.ac.uk or at the Department of Politics and \nInternational Studies, University of Warwick, Coventry CV4 7AL. \nMany academic friends and colleagues have guided me to \ndocuments or commented on early findings. I would particu\u00ad\nlarly like to thank David Alvarez, Peter Catterall, Philip Davies, \nStephen Dorril, David Easter, David Edgerton, Geoffrey Elliott, \nRalph Erskine, Rob Evans, John Ferris, M.R.D. Foot, Stevyn \nGibson, Roy Giles, Michael Goodman, Chris Grey, David Hamer, \nMichael Handel, Michael Herman, Peter Jackson, Rhodri \nJeffreys-Jones, Matthew Jones, Sheila Kerr, Paul Lashmar, Julian \nLewis, W. Scott Lucas, Paul Maddrell, Sir David Omand, Martin \nRudner, Len Scott, Mark Seaman, Michael Smith, David Stafford, \nAndy Sturdy, Stephen Twigge, Wesley K. Wark, Donald Cameron \nWatt and John W. Young. I am also fortunate to enjoy the \ncompany of a number of very talented research students and \nresearch fellows whose input has been invaluable. \nOn a project such as this, the assistance of departmental record \nofficers and official historians is especially important. I would \nlike to thank the many individuals who have declassified mate\u00ad\nrial for me, allowed me sight of documents, or simply explained \nthe meaning of documents to me. I would like to thank \nChristopher Simpson at the Attorney General's Office; Alan \nGlennie, Brian Hogan and Shumailla Moinuddin at the Cabinet \nOffice; Gill Bennett, Lynsey Hughes, Janet James, Penny Prior, \nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 569 \nDuncan Stewart, Stuart Taylor and Stephen Twigge at the Foreign \nand Commonwealth Office; lain Goode, Simon Marsh and Steve \nRoper at the Ministry of Defence; Rosemary Banner, Ashley \nBritten, Darren Creamer. Francis Houston, Kate Jenkins and \nSean Molloy at the Treasury; Patrick Driscoll at Treasury \nSolicitors. Ray Nolan at the Ministry of Defence needs to be \nsingled out for a special mention, having tirelessly reviewed no \nfewer than 166 files for me. Tessa Stirling, the head of the \nHistorians and Openness Unit at the Cabinet Office, has been \nnotably generous with her time, allowing me to inspect addi\u00ad\ntional material on site at the Cabinet Office. \nI have enjoyed kind assistance with my many queries from the \nGCHQ historians at Cheltenham, including the current incum\u00ad\nbent and his immediate predecessor, whom I shall refer to here \nonly as the mysterious 'M'. For much of the duration of this \nproject the GCHQ historian was the late Peter Freeman, who was \nalways encouraging, and I regret he did not see its completion. \nChris Wilson in the GCHQ press office has been helpful with more \nrecent queries. The archivists of SIS and MI5 have also assisted \nat various points. David Hatch, the historian at NSA's Center for \nCryptologic History, has also been kind in answering questions. \nArmies of archivists and librarians -tireless in their efforts -\nhave extended their kindness, and cannot all be named here. \nIn Washington, I would like to mention Nicholas Scheetz at the \nSpecial Collections Center, the Lauinger Library at Georgetown \nUniversity; and Lia Apodocia and Jeffrey M. Flannery at the \nLibrary of Congress together with Dane Hartgrove, Will Mahoney, \nKathy McCastro, Ed Reese and the legendary late John E. Taylor \nat NARA. Above all it is the staff of the National Archives (Public \nRecord Office), overworked and often confronted with an iras\u00ad\ncible researcher, but unfailingly courteous and helpful, who have \nfacilitated this book. The University of Warwick has provided a \nfriendly environment during the years over which this study \nwas completed, and also hosts the wonderful Modern Records \nCentre, under the direction of Helen Ford, with its collection of \nGCHQ trade union materials. The Warwick Institute of Advanced \n570 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \nStudy provided a constant stream of visiting fellows and research \ncolloquia with their fresh inspirations. I would like to thank the \nDirector, Margot Finn, and her colleagues for all their kindness. \nEarly research was hegun under the auspices of a British \nAcademy Large Grant in 2003 which funded lengthy trips to \nthe United States, Australia and Canada. Lee, AI and Della offered \na happy horne in Rock Creek Park while I was working in \nWashington. University House at ANU was a wonderful horne \nin Canberra, and the Canadian Association for the Study of \nIntelligence and Security has made each visit to Ottawa a joy. \nThe American dimension was also made possible by an earlier \nAmerican Studies Fellowship supported by the American Council \nof Learned Societies, the British American Studies Association \nand the Fulbright Programme. Most importantly, a year of study \nleave supported by the University of Warwick allowed the book's \ncompletion. \nThere are a few individuals to whom I owe a particularly \nheavy debt of gratitude. My literary agent, Andrew Lownie, \ndeserves special thanks for his faith in this project and for his \nunique sense of timing. Richard Johnson, Martin Redfern and \nhis colleagues at HarperCollins have been especially supportive \nand forbearing during a process that has taken longer than we \nhad hoped. Robert Lacey, David Havilland and Barry Holmes \nhave run an expert eye over advanced drafts. Matthew Aid, \nChristopher Andrew, Peter Hennessy and Cees Wiebes have \noffered crucial assistance and constant inspiration. Above all, I \nowe an enormous debt to my family for their encouragement \nover the years. My brother James cast his critical eye over the \nfinal draft. My children, Nicholas and Harriet, deserve special \nthanks for their wonderful musical distractions and theatrical \ndiversions during the book's progress. As ever my wife Libby \noffered boundless love, support and sound advice on a project \nthat seemed to have no end. \nRichard J.

The \nproject got as far as the planning stage, \nand received reluctant permission from \nthe local council. However, the review \nhalted it.

For\nthe \ufb01rst time, we demonstrate a bottom-up approach could\ndeliver state-of-the-art results on panoptic segmentation.\n1. Introduction\nPanoptic segmentation, unifying semantic segmentation\nand instance segmentation, has received a lot of attention\nthanks to the recently proposed panoptic quality metric [35]\nand associated recognition challenges [47, 16, 54]. The goal\nof panoptic segmentation is to assign a unique value, encod-\ning both semantic label and instance id, to every pixel in an\nimage. It requires identifying the class and extent of each\nindividual \u2018thing\u2019 in the image, and labelling all pixels that\nFigure 1. Our Panoptic-DeepLab predicts three outputs: seman-\ntic segmentation, instance center prediction and instance center\nregression. Class-agnostic instance segmentation, obtained by\ngrouping predicted foreground pixels to their closest predicted\ninstance centers, is then fused with semantic segmentation by\nmajority-vote rule to generate \ufb01nal panoptic segmentation.\nbelong to each \u2018stuff\u2019 class.\nThe task of panoptic segmentation introduces challenges\nthat preceding methods are unsuited to solve. Models typ-\nically used in the separate instance and semantic segmen-\ntation literature have diverged, and fundamentally different\napproaches dominate in each setting. For panoptic segmen-\ntation, the top-down methods [76, 34, 41, 44, 61], attach-\ning another semantic segmentation branch to Mask R-CNN\n[26], generate overlapping instance masks as well as du-\nplicate pixel-wise semantic predictions. To settle the con-\n\ufb02ict, the commonly employed heuristic resolves overlap-\nping instance masks by their predicted con\ufb01dence scores\n[35], or even by the pairwise relationship between cate-\ngories [44] ( e.g.,tiesshould be always in front of per-\nson). Additionally, the discrepancy between semantic and\ninstance segmentation results are sorted out by favoring the\ninstance predictions. Though effective, it may be hard to\nimplement the hand-crafted heuristics in a fast and paral-\nlel fashion. Another effective way is to develop advanced\nmodules to fuse semantic and instance segmentation results\n[44, 41, 76]. However, these top-down methods are usually\n1arXiv:1911.10194v3  [cs.CV]  11 Mar 2020\nslow in speed, resulted from the multiple sequential pro-\ncesses in the pipeline.\nOn the other hand, bottom-up methods naturally resolve\nthe con\ufb02ict by predicting non-overlapping segments. Only\nfew works [77, 23] adopt the bottom-up approach, which\ntypically starts with a semantic segmentation prediction fol-\nlowed by grouping operations to generate instance masks.\nTackling panoptic segmentation in such a sequential order\nallows a simple and fast scheme, such as majority vote [77],\nto merge semantic and instance segmentation results. Al-\nthough obtaining promising fast inference speed, bottom-\nup approaches still demonstrate inferior performance com-\npared to top-down ones prevailing in public benchmarks\n[47, 16, 54].\nThe dif\ufb01culties faced by top-down methods, and the\ndearth of previous investigations into complementary ap-\nproaches motivate us to establish a simple, strong, and fast\nbottom-up baseline for panoptic segmentation. Our pro-\nposed Panoptic-DeepLab (Fig. 1) requires only three loss\nfunctions during training, and introduces extra marginal pa-\nrameters as well as additional slight computation overhead\nwhen building on top of a modern semantic segmentation\nmodel. The design of the proposed Panoptic-DeepLab is\nconceptually simple, adopting dual-ASPP and dual-decoder\nmodules speci\ufb01c to semantic segmentation and instance\nsegmentation, respectively. The semantic segmentation\nbranch follows the typical design of any semantic segmenta-\ntion model ( e.g., DeepLab [11]), while the instance segmen-\ntation branch involves a simple instance center regression\n[4, 31], where the model learns to predict instance centers as\nwell as the offset from each pixel to its corresponding cen-\nter, resulting in an extremely simple grouping operation by\nassigning pixels to their closest predicted center. Addition-\nally, with fast GPU implementation of the merging opera-\ntion, Panoptic-DeepLab delivers near real-time end-to-end\npanoptic segmentation prediction.\nWe conduct experiments on several popular panoptic\nsegmentation datasets. On Cityscapes test set [16], a sin-\nglePanoptic-DeepLab model (without \ufb01ne-tuning on dif-\nferent tasks) achieves state-of-the-art performance of 65.5%\nPQ, 39.0% AP, and 84.2% mIoU, simultaneously ranking\n\ufb01rst on allthree Cityscapes tasks when comparing with\npublished works. On Mapillary Vistas [54], our best sin-\nglemodel attains 40.6% PQ on val set, while employ-\ning an ensemble of 6 models reaches a performance of\n42.2% PQ on val set and 42.7% PQ on test set, outper-\nforming the winner of Mapillary Vistas Panoptic Segmen-\ntation Challenge in 2018 by a healthy margin of 1.5% PQ.\nFor the \ufb01rst time, we show a bottom-up approach could de-\nliver state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation results on both\nCityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. On COCO [47] test-dev\nset, our Panoptic-DeepLab also demonstrates state-of-the-\nart results, performing on par with several top-down ap-proaches. Finally, we provide extensive experimental re-\nsults and disclose every detail in our system. We hope our\nPanoptic-DeepLab could serve as a solid baseline to facili-\ntate the research on panoptic segmentation, especially from\nthe bottom-up perspective.\n2. Related Works\nWe categorize current panoptic segmentation methods\n[35] into two groups: top-down and bottom-up approaches.\nTop-down: Most state-of-the-art methods tackle panop-\ntic segmentation from the top-down or proposal-based per-\nspective. These methods are often referred to as two-stage\nmethods because they require an additional stage to gen-\nerate proposals. Speci\ufb01cally, Mask R-CNN [26] is com-\nmonly deployed to extract overlapping instances , followed\nby some post-processing methods to resolve mask overlaps.\nThe remaining regions are then \ufb01lled by a light-weight stuff\nsegmentation branch. For example, TASCNet [41] learns\na binary mask to enforce the consistency between \u2018thing\u2019\nand \u2018stuff\u2019 predictions. Liu et al. [53] propose the Spatial\nRanking module to resolve the overlapping instance masks.\nAUNet [44] introduces attention modules to guide the fu-\nsion between \u2018thing\u2019 and \u2018stuff\u2019 segmentation. Panoptic\nFPN [34] endows Mask R-CNN [26] with a semantic seg-\nmentation branch. UPSNet [76] develops a parameter-free\npanoptic head which resolves the con\ufb02icts in \u2018thing\u2019-\u2018stuff\u2019\nfusion by predicting an extra unknown class. Porzi et al.\n[61] integrate the multi-scale features from FPN [46] with\na light-weight DeepLab-inspired module [9]. AdaptIS [67]\ngenerates instance masks with point proposals.\nBottom-up: On the other hand, there are few bottom-\nup or proposal-free methods for panoptic segmentation.\nThese works typically get the semantic segmentation pre-\ndiction before detecting instances by grouping \u2018thing\u2019 pix-\nels into clusters. The \ufb01rst bottom-up approach, Deeper-\nLab [77], adopts bounding box corners as well as object\ncenters for class-agnostic instance segmentation, coupled\nwith DeepLab semantic segmentation outputs [8, 10]. Re-\ncently, SSAP [23] proposes to group pixels based on a\npixel-pair af\ufb01nity pyramid [52] with an ef\ufb01cient graph par-\ntition method [32]. Unfortunately, given its simplicity ( i.e.,\na single pass of the system for prediction), bottom-up ap-\nproaches perform inferiorly to top-down methods at almost\nallpublic benchmarks. In this work, we aim to push the en-\nvelope of bottom-up approaches. We note that there are sev-\neral instance segmentation works [79, 70, 78, 2, 49, 36, 57,\n21, 18, 45, 38, 31, 52, 55, 6], which could be potentially ex-\ntended to bottom-up panoptic segmentation. Additionally,\nour method bears a similarity to Hough-V oting-based meth-\nods [4, 40, 22, 5] and recent works by Kendall et al. [31],\nUhrig et al. [71] and Neven et al. [55] in the sense that our\nclass-agnostic instance segmentation is obtained by regress-\ning foreground pixels to their centers. However, our method\n2\nFigure 2. Our Panoptic-DeepLab adopts dual-context and dual-decoder modules for semantic segmentation and instance segmentation\npredictions. We apply atrous convolution in the last block of a network backbone to extract denser feature map. The Atrous Spatial Pyramid\nPooling (ASPP) is employed in the context module as well as a light-weight decoder module consisting of a single convolution during each\nupsampling stage. The instance segmentation prediction is obtained by predicting the object centers and regressing every foreground pixel\n(i.e., pixels with predicted \u2018thing\u2018 class) to their corresponding center. The predicted semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance\nsegmentation are then fused to generate the \ufb01nal panoptic segmentation result by the \u201dmajority vote\u201d proposed by DeeperLab.\nis even simpler than theirs: we directly predict the instance\ncenter locations and group pixels to their closest predicted\ncenters. As a result, our method does not require the cluster-\ning method OPTICS [1] used in [31], or the advanced clus-\ntering loss function proposed in [55]. Finally, our model\nemploys the parallel multi-head prediction framework sim-\nilar to [70, 37, 56].\nKeypoint representation: Recently, keypoint represen-\ntations have been used for instance segmentation and ob-\nject detection. Newell et al. [57] group pixels by embed-\nding vectors. PersonLab [59] generates person segmenta-\ntion masks and groups them into instances by learning off-\nset to their detected keypoints. CornerNet [39] detects ob-\njects by predicting paired corners and group corners based\non [57]. ExtremeNet [81] groups \u2018extreme points\u2019 [58] ac-\ncording to the relation to a center point. Zhou et al. [80]\nand Duan et al. [20] exploit instance centers for object de-\ntection. Following the same direction, we represent each\ninstance by its center and take a step further by showing\nthat such a simple representation is able to achieve state-of-\nthe-art panoptic segmentation results on several challeng-\ning datasets. Different from keypoint-based detection, our\nPanoptic-DeepLab only requires class-agnostic object cen-\nter prediction.\n3. Panoptic-DeepLab\nAs shown in Fig. 2, our proposed Panoptic-DeepLab is\ndeployed in a bottom-up and single-shot manner.3.1. Architecture\nPanoptic-DeepLab consists of four components: (1) an\nencoder backbone shared for both semantic segmentation\nand instance segmentation, (2) decoupled ASPP modules\nand (3) decoupled decoder modules speci\ufb01c to each task,\nand (4) task-speci\ufb01c prediction heads.\nBasic architecture: The encoder backbone is adapted\nfrom an ImageNet-pretrained neural network paired with\natrous convolution for extracting denser feature maps in its\nlast block. Motivated by [14, 13, 55], we employ separate\nASPP and decoder modules for semantic segmentation and\ninstance segmentation, respectively, based on the hypothe-\nsis that those two branches requires different contextual and\ndecoding information, which is empirically veri\ufb01ed in the\nfollowing section. Our light-weight decoder module fol-\nlows DeepLabV3+ [11] with two modi\ufb01cations: (1) we in-\ntroduce an additional low-level feature with output stride 8\nto the decoder, thus the spatial resolution is gradually recov-\nered by a factor of 2, and (2) in each upsampling stage we\napply a single 5\u00025depthwise-separable convolution [29].\nSemantic segmentation head: We employ the weighted\nbootstrapped cross entropy loss, proposed in [77], for se-\nmantic segmentation, predicting both \u2018thing\u2019 and \u2018stuff\u2019\nclasses. The loss improves over bootstrapped cross entropy\nloss [74, 7, 60] by weighting each pixel differently.\nClass-agnostic instance segmentation head: Moti-\nvated by Hough V oting [4, 31], we represent each object\ninstance by its center of mass. For every foreground pixel\n(i.e., pixel whose class is a \u2018thing\u2019), we further predict the\noffset to its corresponding mass center. During training,\n3\ngroundtruth instance centers are encoded by a 2-D Gaus-\nsian with standard deviation of 8 pixels [69]. In particular,\nwe adopt the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss to minimize\nthe distance between predicted heatmaps and 2D Gaussian-\nencoded groundtruth heatmaps. We use L1loss for the off-\nset prediction, which is only activated at pixels belonging\nto object instances. During inference, predicted foreground\npixels (obtained by \ufb01ltering out background \u2018stuff\u2019 regions\nfrom semantic segmentation prediction) are grouped to their\nclosest predicted mass center, forming our class-agnostic\ninstance segmentation results, as detailed below.\n3.2. Panoptic Segmentation\nDuring inference, we use an extremely simple grouping\noperation to obtain instance masks, and a highly ef\ufb01cient\nmajority voting algorithm to merge semantic and instance\nsegmentation into \ufb01nal panoptic segmentation.\nSimple instance representation: We simply represent\neach object by its center of mass, fCn: (in;jn)g. To ob-\ntain the center point prediction, we \ufb01rst perform a keypoint-\nbased non-maximum suppression (NMS) on the instance\ncenter heatmap prediction, essentially equivalent to apply-\ning max pooling on the heatmap prediction and keeping lo-\ncations whose values do not change before and after max\npooling. Finally, a hard threshold is used to \ufb01lter out pre-\ndictions with low con\ufb01dence, and only locations with top-k\nhighest con\ufb01dence scores are kept. In experiments, we use\nmax-pooling with kernel size 7, threshold 0.1, and k= 200 .\nSimple instance grouping: To obtain the instance id for\neach pixel, we use a simple instance center regression. For\nexample, consider a predicted \u2018thing\u2019 pixel at location (i;j),\nwe predict an offset vector O(i;j)to its instance center.\nO(i;j)is a vector with two elements, representing the off-\nset in horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. The\ninstance id for the pixel is thus the index of the closest in-\nstance center after moving the pixel location (i;j)by the\noffsetO(i;j). That is,\n^ki;j= argmin\nkjjCk\u0000((i;j) +O(i;j))jj2\nwhere ^ki;jis the predicted instance id for pixel at (i;j).\nWe use semantic segmentation prediction to \ufb01lter out\n\u2018stuff\u2019 pixels whose instance id are always set to 0.\nEf\ufb01cient merging: Given the predicted semantic seg-\nmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation results,\nwe adopt a fast and parallelizable method to merge the re-\nsults, following the \u201cmajority vote\u201d principle proposed in\nDeeperLab [77]. In particular, the semantic label of a pre-\ndicted instance mask is inferred by the majority vote of the\ncorresponding predicted semantic labels. This operation\nis essentially accumulating the class label histograms, and\nthus is ef\ufb01ciently implemented in GPU, which takes only 3\nms when operating on a 1025\u00022049 input.3.3. Instance Segmentation\nPanoptic-DeepLab can also generate instance segmenta-\ntion predictions as a by-product. To properly evaluate the\ninstance segmentation results, one needs to associate a con-\n\ufb01dence score with each predicted instance mask. Previous\nbottom-up instance segmentation methods use some heuris-\ntics to obtain the con\ufb01dence scores. For example, DWT\n[2] and SSAP [23] use an average of semantic segmenta-\ntion scores for some easy classes and use random scores\nfor other harder classes. Additionally, they remove masks\nwhose areas are below a certain threshold for each class.\nOn the other hand, our Panoptic-DeepLab does not adopt\nany heuristic or post processing for instance segmentation.\nMotivated by YOLO [63], we compute the class-speci\ufb01c\ncon\ufb01dence score for each instance mask as\nScore (Objectness )\u0002Score (Class )\nwhereScore (Objectness )is unnormalized objectness\nscore obtained from the class-agnostic center point\nheatmap, and Score (Class )is obtained from the average\nof semantic segmentation predictions within the predicted\nmask region.\n4. Experiments\nCityscapes [16]: The dataset consists of 2975, 500, and\n1525 traf\ufb01c-related images for training, validation, and test-\ning, respectively. It contains 8 \u2018thing\u2019 and 11 \u2018stuff\u2019 classes.\nMapillary Vistas [54]: A large-scale traf\ufb01c-related\ndataset, containing 18K, 2K, and 5K images for training,\nvalidation and testing, respectively. It contains 37 \u2018thing\u2019\nclasses and 28 \u2018stuff\u2019 classes in a variety of image resolu-\ntions, ranging from 1024\u0002768to more than 4000\u00026000\nCOCO [47]: There are 118K, 5K, and 20K images for\ntraining, validation, and testing, respectively. The dataset\nconsists of 80 \u2018thing\u2018 and 53 \u2018stuff\u2018 classes.\nExperimental setup: We report mean IoU, average pre-\ncision (AP), and panoptic quality (PQ) to evaluate the se-\nmantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation results.\nAll our models are trained using TensorFlow on 32\nTPUs. We adopt a similar training protocol as in [11].\nIn particular, we use the \u2018poly\u2019 learning rate policy [51]\nwith an initial learning rate of 0:001, \ufb01ne-tune the batch\nnormalization [30] parameters, perform random scale data\naugmentation during training, and optimize with Adam\n[33] without weight decay . On Cityscapes, our best set-\nting is obtained by training with whole image ( i.e., crop\nsize equal to 1025\u00022049 ) with batch size 32. On Map-\nillary Vistas, we resize the images to 2177 pixels at the\nlongest side to handle the large input variations, and ran-\ndomly crop 1025\u00021025 patches during training with batch\nsize 64. On COCO, we resize the images to 1025 pix-\nels at the longest side and train our models with crop size\n4\nAdam MSE De. x2 ASPP x2 L-Crop C Sem= 256 CIns= 256 Sem.

We set training itera-\ntions to 60K, 150K, and 200K for Cityscapes, Mapillary\nVistas, and COCO, respectively. During evaluation, due to\nthe sensitivity of PQ [76, 41, 61], we re-assign to \u2018VOID\u2019\nlabel all \u2018stuff\u2019 segments whose areas are smaller than a\nthreshold.

To make sure the\nlosses are in the similar magnitude, we set \u0015heatmap = 200\nand\u0015offset = 0:01.\n4.1. Ablation Studies\nWe conduct ablation studies on Cityscapes validation\nset, as shown in Tab. 1. Replacing SGD momentum opti-\nmizer with Adam optimizer yields 0.7% PQ improvement.\nInstead of using the sigmoid cross entropy loss for train-\ning the heatmap ( i.e., instance center prediction), it brings\n0.8% PQ improvement by applying the Mean Squared Er-\nror (MSE) loss to minimize the distance between the pre-\ndicted heatmap and the 2D Gaussian-encoded groundtruth\nheatmap. It is more effective to adopt both dual-decoder and\n5\ndual-ASPP, which gives us 0.7% PQ improvement while\nmaintaining similar AP and mIoU. Employing a large crop\nsize1025\u00022049 (instead of 513\u00021025 ) during training fur-\nther improves the AP and mIoU by 0.6% and 0.9% respec-\ntively. Finally, increasing the feature channels from 128 to\n256 in the semantic segmentation branch achieves our best\nresult of 63.0% PQ, 35.3% AP, and 80.5% mIoU.\nMulti-task learning: For reference, we train a\nSemantic-DeepLab under the same setting as the best\nPanoptic-DeepLab (last row of Tab. 1), showing that multi-\ntask learning does not bring extra gain to mIoU. Note\nthat Panoptic-DeepLab adds marginal parameters and small\ncomputation overhead over Semantic-DeepLab.\n4.2. Cityscapes\nVal set: In Tab. 2, we report our Cityscapes validation\nset results. When using only Cityscapes \ufb01neannotations,\nour best Panoptic-DeepLab, with multi-scale inputs and\nleft-right \ufb02ips, outperforms the best bottom-up approach,\nSSAP, by 3.0% PQ and 1.2% AP, and is better than the best\nproposal-based approach, AdaptIS, by 2.1% PQ, 2.2% AP,\nand 2.3% mIoU. When using extra data, our best Panoptic-\nDeepLab outperforms UPSNet by 5.2% PQ, 3.5% AP, and\n3.9% mIoU, and Seamless by 2.0% PQ and 2.4% mIoU.\nNote that we do not exploit any other data, such as COCO,\nCityscapes coarse annotations, depth, or video.\nTest set: On the test set, we additionally employ the trick\nproposed in [11] that applies atrous convolution in the last\ntwo blocks within the backbone, with rate 2 and 4 respec-\ntively, during inference. This trick brings an extra 0.4% AP\nand 0.2% mIoU on valset but no improvement over PQ.\nWe do not use this trick for the Mapillary Vistas Challenge.\nAs shown in Tab. 3, our single uni\ufb01ed Panoptic-DeepLab\nachieves state-of-the-art results, ranking \ufb01rst at allthree\nCityscapes tasks, when comparing with published works.\nOur model ranks second in the instance segmentation track\nwhen also taking into account unpublished entries.\n4.3. Mapillary Vistas\nVal set: In Tab. 4, we report Mapillary Vistas valset re-\nsults. Our best single Panoptic-DeepLab model, with multi-\nscale inputs and left-right \ufb02ips, outperforms the bottom-up\napproach, DeeperLab, by 8.3% PQ, and the top-down ap-\nproach, Seamless, by 2.6% PQ. In Tab. 5, we report our re-\nsults with three families of network backbones. We observe\nthat na \u00a8\u0131ve HRNet-W48 slightly under-performs Xception-\n71. Due to the diverse image resolutions in Mapillary Vis-\ntas, we found it important to enrich the context informa-\ntion as well as to keep high-resolution features. There-\nfore, we propose a simple modi\ufb01cation for HRNet [72] and\nAuto-DeepLab [48]. For modi\ufb01ed HRNet, called HRNet+,\nwe keep its ImageNet-pretrained head and further attach\ndual-ASPP and dual-decoder modules.

On the other hand, top-down methods handle\nscale variation to some extent by the ROIPooling [24] or\nROIAlign [26] operations which normalize regional fea-\ntures to a canonical scale [25, 64]. Additionally, incorporat-\ning scale-aware information to feature pyramid [46] or im-\nage pyramid [66] may improve the performance of bottom-\nup methods.\nPQThingvs. PQStuff:As shown in Tab. 6 and Tab. 8,\nPanoptic-DeepLab has higher PQStuffbut lower PQThing\nwhen compared with other top-down approaches which bet-\nter handle instances of large scale variation as discussed\nabove. Combining the best from both bottom-up and top-\ndown approaches is thus interesting to explore but beyond\nthe scope of current work.\nPanoptic vs. instance annotations: Most bottom-up\npanoptic segmentation methods only exploit the panoptic\nannotations. We notice there are two types of annotations in\nthe COCO dataset, panoptic annotations and instance anno-\ntations. The former do not allow overlapping masks (thuscreating occlusions among masks), while the latter allows\noverlaps, which might make the training target easier to op-\ntimize, similar to amodal segmentation [83, 42].\nEnd-to-end training: Current bottom-up panoptic seg-\nmentation methods still require some post-processing steps\nto obtain the \ufb01nal panoptic segmentation, which may make\nit hard to end-to-end train the whole system.\n5. Conclusion\nWe have presented Panoptic-DeepLab, a simple, strong,\nand fast baseline for bottom-up panoptic segmentation.\nPanoptic-DeepLab is simple in design, requiring only three\nloss functions during training and adds marginal parame-\nters to a modern semantic segmentation model. Panoptic-\nDeepLab is the \ufb01rst bottom-up and single-shot panop-\ntic segmentation model that attains state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance on several public benchmarks, and delivers near real-\ntime end-to-end inference speed. We hope our simple and\neffective model could establish a solid baseline and further\nbene\ufb01t the research community.\n8\nOriginal HRNet Segmentation Head\nFigure 5. Semantic segmentation head proposed in HRNet [72].\nA. HRNet Variant\nWe introduce our modi\ufb01cations to the HRNet [68, 72]\nthat are used in our ensemble model [12] for Mapillary Vis-\ntas. All hyper-parameters for training HRNet variants are\nthe same as Xception, except that the learning rate is set to\n7:5e\u00004.\nA.1. HRNet\nThe original segmentation head for HRNet is shown in\nFig. 5. Features from all four resolutions are \ufb01rst upsampled\nto the 1/4 resolution and concatenated, followed by another\n1\u00021convolution to fuse features.\nTo pre-train the HRNet on ImageNet [19], Wang et\nal. [72] designed a speci\ufb01c image classi\ufb01cation head which\ngradually downsamples the feature maps, as shown in\nFig. 6 (a). Speci\ufb01cally, a bottleneck residual module [27]\nis applied to every output resolution to increase the chan-\nnels. The feature map from the \ufb01nest spatial resolution ( i.e.,\n1/4 resolution) is then downsampled by sequentially using a\n3\u00023convolution with stride 2. At the \ufb01nal 1/32 resolution\nfeature map, a global average pooling and a fully connected\nlayer are attached for ImageNet classi\ufb01cation.\nA.2. HRNet+\nAfter pre-training on ImageNet, Wang et al . [72] re-\nmoved the image classi\ufb01cation head. However, we observe\nthat the classi\ufb01cation head takes around 20% of the total\nparameters, which is a waste of information if discarded.\nTherefore, we propose to keep this classi\ufb01cation head in our\nmodi\ufb01ed HRNet+ (Fig. 6 (b)). Starting from the image clas-\nsi\ufb01cation HRNet, we replace the \ufb01nal global average pool-\ning and linear classi\ufb01er with an ASPP module, and build a\nsimilar decoder as shown in Fig. 2 of main paper with some\ndifferences that the output stride of encoder is now 32 in-\nstead of 16 and we introduce one more encoder feature map\nof stride 16 to the decoder by \ufb01rst projecting its channels to\n96.\nOriginal HRNet Classification Head\n(a) Image classi\ufb01cation head proposed in HRNet [72], which is discarded\nafter pre-training on ImageNet.\nOur HRNet+\n(b) Our proposed HRNet+, which keeps the image classi\ufb01cation head\nand attaches the ASPP module as well as the decoder module for\nsegmentation tasks.\nOur HRNet-Wider+\n(c) Our proposed HRNet-Wider+, which reduces the model parameters\nand computations by adopting the Xception module.\nFigure 6. Demonstration of our proposed variants of HRNet [72].\nA.3. HRNet-Wider+\nWe additionally propose HRNet-Wider+ (Fig. 6 (c)) that\nreplaces the basic residual module [27] with the Xception\nmodule [15], signi\ufb01cantly reducing the model parameters\nand computation FLOPs at the cost of marginal degradation\nin performance. Additionally, we employ the number of\nchannelsf64;256;384;384gfor each resolution (instead of\nf48;96;192;384g).\nA.4. Atrous HRNet\nAnother modi\ufb01cation of HRNet that we have explored is\nreferred to as HRNet+ (Atrous), where we remove all the\ndownsampling operations that generate 1/32 resolution fea-\n9\nDecoder Backbone Input Size PQ (%)AP (%)mIoU ( %)Speed (ms) Params (M) M-Adds (B)\nDeepLabV3+ [11] Xception-71 1025\u00022049 62.5 34.5 80.2 176 46.61 553.41\nPanoptic-DeepLab Xception-71 1025\u00022049 63.0 35.3 80.5 175 46.72 547.49\nTable 10.

This modi\ufb01cation increases the computation\nFLOPs but does not improve the performance compared to\nits HRNet+ counterpart.\nB. Auto-DeepLab Variant\nWe make a simple modi\ufb01cation to the Auto-\nDeepLab [48] in Fig. 7 by removing the stride in the\nconvolution that generates the 1/32 feature map in order to\nkeep high spatial resolution within the network backbone.\nWe \ufb01nd this modi\ufb01cation improves 1%PQ on Mapillary\nVistas validation set.\nC. Comparison with DeepLabV3+ decoder\nAs mentioned in the main paper that the decoder of\nPanoptic-DeepLab is slightly different from the one in\nDeepLabv3+ [11]. Herein, we compare their performance\non Cityscapes validation set, as shown in Tab. 10. Panoptic-\nDeepLab outperforms DeepLabv3+ by 0:5%PQ,0:8%AP,\nand0:3%mIOU, showing more improvement in the in-\nstance segmentation task. Additionally, Panoptic-DeepLab\nis slightly faster than DeepLabv3+ at the cost of extra\nmarginal parameters.\nD.

Panoptic Annotation\n(a) Image(b) Instance: All(c) Instance: Person(d) Panoptic: Person\nFigure 8. Illustration of the difference between instance and\npanoptic annotation on COCO.\nIn Tab. 11, we experiment with different con\ufb01dence\nscores when evaluating instance segmentation results. We\nfound that using Score(Objectness) alone leads to 28.9%\nAP, Score(Class) alone produces 35.1% AP, while employ-\ning Score(Objectness) \u0002Score(Class) generates the best re-\nsult (35.3% AP). We would like to highlight that the choice\nof different con\ufb01dence score does not affect our \ufb01nal mIoU\nand PQ results, since our Panoptic-DeepLab does not pro-\nduce overlapping predictions and therefore does not re-\nquire a con\ufb01dence score to rank predictions (or to resolve\nthe con\ufb02ict among overlapping predictions) like Panoptic-\nFPN [34]. Con\ufb01dence score is only used in computing AP\nto rank instance mask predictions. Since it is only used for\nthe purpose of ranking, the con\ufb01dence score does not nec-\nessarily need to be a probability.\nE. Instance and Panoptic Annotation\nFig. 8 shows an example to illustrate the difference be-\ntween instance annotation and panoptic annotation on the\nCOCO dataset. Instance annotation, unlike panoptic anno-\ntation, allows overlapping groundtruth masks. For exam-\nple, the \u2018person\u2019 mask ignores the existence of the \u2018tie\u2019 and\n\u2018bottle\u2019 masks in the instance annotation, while the \u2018per-\nson\u2019 mask has occlusions caused by other instances in the\npanoptic annotation.\nWe notice that all top-down methods based on Mask R-\nCNN [26] use the instance annotation [44, 34, 76] when\ntrained on COCO, while bottom-up methods [77] including\nour Panoptic-DeepLab use the panoptic annotation on all\ndatasets.\nF. More Visualization\nWe provide more visualization results of our Panoptic-\nDeepLab in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, and Fig. 11.\n10\nReferences\n[1] Mihael Ankerst, Markus M Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel,\nand J \u00a8org Sander.

Most existing methods have\nindirectly addressed this task by detecting human and ob-\nject instances and individually inferring every pair of the\ndetected instances. In this paper, we present a novel frame-\nwork, referred by HOTR, which directly predicts a set of\nhhuman, object, interaction itriplets from an image based\non a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Through\nthe set prediction, our method effectively exploits the in-\nherent semantic relationships in an image and does not\nrequire time-consuming post-processing which is the main\nbottleneck of existing methods. Our proposed algorithm\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance in two HOI de-\ntection benchmarks with an inference time under 1 ms after\nobject detection.\n1. Introduction\nHuman-Object Interaction (HOI) detection has been for-\nmally de\ufb01ned in [8] as the task to predict a set of hhuman,\nobject, interactionitriplets within an image. Previous meth-\nods have addressed this task in an indirect manner by\nperforming object detection \ufb01rst and associating hhuman,\nobjectipairs afterward with separate post-processing steps.\nEspecially, early attempts ( i.e., sequential HOI detectors [5,\n18, 17, 26]) have performed this association with a subse-\nquent neural network, thus being time-consuming and com-\nputationally expensive.\nTo overcome the redundant inference structure of se-\nquential HOI detectors, recent researches [30, 19, 12] pro-\nposed parallel HOI detectors. These works explicitly lo-\ncalize interactions with either interaction boxes ( i.e., the\ntightest box that covers both the center point of an object\nycorresponding authors\nFigure 1. Time vs. Performance analysis for HOI detectors on\nV-COCO dataset. HOI recognition inference time is measured by\nsubtracting the object detection time from the end-to-end inference\ntime. Blue circle represents sequential HOI detectors, orange cir-\ncle represents parallel HOI detectors and red star represents ours.\nOur method achieves an HOI recognition inference time of 0.9ms,\nbeing signi\ufb01cantly faster than the parallel HOI detectors such as\nIPNet [30] or UnionDet [12] (the comparison between parallel\nHOI detectors is highlighted in blue).\npair) [30, 19] or union boxes ( i.e., the tightest box that cov-\ners both the box regions of an object pair) [12]. The lo-\ncalized interactions are associated with object detection re-\nsults to complete the hhuman, object, interaction itriplet.\nThe time-consuming neural network inference is replaced\nwith a simple matching based on heuristics such as dis-\ntance [30, 19] or IoU [12].\nHowever, previous works in HOI detection are still\nlimited in two aspects; i) They require additional post-\nprocessing steps like suppressing near-duplicate predictions\nand heuristic thresholding. ii) Although it has been shown\nthat modeling relations between objects helps object detec-\ntion [11, 2], the effectiveness of considering high-level de-\npendency for interactions in HOI detection has not yet been\nfully explored.\nIn this paper, we propose a fast and accurate HOI al-\ngorithm named HOTR (Human-Object interaction TRans-arXiv:2104.13682v1  [cs.CV]  28 Apr 2021\nformer) that predicts a set of human-object interactions in a\nscene at once with a direct set prediction approach. We de-\nsign an encoder-decoder architecture based on transformers\nto predict a set of HOI triplets, which enables the model\nto overcome both limitations of previous works. First, di-\nrect set-level prediction enables us to eliminate hand-crafted\npost-processing stage. Our model is trained in an end-\nto-end fashion with a set loss function that matches the\npredicted interactions with ground-truth hhuman, object,\ninteractionitriplets. Second, the self-attention mechanisms\nof transformers makes the model exploit the contextual rela-\ntionships between human and object and their interactions,\nencouraging our set-level prediction framework more suit-\nable for high-level scene understanding.\nWe evaluate our model in two HOI detection bench-\nmarks: V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets. Our proposed\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\ndatasets compared to both sequential and parallel HOI de-\ntectors. Also, note that our method is much faster than other\nalgorithms as illustrated in Figure 1, by eliminating time-\nconsuming post-processing through the direct set-level pre-\ndiction. The contribution of this work can be summarized\nas the following:\n\u2022 We propose HOTR, the \ufb01rst transformer-based set pre-\ndiction approach in HOI detection. HOTR elimi-\nnates the hand-crafted post-processing stage of previ-\nous HOI detectors while being able to model the cor-\nrelations between interactions.\n\u2022 We propose various training and inference techniques\nfor HOTR: HO Pointers to associate the outputs of two\nparallel decoders, a recomposition step to predict a set\nof \ufb01nal HOI triplets, and a new loss function to enable\nend-to-end training.\n\u2022 HOTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on both\nbenchmark datasets in HOI detection with an inference\ntime under 1 ms, being signi\ufb01cantly faster than previ-\nous parallel HOI detectors (5 \u00189 ms).\n2. Related Work\n2.1. Human-Object Interaction Detection\nHuman-Object Interaction detection has been initially\nproposed in [8], and has been developed in two main\nstreams: sequential methods and parallel methods. In\nsequential methods, object detection is performed \ufb01rst\nand every pair of the detected object is inferred with a\nseparate neural network to predict interactions. Parallel\nHOI detectors perform object detection and interaction\nprediction in parallel and associates them with simple\nheuristics such as distance or IoU.Sequential HOI Detectors: InteractNet [6] extended an\nexisting object detector by introducing an action-speci\ufb01c\ndensity map to localize target objects based on the human-\ncentric appearance, and combined features from individual\nboxes to predict the interaction. Note that interaction\ndetection based on visual cues from individual boxes often\nsuffers from the lack of contextual information.\nTo this end, iCAN [5] proposed an instance-centric\nattention module that extracts contextual features comple-\nmentary to the features from the localized objects/humans.\nNo-Frills HOI detection [9] propose a training and infer-\nence HOI detection pipeline only using simple multi-layer\nperceptron. Graph-based approaches have proposed frame-\nworks that can explicitly represent HOI structures with\ngraphs [24, 26, 4, 28, 21]. Deep Contextual Attention [29]\nleverages contextual information by a contextual attention\nframework in HOI. [28] proposes a heterogeneous graph\nnetwork that models humans and objects as different kinds\nof nodes. Various external sources such as linguistic\npriors [23, 31, 17, 4, 1, 32, 20] or human pose infor-\nmation [15, 33, 18, 9, 27, 33] have also been leveraged\nfor further improve performance. Although sequential\nHOI detectors feature a fairly intuitive pipeline and solid\nperformance, they are time-consuming and computation-\nally expensive because of the additional neural network\ninference after the object detection phase.\nParallel HOI Detectors: Attempts for faster HOI detec-\ntion has been also introduced in recent works as parallel\nHOI detectors. These works have directly localized inter-\nactions with interaction points [30, 19] or union boxes [12],\nreplacing the separate neural network for interaction predic-\ntion with a simple heuristic based matching with distance\nor IoUs. Since they can be parallelized with existing ob-\nject detectors, they feature fast inference time. However,\nthese works are limited in that they require a hand-crafted\npostprocessing stage to associate the localized interactions\nwith object detection results. This post-processing step i)\nrequires manual search for the threshold, and ii) generates\nextra time complexity for matching each object pairs with\nthe localized interactions (5 \u00189 ms).\n2.2. Object Detection with Transformers\nDETR [2] has been recently proposed to eliminate the\nneed for many hand-designed components in object detec-\ntion while demonstrating good performance. DETR infers\na \ufb01xed-size set of Npredictions, in a single pass through\nthe decoder, where Nis set to be signi\ufb01cantly larger than\nthe typical number of objects in an image. The main loss\nfor DETR produces an optimal bipartite matching between\npredicted and ground-truth objects. Afterward, the object-\nspeci\ufb01c losses (for class and bounding box) are optimized.\nFigure 2. Overall pipeline of our proposed model. The Instance Decoder and Interaction Decoder run in parallel, and share the Encoder. In\nour recomposition, the interaction representations predicted by the Interaction Decoder are associated with the instance representations to\npredict a \ufb01xed set of HOI triplets (see Fig.3). The positional encoding is identical to [2].\n3. Method\nThe goal of this paper is to predict a set of hhuman, ob-\nject, interactionitriplets while considering the inherent se-\nmantic relationships between the triplets in an end-to-end\nmanner. To achieve this goal, we formulate HOI detection\nas set prediction. In this section, we \ufb01rst discuss the prob-\nlems of directly extending the set prediction architecture for\nobject detection [2] to HOI detection. Then, we propose our\narchitecture HOTR that parallelly predicts a set of object\ndetection and associates the human and object of the inter-\naction, while the self-attention in transformers models the\nrelationships between the interactions. Finally, we present\nthe details of training for our model including Hungarian\nMatching for HOI detection and our loss function.\n3.1. Detection as Set Prediction\nWe \ufb01rst start from object detection as set prediction with\ntransformers, then show how we extend this architecture to\ncapture HOI detection with transformers.\nObject Detection as Set Prediction. Object Detection has\nbeen explored as a set prediction problem by DETR [2].\nSince object detection includes a single classi\ufb01cation\nand a single localization for each object, the transformer\nencoder-decoder structure in DETR transforms Nposi-\ntional embeddings to a set of Npredictions for the object\nclass and bounding box.\nHOI Detection as Set Prediction. Similar to object\ndetection, HOI detection can be de\ufb01ned as a set prediction\nproblem where each prediction includes the localization\nof a human region ( i.e.,subject of the interaction), anobject region ( i.e.,target of the interaction) and multi-label\nclassi\ufb01cation of the interaction types. One straightfor-\nward extension is to modify the MLP heads of DETR to\ntransform each positional embedding to predict a human\nbox, object box, and action classi\ufb01cation. However, this\narchitecture poses a problem where the localization for\nthe same object needs to be redundantly predicted with\nmultiple positional embeddings ( e.g., if the same person\nworks on a computer while sitting on a chair, two different\nqueries have to infer redundant regression for the same\nhuman).\n3.2. HOTR architecture\nThe overall pipeline of HOTR is illustrated in Figure 2.\nOur architecture features a transformer encoder-decoder\nstructure with a shared encoder and two parallel decoders\n(i.e., instance decoder and interaction decoder). The\nresults of the two decoders are associated with using our\nproposed HO Pointers to generate \ufb01nal HOI triplets. We\nwill introduce HO Pointers shortly after discussing the\narchitecture of HOTR.\nTransformer Encoder-Decoder architecture. Similar\nto DETR [2], the global context is extracted from the\ninput image by the backbone CNN and a shared encoder.\nAfterward, two sets of positional embeddings ( i.e., the\ninstance queries and the interaction queries) are fed into\nthe two parallel decoders ( i.e., the instance decoder and\ninteraction decoder in Fig. 2). The instance decoder trans-\nforms the instance queries to instance representations for\nobject detection while the interaction decoder transforms\nthe interaction queries to interaction representations for\nFigure 3. Conceptual illustration of how HO Pointers associates\nthe interaction representations with instance representations. As\ninstance representations are pre-trained to perform standard object\ndetection, the interaction representation learns localization by pre-\ndicting the pointer to the index of the instance representations for\neach human and object boxes. Note that the index pointer predic-\ntion is obtained in parallel with instance representations.\ninteraction detection. We apply feed-forward networks\n(FFNs) to the interaction representation and obtain a\nHuman Pointer, an Object Pointer, and interaction type,\nsee Fig. 3. In other words, the interaction representation\nlocalizes human and object regions by pointing the relevant\ninstance representations using the Human Pointer and\nObject Pointer (HO Pointers), instead of directly regressing\nthe bounding box. Our architecture has several advantages\ncompared to the direct regression approach. We found that\ndirectly regressing the bounding box has a problem when\nan object participates in multiple interactions. In the direct\nregression approach, the localization of the identical object\ndiffers across interactions. Our architecture addresses\nthis issue by having separate instance and interaction\nrepresentations and associating them using HO Pointers.\nAlso, our architecture allows learning the localization more\nef\ufb01ciently without the need of learning the localization re-\ndundantly for every interaction. Note that our experiments\nshow that our shared encoder is more effective to learn HO\nPointers than two separate encoders.\nHO Pointers. A conceptual overview of how HO Pointers\nassociate the parallel predictions from the instance decoder\nand the interaction decoder is illustrated in Figure 3. HO\nPointers ( i.e., Human Pointer and Object Pointer) contain\nthe indices of the corresponding instance representations of\nthe human and the object in the interaction. After the in-teraction decoder transforms Kinteraction queries to Kin-\nteraction representations, an interaction representation ziis\nfed into two feed-forward networks FFN h:Rd!Rd,\nFFNo:Rd!Rdto obtain vectors vh\niandvo\ni,i.e.,\nvh\ni=FFNh(zi)andvo\ni=FFNo(zi). Then \ufb01nally the Hu-\nman/Object Pointers ^ch\niand^co\ni, which are the indices of the\ninstance representations with the highest similarity scores,\nare obtained by\n^ch\ni= argmax\nj\u0000\nsim(vh\ni;\u0016j)\u0001\n;\n^co\ni= argmax\nj\u0000\nsim(vo\ni;\u0016j)\u0001\n;(1)\nwhere\u0016jis thej-th instance representation and\nsim(u;v) =u>v=kukkvk.\nRecomposition for HOI Set Prediction. From the previ-\nous steps, we now have the following: i) Ninstance rep-\nresentations \u0016, and ii)Kinteraction representations zand\ntheir HO Pointers ^chand^co. Given\rinteraction classes,\nour recomposition is to apply the feed-forward networks\nfor bounding box regression and action classi\ufb01cation as\nFFNbox:Rd!R4, and FFN act:Rd!R\r, respec-\ntively. Then, the \ufb01nal HOI prediction for the i-th interaction\nrepresentation ziis obtained by,\n^bh\ni=FFNbox(\u0016^ch\ni)2R4;\n^bo\ni=FFNbox(\u0016^co\ni)2R4;\n^ai=FFNact(zi)2R\r:(2)\nThe \ufb01nal HOI prediction by our HOTR is the set of K\ntriplets,fh^bh\ni;^bo\ni;^aiigK\ni=1.\nComplexity & Inference time. Previous parallel methods\nhave substituted the costly pair-wise neural network\ninference with a fast matching of triplets (associating\ninteraction regions with corresponding human regions and\nobject regions based on distance [30] or IoU [12]). HOTR\nfurther reduces the inference time after object detection\nby associating Kinteractions with Ninstances, resulting\nin a smaller time complexity O(KN). By eliminating\nthe post-processing stages in the previous one-stage HOI\ndetectors including NMS for the interaction region and\ntriplet matching, HOTR diminishes the inference time by\n4\u00188ms while showing improvement in performance.\n3.3. Training HOTR\nIn this section, we explain the details of HOTR training.\nWe \ufb01rst introduce the cost matrix of Hungarian Matching\nfor unique matching between the ground-truth HOI triplets\nand HOI set predictions obtained by recomposition. Then,\nusing the matching result, we de\ufb01ne the loss for HO\nPointers and the \ufb01nal training loss.\nHungarian Matching for HOI Detection. HOTR predicts\nKHOI triplets that consist of human box, object box and\nbinary classi\ufb01cation for the atypes of actions. Each predic-\ntion captures a unique hhuman,objectipair with one or more\ninteractions. Kis set to be larger than the typical number\nof interacting pairs in an image. We start with the basic cost\nfunction that de\ufb01nes an optimal bipartite matching between\npredicted and ground truth HOI triplets, and then show how\nwe modify this matching cost for our interaction represen-\ntations.\nLetYdenote the set of ground truth HOI triplets and\n^Y=f^yigK\ni=1as the set of Kpredictions. As Kis larger\nthan the number of unique interacting pairs in the image,\nwe considerYalso as a set of size Kpadded with ?(no\ninteraction). To \ufb01nd a bipartite matching between these two\nsets we search for a permutation of Kelements\u001b2SK\nwith the lowest cost:\n^\u001b= argmin\n\u001b2SKKX\niCmatch(yi;^y\u001b(i)); (3)\nwhereCmatch is a pair-wise matching cost between ground\ntruthyiand a prediction with index \u001b(i). However, since yi\nis in the form ofhhbox,obox,actioniand^y\u001b(i)is in the form\nofhhidx,oidx,actioni, we need to modify the cost function\nto compute the matching cost.\nLet\b :idx!box be a mapping function from ground-\ntruthhhidx,oidxito ground-truthhhbox,oboxiby optimal\nassignment for object detection. Using the inverse mapping\n\b\u00001:box!idx, we get the ground-truth idxfrom the\nground-truth box.\nLetM2Rd\u0002Nbe a set of normalized instance repre-\nsentations\u00160=\u0016=k\u0016k2Rd,i.e.,M= [\u00160\n1:::\u00160\nN]. We\ncompute ^Ph2RK\u0002Nthat is the set of softmax predictions\nfor the H Pointer in (1) given as\n^Ph=kK\ni=1softmax ((\u0016vh\ni)TM); (4)\nwherekK\ni=1denotes the vertical stack of row vectors and\n\u0016vh\ni=vh\ni=jjvh\nijj.^Pois analogously de\ufb01ned.\nGiven the ground-truth yi= (bh\ni;bo\ni;ai);^Ph;and;^Po,\nwe convert the ground-truth box to indices by ch\ni=\n\b\u00001(bh\ni)andco\ni= \b\u00001(bo\ni)and compute our matching cost\nfunction written as\nCmatch(yi;^y\u001b(i)) =\u0000\u000b\u0001 1fai6=?g^Ph[\u001b(i);ch\ni]\n\u0000\f\u0001 1fai6=?g^Po[\u001b(i);co\ni]\n+ 1fai6=?gLact(ai;^a\u001b(i));(5)\nwhere ^P[i;j]denotes the element at i-th row and j-th col-\numn, and ^a\u001b(i)is the predicted action. The action matchingcost is calculated as Lact(ai;^a\u001b(i)) = BCELoss (ai;^a\u001b(i)).\n\u000band\fis set as a \ufb01xed number to balance the different\nscales of the cost function for index prediction and action\nclassi\ufb01cation.\nFinal Set Prediction Loss for HOTR. We then compute the\nHungarian loss for all pairs matched above, where the loss\nfor the HOI triplets has the localization loss and the action\nclassi\ufb01cation loss as\nLH=KX\ni=1\u0002\nLloc(ch\ni;co\ni;z\u001b(i)) +Lact(ai;^a\u001b(i))\u0003\n: (6)\nThe localization loss Lloc(ch\ni;co\ni;z\u001b(i))is denoted as\nLloc=\u0000logexp( sim(FFNh(z\u001b(i));\u0016ch\ni)=\u001c)\nPN\nk=1exp( sim(FFNh(z\u001b(i));\u0016k)=\u001c)\n\u0000logexp( sim(FFNo(z\u001b(i));\u0016co\ni=\u001c)\nPN\nk=1exp( sim(FFNo(z\u001b(i));\u0016k)=\u001c);(7)\nwhere\u001cis the temperature that controls the smoothness of\nthe loss function. We empirically found that \u001c= 0:1is the\nbest value for our experiments.\nDe\ufb01ning No-Interaction with HOTR. In DETR [2],\nmaximizing the probability of the no-object class for\nthe softmax output naturally suppresses the probability\nof other classes. However, in HOI detection the action\nclassi\ufb01cation is a multi-label classi\ufb01cation where each\naction is treated as an individual binary classi\ufb01cation.\nDue to the absence of an explicit class that can suppress\nthe redundant predictions, HOTR ends up with multiple\npredictions for the same hhuman,objectipair. Therefore,\nHOTR sets an explicit class that learns the interactiveness\n(1 if there is anyinteraction between the pair, 0 otherwise),\nand suppresses the predictions for redundant pairs that\nhave a low interactiveness score (de\ufb01ned as No-Interaction\nclass). In our experiment in Table. 3, we show that setting\nan explicit class for interactiveness contributes to the \ufb01nal\nperformance.\nImplementation Details. We train HOTR with\nAdamW [22]. We set the transformer\u2019s initial learn-\ning rate to 10\u00004and weight decay to 10\u00004. All transformer\nweights are initialized with Xavier init [7]. For a fair\nevaluation with baselines, the Backbone, Encoder, and\nInstance Decoder are pre-trained in MS-COCO and frozen\nduring training. We use the scale augmentation as in\nDETR [2], resizing the input images such that the shortest\nside is at least 480 and at most 800 pixels while the longest\nside at most is 1333.\n4. Experiments\nIn this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour model in HOI detection. We \ufb01rst describe the two\npublic datasets that we use as our benchmark: V-COCO\nand HICO-DET. Next, we show that HOTR successfully\ncaptures HOI triplets, by achieving state-of-the-art perfor-\nmance in both mAP and inference time. Then, we provide\na detailed ablation study of the HOTR architecture.\n4.1. Datasets\nTo validate the performance of our model, we evaluate\nour model on two public benchmark datasets: the V-COCO\n(Verbs in COCO ) dataset and HICO-DET dataset. V-COCO\nis a subset of COCO and has 5,400 trainval images\nand 4,946 test images. For V-COCO dataset, we report\nthe AP roleover25interactions in two scenarios AP#1\nroleand\nAP#2\nrole. The two scenarios represent the different scoring\nways for object occlusion cases. In Scenario1, the model\nshould correctly predict the bounding box of the occluded\nobject as [0,0,0,0] while predicting human bounding box\nand actions correctly. In Scenario2, the model does not\nneed to predict about the occluded object. HICO-DET [3]\nis a subset of HICO dataset and has more than 150K an-\nnotated instances of human-object pairs in 47,051 images\n(37,536 training and 9,515 testing) and is annotated with\n600hverb;objectiinteraction types. For HICO-DET, we\nreport our performance in the Default setting where we\nevaluate the detection on the full test set. We follow the\nprevious settings and report the mAP over three different\ncategory sets: (1) all 600 HOI categories in HICO (Full),\n(2) 138 HOI categories with less than 10 training instances\n(Rare), and (3) 462 HOI categories with 10 or more training\ninstances (Non-Rare).\n4.2. Quantitative Analysis\nFor quantitative analysis, we use the of\ufb01cial evaluation\ncode for computing the performance of both V-COCO and\nHICO-DET. Table 1 and Table 2 show the comparison of\nHOTR with the latest HOI detectors including both se-\nquential and parallel methods. For fair comparison, the\ninstance detectors are \ufb01xed by the parameters pre-trained\nin MS-COCO. All results in V-COCO dataset are evalu-\nated with the \ufb01xed detector. For the HICO-DET dataset,\nwe provide both results using the \ufb01xed detector and the\n\ufb01ne-tuned detector following the common evaluation pro-\ntocol [1, 18, 10, 21, 4, 16, 12, 19].\nOur HOTR achieves a new state-of-the-art performance\non both V-COCO and HICO-DET datasets, while being\nthe fastest parallel detector. Table 1 shows our result\nin the V-COCO dataset with both Scenario1 and Sce-\nnario2.

Due to the noisy\nlabeling for objects in the HICO-DET dataset, \ufb01ne-tuning\nthe pre-trained object detector on the HICO-DET train set\nprovides a prior that bene\ufb01ts the overall performance [1].\nTherefore, we evaluate our performance in HICO-DET\ndataset under two conditions: i) using pre-trained weights\nfrom MS-COCO which are frozen during training (denoted\nas COCO in the Detector column) and ii) performance\nafter \ufb01ne-tuning the pre-trained detector on the HICO-DET\ntrain set (denoted as HICO-DET in the Detector column).\nOur model outperforms the state-of-the-art parallel HOI\ndetector under both conditions by a margin of 4:1mAP and\n4mAP, respectively.

The Detector column is denoted as \u2018COCO\u2019 for the models that freeze the object detectors\nwith the weights pre-trained in MS-COCO and \u2018HICO-DET\u2019 if the object detector is \ufb01ne-tuned with the HICO-DET train set.

HOTR\nshows state-of-the-art performance across both sequential\nand parallel HOI detectors in the Full evaluation for HICO-\nDET dataset (see Table. 2). However, HOTR underperforms\nthan baseline methods [16] in the Rare setting. Since this\nsetting deals with the action categories that has less than\n10 training instances, it is dif\ufb01cult to achieve accuracy onthis setting without the help of external features. There-\nfore, most of the studies that have shown high performance\nin Rare settings make use of additional information, such\nas spatial layouts [5], pose information [18], linguistic pri-\nors [17], and coherence patterns between the humans and\nobjects [16]. In this work, our method is a completely\nvision-based pipeline but if we include the prior knowledge,\nwe expect further improvement in the Rare setting.\nTime analysis. Since the inference time of the object detec-\ntor network (e.g., Faster-RCNN [25]) can vary depending\non benchmark settings (e.g., the library, CUDA, CUDNN\nversion or hyperparameters), the time analysis is based on\nthe pure inference time of the HOI interaction prediction\nmodel excluding the time of the object detection phase\nfor fair comparison with our model. For detailed analysis,\nHOTR takes an average of 36:3ms for the backbone and\nencoder, 23:8ms for the instance decoder and interaction\ndecoder (note that the two decoders run in parallel), and\n0:9ms for the recomposition and \ufb01nal HOI triplet inference.\nWe excluded the i/o times in all models including the time\nof previous models loading the RoI align features of Faster-\nRCNN (see Figure.1 for a speed vs time comparison).\nNote that our HOTR runs \u00025\u0018 \u0002 9faster compared to\nthe state-of-the-art parallel HOI detectors, since an explicit\npost-processing stage to assemble the detected objects\nand interaction regions is replaced with a simple O(KN)\nsearch to infer the HO Pointers.\n4.3.

Ablation Study on both V-COCO test set (scenario 1,\nAP#1\nrole) and HICO-DET test set (Default, Full setting without \ufb01ne-\ntuning the object detector)\nIn this section, we explore how each of the components\nof HOTR contributes to the \ufb01nal performance. Table 3\nshows the \ufb01nal performance in the V-COCO test set after\nexcluding each components of HOTR. We perform all\nexperiments with the most basic R50-C4 backbone, and\n\ufb01x the transformer layers to 6 and attention heads 8 and\nthe feed-forward network dimension to d= 1024 unless\notherwise mentioned.\nWith vs Without HO Pointers. In HOTR, the interaction\nrepresentation localizes human and object region by\npointing the relevant instance representations using the\nHuman Pointer and Object Pointer (HO Pointers), instead\nof directly regressing the bounding box. We pose that\nour architecture has advantages compared to the direct\nregression approach, since directly regressing the bounding\nbox for every interaction prediction requires redundant\nbounding box regression for the same object when an object\nparticipates in multiple interactions. Based on the perfor-\nmance gap ( 55:2!39:3in V-COCO and 23:5!17:2in\nHICO-DET), it can be concluded that using HO Pointers\nalleviates the issue of direct regression approach.\nShared Encoder vs Separate Encoders. From the Fig. 2,\nthe architecture having separate encoders for each Instance\nand Interaction Decoder can be considered. In this ablation,\nwe verify the role of the shared encoder of the HOTR. InTable 3, it is shown that sharing the encoder outperforms\nthe model with separate encoders by a margin of 21:3mAP\nand9:0mAP in V-COCO and HICO-DET, respectively.\nWe suppose the reason is that the shared encoder helps\nthe decoders learn common visual patterns, thus the HO\nPointers can share the overall context.\nWith vs Without Interactiveness Suppression. Unlike\nsoftmax based classi\ufb01cation where maximizing the prob-\nability for the no-object class can explicitly diminish\nthe probability of other classes, action classi\ufb01cation is\na multi-label binary classi\ufb01cation that treats each class\nindependently. So HOTR sets an explicit class that learns\ntheinteractiveness , and suppresses the predictions for\nredundant pairs that have low probability. Table 3 shows\nthat setting an explicit class for interactiveness contributes\n3mAP to the \ufb01nal performance.\n5. Conclusion\nIn this paper, we present HOTR, the \ufb01rst transformer-\nbased set prediction approach in human-object interaction\nproblem. The set prediction approach of HOTR eliminates\nthe hand-crafted post-processing steps of previous HOI\ndetectors while being able to model the correlations\nbetween interactions. We propose various training and\ninference techniques for HOTR: HOI decomposition with\nparallel decoders for training, recomposition layer based\non similarity for inference, and interactiveness suppression.\nWe develop a novel set-based matching for HOI detection\nthat associates the interaction representations to point at\ninstance representations. Our model achieves state-of-\nthe-art performance in two benchmark datasets in HOI\ndetection: V-COCO and HICO-DET, with a signi\ufb01cant\nmargin to previous parallel HOI detectors. HOTR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on both benchmark datasets\nin HOI detection with an inference time under 1 ms, being\nsigni\ufb01cantly faster than previous parallel HOI detectors\n(5\u00189 ms).\nAcknowledgments.

This Regulation ensures the free movement, cross-\nborder, of AI-based goods and services, thus preventing Member States from imposing \nrestrictions on the development, marketing and use of AI systems, unless explicitly \nauthorised by this Regulation.\n(2) This Regulation should be applied in accordance with the values of the Union enshrined \nas in the Charter, facilitating the protection of natural persons, undertakings, \ndemocracy, the rule of law and environmental protection, while boosting innovation and \nemployment and making the Union a leader in the uptake of trustworthy AI.\n(3)\u258c AI systems \u258c can be easily deployed in a large variety of sectors of the economy and \nmany parts of society, including across borders, and can easily circulate throughout the \nUnion. Certain Member States have already explored the adoption of national rules to \nensure that AI is trustworthy and safe and is developed and used in accordance with \nfundamental rights obligations. Diverging national rules may lead to the fragmentation of \nthe internal market and may decrease legal certainty for operators that develop, import or \nuse AI systems. A consistent and high level of protection throughout the Union should \ntherefore be ensured in order to achieve trustworthy AI, while divergences hampering the \nfree circulation, innovation, deployment and the uptake of AI systems and related \nproducts and services within the internal market should be prevented by laying down \nuniform obligations for operators and guaranteeing the uniform protection of overriding \nreasons of public interest and of rights of persons throughout the internal market on the \nbasis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). To \nthe extent that this Regulation contains specific rules on the protection of individuals with \nregard to the processing of personal data concerning restrictions of the use of AI systems \nfor remote biometric identification for the purpose of law enforcement, of the use of AI \nsystems for risk assessments of natural persons for the purpose of law enforcement and \nof the use of AI systems of biometric categorisation for the purpose of law enforcement, it \nis appropriate to base this Regulation, in so far as those specific rules are concerned, on \nArticle 16 TFEU. In light of those specific rules and the recourse to Article 16 TFEU, it is \nappropriate to consult the European Data Protection Board.\n(4) AI is a fast evolving family of technologies that contributes to a wide array of economic, \nenvironmental and societal benefits across the entire spectrum of industries and social \nactivities. By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and \npersonalising digital solutions available for individuals and organisations, the use of AI can \nprovide key competitive advantages to undertakings and support socially and \nenvironmentally beneficial outcomes, for example in healthcare, agriculture, food safety, \neducation and training, media, sports, culture, infrastructure management, energy, \ntransport and logistics, public services, security, justice, resource and energy efficiency, \nenvironmental monitoring, the conservation and restoration of biodiversity and \necosystems and climate change mitigation and adaptation.\n(5) At the same time, depending on the circumstances regarding its specific application, use, \nand level of technological development, AI may generate risks and cause harm to public \ninterests and fundamental rights that are protected by Union law. Such harm might be \nmaterial or immaterial, including physical, psychological, societal or economic harm.\n(6) Given the major impact that AI can have on society and the need to build trust, it is vital \nfor AI and its regulatory framework to be developed in accordance with Union values as \nenshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), the fundamental rights \nand freedoms enshrined in the Treaties and, pursuant to Article 6 TEU, the Charter. As \na pre-requisite, AI should be a human-centric technology. It should serve as a tool for \npeople, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well-being.\n(7) In order to ensure a consistent and high level of protection of public interests as regards \nhealth, safety and fundamental rights, common rules for high-risk AI systems should be \nestablished. Those rules should be consistent with the Charter, non-discriminatory and \nin line with the Union\u2019s international trade commitments. They should also take into \naccount the European Declaration on Digital Rights and Principles for the Digital \nDecade and the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI of the High-Level Expert Group on \nArtificial Intelligence (AI HLEG).\n(8) A Union legal framework laying down harmonised rules on AI is therefore needed to foster \nthe development, use and uptake of AI in the internal market that at the same time meets a \nhigh level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety and the protection of \nfundamental rights, including democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection \nas recognised and protected by Union law. To achieve that objective, rules regulating the \nplacing on the market, the putting into service and the use of certain AI systems should be \nlaid down, thus ensuring the smooth functioning of the internal market and allowing those \nsystems to benefit from the principle of free movement of goods and services. Those rules \nshould be clear and robust in protecting fundamental rights, supportive of new \ninnovative solutions, enabling a European ecosystem of public and private actors \ncreating AI systems in line with Union values and unlocking the potential of the digital \ntransformation across all regions of the Union. By laying down those rules as well as \nmeasures in support of innovation with a particular focus on small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs), including startups, this Regulation supports the objective of \npromoting the European human-centric approach to AI and being a global leader in the \ndevelopment of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI \u258c as stated by the European Council5, \nand it ensures the protection of ethical principles, as specifically requested by the European \nParliament6.\n5European Council, Special meeting of the European Council (1 and 2 October 2020) \u2013 \nConclusions, EUCO 13/20, 2020, p. 6.\n6European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the \nCommission on a framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related \ntechnologies, 2020/2012(INL).\n(9)Harmonised rules applicable to the placing on the market, the putting into service and the \nuse of high-risk AI systems should be laid down consistently with Regulation (EC) No \n765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council7, Decision No 768/2008/EC of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council8 and Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council9 (\u2018New Legislative Framework\u2019). The \nharmonised rules laid down in this Regulation should apply across sectors and, in line \nwith the New Legislative Framework, should be without prejudice to existing Union law, \nin particular on data protection, consumer protection, fundamental rights, employment, \nand protection of workers, and product safety, to which this Regulation is \ncomplementary. \n7Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 \nsetting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the \nmarketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, \np. 30).\n8Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on \na common framework for the marketing of products, and repealing Council Decision \n93/465/EEC (OJ L 218, 13.8.2008, p. 82).\n9Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 \non market surveillance and compliance of products and amending Directive 2004/42/EC and \nRegulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 305/2011 (Text with EEA relevance) (OJ L \n169, 25.6.2019, p. 1\u201344).\nAs a consequence all rights and remedies provided for by such Union law to consumers, and \nother persons on whom AI systems may have a negative impact, including as regards the \ncompensation of possible damages pursuant to Council Directive 85/374/EEC10 remain \nunaffected and fully applicable. Furthermore, in the context of employment and \nprotection of workers, this Regulation should therefore not affect Union law on social \npolicy and national labour law, in accordance with Union law, concerning employment \nand working conditions, including health and safety at work and the relationship \nbetween employers and workers. This Regulation should also not affect the exercise of \nfundamental rights as recognised in the Member States and at Union level, including the \nright or freedom to strike or to take other action covered by the specific industrial \nrelations systems in Member States as well as the right to negotiate, to conclude and \nenforce collective agreements or to take collective action in accordance with national \nlaw. \n10Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, \nregulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for \ndefective products (OJ L 210, 7.8.1985, p. 29).\nThis Regulation should not affect the provisions aiming to improve working conditions \nin platform work laid down in Directive (EU) 2024/\u2026 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council11+. Moreover, this Regulation aims to strengthen the effectiveness of such \nexisting rights and remedies by establishing specific requirements and obligations, \nincluding in respect of transparency, technical documentation and record-keeping of AI \nsystems. Furthermore, the obligations placed on various operators involved in the AI \nvalue chain under this Regulation should apply without prejudice to national law, in \naccordance with Union law, having the effect of limiting the use of certain AI systems \nwhere such law falls outside the scope of this Regulation or pursues other legitimate \npublic interest objectives than those pursued by this Regulation. For example, national \nlabour law and law on the protection of minors, namely persons below the age of 18, \ntaking into account the United Nations General Comment No 25 (2021) on children\u2019s \nrights in relation to the digital environment, insofar as they are not specific to AI systems \nand pursue other legitimate public interest objectives, should not be affected by this \nRegulation.\n11Directive (EU) 2024/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 on improving \nworking conditions in platform work (OJ L, \u2026, ELI: \u2026).\n+OJ: please, insert in the text the number of the Directive in PE XX/YY (2021/0414(COD)) \nand complete the corresponding footnote.\n(10) The fundamental right to the protection of personal data is safeguarded in particular by \nRegulations (EU) 2016/67912 and (EU) 2018/172513 of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council and Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil14. Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council15 \nadditionally protects private life and the confidentiality of communications, including by \nway of providing conditions for any storing of personal and non-personal data in and \naccess from terminal equipment. Those Union legal acts provide the basis for \nsustainable and responsible data processing, including where data sets include a mix of \npersonal and non-personal data. This Regulation does not seek to affect the application \nof existing Union law governing the processing of personal data, including the tasks and \npowers of the independent supervisory authorities competent to monitor compliance with \nthose instruments. \n12Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 \non the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the \nfree movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection \nRegulation) (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1).\n13Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October \n2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by \nthe Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, \nand repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, \n21.11.2018, p. 39).\n14Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on \nthe protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent \nauthorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of \ncriminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such \ndata, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89).\n15Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 \nconcerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic \ncommunications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, \n31.7.2002, p. 37).\nIt also does not affect the obligations of providers and deployers of AI systems in their \nrole as data controllers or processors stemming from Union or national law on the \nprotection of personal data in so far as the design, the development or the use of AI \nsystems involves the processing of personal data. It is also appropriate to clarify that \ndata subjects continue to enjoy all the rights and guarantees awarded to them by such \nUnion law, including the rights related to solely automated individual decision-making, \nincluding profiling. Harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into \nservice and the use of AI systems established under this Regulation should facilitate the \neffective implementation and enable the exercise of the data subjects\u2019 rights and other \nremedies guaranteed under Union law on the protection of personal data and of other \nfundamental rights.\n(11) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the provisions regarding the liability of \nintermediary service providers set out in Directive 2000/31/EC of the European \nParliament and of the Council16.\n16Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on \ncertain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in \nthe Internal Market ('Directive on electronic commerce') (OJ L 178, 17.7.2000, p. 1).\n(12) The notion of \u2018AI system\u2019 in this Regulation should be clearly defined and should be \nclosely aligned with the work of international organisations working on AI to ensure \nlegal certainty, facilitate international convergence and wide acceptance, while providing \nthe flexibility to accommodate the rapid technological developments in this field. \nMoreover, it should be based on key characteristics of AI systems that distinguish it from \nsimpler traditional software systems or programming approaches and should not cover \nsystems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically \nexecute operations. A key characteristic of AI systems is their capability to infer. This \ncapability to infer refers to the process of obtaining the outputs, such as predictions, \ncontent, recommendations, or decisions, which can influence physical and virtual \nenvironments, and to a capability of AI systems to derive models or algorithms from \ninputs or data. The techniques that enable inference while building an AI system include \nmachine learning approaches that learn from data how to achieve certain objectives, \nand logic- and knowledge-based approaches that infer from encoded knowledge or \nsymbolic representation of the task to be solved. The capacity of an AI system to infer \ntranscends basic data processing, enables learning, reasoning or modelling. The term \n\u2018machine-based\u2019 refers to the fact that AI systems run on machines. \nThe reference to explicit or implicit objectives underscores that AI systems can operate \naccording to explicit defined objectives or to implicit objectives. The objectives of the AI \nsystem may be different from the intended purpose of the AI system in a specific context. \nFor the purposes of this Regulation, environments should be understood to be the \ncontexts in which the AI systems operate, whereas outputs generated by the AI system \nreflect different functions performed by AI systems and include predictions, content, \nrecommendations or decisions. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of \nautonomy, meaning that they have some degree of independence of actions from human \ninvolvement and of capabilities to operate without human intervention. The adaptiveness \nthat an AI system could exhibit after deployment, refers to self-learning capabilities, \nallowing the system to change while in use. AI systems can be used on a stand-alone \nbasis or as a component of a product, irrespective of whether the system is physically \nintegrated into the product (embedded) or serve the functionality of the product without \nbeing integrated therein (non-embedded).\n(13) The notion of \u2018deployer\u2019 referred to in this Regulation should be interpreted as any \nnatural or legal person, including a public authority, agency or other body, using an AI \nsystem under its authority, except where the AI system is used in the course of a personal \nnon-professional activity. Depending on the type of AI system, the use of the system may \naffect persons other than the deployer.\n(14) The notion of \u2018biometric data\u2019 used in this Regulation \u258c should be interpreted in light of \nthe notion of biometric data as defined in Article 4, point (14) of Regulation (EU) \n2016/679, Article 3, point (18) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and Article 3, point (13) of \nDirective (EU) 2016/680. Biometric data can allow for the authentication, identification \nor categorisation of natural persons and for the recognition of emotions of natural \npersons.\n(15) The notion of \u2018biometric identification\u2019 referred to in this Regulation should be defined \nas the automated recognition of physical, physiological and behavioural human features \nsuch as the face, eye movement, body shape, voice, prosody, gait, posture, heart rate, \nblood pressure, odour, keystrokes characteristics, for the purpose of establishing an \nindividual\u2019s identity by comparing biometric data of that individual to stored biometric \ndata of individuals in a reference database, irrespective of whether the individual has \ngiven its consent or not. This excludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric \nverification, which includes authentication, whose sole purpose is to confirm that a \nspecific natural person is the person he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of \na natural person for the sole purpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or \nhaving security access to premises.\n(16) The notion of \u2018biometric categorisation\u2019 referred to in this Regulation should be defined \nas assigning natural persons to specific categories on the basis of their biometric data. \nSuch specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, eye colour, \ntattoos, behavioural or personality traits, language, religion, membership of a national \nminority, sexual or political orientation. This does not include biometric categorisation \nsystems that are a purely ancillary feature intrinsically linked to another commercial \nservice meaning that the feature cannot, for objective technical reasons, be used without \nthe principal service and the integration of that feature or functionality is not a means to \ncircumvent the applicability of the rules of this Regulation. For example, filters \ncategorising facial or body features used on online marketplaces could constitute such \nan ancillary feature as they can be used only in relation to the principal service which \nconsists in selling a product by allowing the consumer to preview the display of the \nproduct on him or herself and help the consumer to make a purchase decision. Filters \nused on online social network services which categorise facial or body features to allow \nusers to add or modify pictures or videos could also be considered to be ancillary feature \nas such filter cannot be used without the principal service of the social network services \nconsisting in the sharing of content online.\n(17) The notion of \u2018remote biometric identification system\u2019 referred to in this Regulation should \nbe defined functionally, as an AI system intended for the identification of natural persons \nwithout their active involvement, typically at a distance, through the comparison of a \nperson\u2019s biometric data with the biometric data contained in a reference database, \nirrespectively of the particular technology, processes or types of biometric data used. \nSuch remote biometric identification systems are typically used to perceive multiple \npersons or their behaviour simultaneously in order to facilitate significantly the \nidentification of natural persons without their active involvement. This excludes AI \nsystems intended to be used for biometric verification, which includes authentication, the \nsole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person is the person he or she \nclaims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole purpose of \nhaving access to a service, unlocking a device or having security access to premises. \nThat exclusion is justified by the fact that such systems are likely to have a minor impact \non fundamental rights of natural persons compared to the remote biometric \nidentification systems which may be used for the processing of the biometric data of a \nlarge number of persons without their active involvement. In the case of \u2018real-time\u2019 \nsystems, the capturing of the biometric data, the comparison and the identification occur all \ninstantaneously, near-instantaneously or in any event without a significant delay. In this \nregard, there should be no scope for circumventing the rules of this Regulation on the \u2018real-\ntime\u2019 use of the AI systems concerned by providing for minor delays. \u2018Real-time\u2019 systems \ninvolve the use of \u2018live\u2019 or \u2018near-live\u2019 material, such as video footage, generated by a \ncamera or other device with similar functionality. In the case of \u2018post\u2019 systems, in contrast, \nthe biometric data have already been captured and the comparison and identification occur \nonly after a significant delay. This involves material, such as pictures or video footage \ngenerated by closed circuit television cameras or private devices, which has been generated \nbefore the use of the system in respect of the natural persons concerned.\n(18) The notion of \u2018emotion recognition system\u2019 referred to in this Regulation should be \ndefined as an AI system for the purpose of identifying or inferring emotions or \nintentions of natural persons on the basis of their biometric data. The notion refers to \nemotions or intentions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, disgust, \nembarrassment, excitement, shame, contempt, satisfaction and amusement. It does not \ninclude physical states, such as pain or fatigue; this refers for example to systems used \nin detecting the state of fatigue of professional pilots or drivers for the purpose of \npreventing accidents. This does also not include the mere detection of readily apparent \nexpressions, gestures or movements, unless they are used for identifying or inferring \nemotions. Those expressions can be basic facial expressions, such as a frown or a smile, \nor gestures such as the movement of hands, arms or head, or characteristics of a \nperson\u2019s voice, such as a raised voice or whispering.\n(19) For the purposes of this Regulation the notion of \u2018publicly accessible space\u2019 should be \nunderstood as referring to any physical place that is accessible to an undetermined \nnumber of natural persons, and irrespective of whether the place in question is privately \nor publicly owned, irrespective of the activity for which the place may be used, such as \ncommerce (for instance, shops, restaurants, caf\u00e9s), services (for instance, banks, \nprofessional activities, hospitality), sport (for instance, swimming pools, gyms, stadiums), \ntransport (for instance, bus, metro and railway stations, airports, means of transport ), \nentertainment (for instance, cinemas, theatres, museums, concert and conference halls), \nor leisure or otherwise (for instance, public roads and squares, parks, forests, \nplaygrounds). A place should be classified as publicly accessible also if, regardless of \npotential capacity or security restrictions, access is subject to certain predetermined \nconditions, which can be fulfilled by an undetermined number of persons, such as \npurchase of a ticket or title of transport, prior registration or having a certain age. In \ncontrast, a place should not be considered to be publicly accessible if access is limited to \nspecific and defined natural persons through either Union or national law directly \nrelated to public safety or security or through the clear manifestation of will by the \nperson having the relevant authority on the place. The factual possibility of access alone \n(such as an unlocked door or an open gate in a fence) does not imply that the place is \npublicly accessible in the presence of indications or circumstances suggesting the \ncontrary (such as. signs prohibiting or restricting access). Company and factory \npremises, as well as offices and workplaces that are intended to be accessed only by \nrelevant employees and service providers, are places that are not publicly accessible. \nPublicly accessible spaces should not include prisons or border control. Some other \nareas may be composed of both not publicly accessible and publicly accessible areas, \nsuch as the hallway of a private residential building necessary to access a doctor's office \nor an airport. Online spaces are not covered either, as they are not physical spaces. \nWhether a given space is accessible to the public should however be determined on a case-\nby-case basis, having regard to the specificities of the individual situation at hand.\n(20) In order to obtain the greatest benefits from AI systems while protecting fundamental \nrights, health and safety and to enable democratic control, AI literacy should equip \nproviders, deployers and affected persons with the necessary notions to make informed \ndecisions regarding AI systems. Those notions may vary with regard to the relevant \ncontext and can include understanding the correct application of technical elements \nduring the AI system\u2019s development phase, the measures to be applied during its use, the \nsuitable ways in which to interpret the AI system\u2019s output, and, in the case of affected \npersons, the knowledge necessary to understand how decisions taken with the assistance \nof AI will have an impact on them. In the context of the application this Regulation, AI \nliteracy should provide all relevant actors in the AI value chain with the insights \nrequired to ensure the appropriate compliance and its correct enforcement. \nFurthermore, the wide implementation of AI literacy measures and the introduction of \nappropriate follow-up actions could contribute to improving working conditions and \nultimately sustain the consolidation, and innovation path of trustworthy AI in the Union. \nThe European Artificial Intelligence Board (the \u2018Board\u2019) should support the \nCommission, to promote AI literacy tools, public awareness and understanding of the \nbenefits, risks, safeguards, rights and obligations in relation to the use of AI systems. In \ncooperation with the relevant stakeholders, the Commission and the Member States \nshould facilitate the drawing up of voluntary codes of conduct to advance AI literacy \namong persons dealing with the development, operation and use of AI.\n(21) In order to ensure a level playing field and an effective protection of rights and freedoms of \nindividuals across the Union, the rules established by this Regulation should apply to \nproviders of AI systems in a non-discriminatory manner, irrespective of whether they are \nestablished within the Union or in a third country, and to deployers of AI systems \nestablished within the Union.\n(22) In light of their digital nature, certain AI systems should fall within the scope of this \nRegulation even when they are not placed on the market, put into service, or used in the \nUnion. This is the case, for example, where an operator established in the Union contracts \ncertain services to an operator established in a third country in relation to an activity to be \nperformed by an AI system that would qualify as high-risk \u258c . In those circumstances, the \nAI system used in a third country by the operator could process data lawfully collected in \nand transferred from the Union, and provide to the contracting operator in the Union the \noutput of that AI system resulting from that processing, without that AI system being \nplaced on the market, put into service or used in the Union. To prevent the circumvention \nof this Regulation and to ensure an effective protection of natural persons located in the \nUnion, this Regulation should also apply to providers and deployers of AI systems that are \nestablished in a third country, to the extent the output produced by those systems is \nintended to be used in the Union. \nNonetheless, to take into account existing arrangements and special needs for future \ncooperation with foreign partners with whom information and evidence is exchanged, this \nRegulation should not apply to public authorities of a third country and international \norganisations when acting in the framework of cooperation or international agreements \nconcluded at Union or national level for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the \nUnion or the Member States, provided that the relevant third country or international \norganisations provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of \nfundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. Where relevant, this may cover \nactivities of entities entrusted by the third countries to carry out specific tasks in support \nof such law enforcement and judicial cooperation. Such framework for cooperation or \nagreements have been established bilaterally between Member States and third countries \nor between the European Union, Europol and other Union agencies and third countries and \ninternational organisations. The authorities competent for supervision of the law \nenforcement and judicial authorities under this Regulation should assess whether those \nframeworks for cooperation or international agreements include adequate safeguards \nwith respect to the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals. \nRecipient Member States authorities and Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies \nmaking use of such outputs in the Union remain accountable to ensure their use \ncomplies with Union law. When those international agreements are revised or new ones \nare concluded in the future, the contracting parties should undertake the utmost effort to \nalign those agreements with the requirements of this Regulation.\n(23) This Regulation should also apply to Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies when \nacting as a provider or deployer of an AI system. \u258c\n(24) If and insofar AI systems are placed on the market, put into service, or used with or \nwithout modification of such systems for military, defence or national security purposes, \nthose should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation regardless of which type of \nentity is carrying out those activities, such as whether it is a public or private entity. As \nregards military and defence purposes, such exclusion is justified both by Article 4(2) \nTEU and by the specificities of the Member States\u2019 and the common Union defence \npolicy covered by Chapter 2 of Title V TEU that are subject to public international law, \nwhich is therefore the more appropriate legal framework for the regulation of AI \nsystems in the context of the use of lethal force and other AI systems in the context of \nmilitary and defence activities. As regards national security purposes, the exclusion is \njustified both by the fact that national security remains the sole responsibility of Member \nStates in accordance with Article 4(2) TEU and by the specific nature and operational \nneeds of national security activities and specific national rules applicable to those \nactivities. Nonetheless, if an AI system developed, placed on the market, put into service \nor used for military, defence or national security purposes is used outside those \ntemporarily or permanently for other purposes, for example, civilian or humanitarian \npurposes, law enforcement or public security purposes, such a system would fall within \nthe scope of this Regulation. \nIn that case, the entity using the system for other than military, defence or national \nsecurity purposes should ensure compliance of the system with this Regulation, unless \nthe system is already compliant with this Regulation. AI systems placed on the market or \nput into service for an excluded purpose, namely military, defence or national security, \nand one or more non-excluded purposes, such as civilian purposes or law enforcement, \nfall within the scope of this Regulation and providers of those systems should ensure \ncompliance with this Regulation. In those cases, the fact that an AI system may fall \nwithin the scope of this Regulation should not affect the possibility of entities carrying \nout national security, defence and military activities, regardless of the type of entity \ncarrying out those activities, to use AI systems for national security, military and defence \npurposes, the use of which is excluded from the scope of this Regulation. An AI system \nplaced on the market for civilian or law enforcement purposes which is used with or \nwithout modification for military, defence or national security purposes should not fall \nwithin the scope of this Regulation, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those \nactivities.\n(25) This Regulation should support innovation, respect freedom of science, and should not \nundermine research and development activity. It is therefore necessary to exclude from \nits scope AI systems and models specifically developed and put into service for the sole \npurpose of scientific research and development. Moreover, it is necessary to ensure that \nthis Regulation does not otherwise affect scientific research and development activity on \nAI systems or models prior to being placed on the market or put into service. As regards \nproduct oriented research, testing and development activity regarding AI systems or \nmodels, the provisions of this Regulation should also not apply prior to those systems \nand models being put into service or placed on the market. That exclusion is without \nprejudice to the obligation to comply with this Regulation where an AI system falling \ninto the scope of this Regulation is placed on the market or put into service as a result of \nsuch research and development activity and to the application of provisions on \nregulatory sandboxes and testing in real world conditions. Furthermore, without \nprejudice to exclusion regarding AI systems specifically developed and put into service \nfor the sole purpose of scientific research and development, any other AI system that \nmay be used for the conduct of any research and development activity should remain \nsubject to the provisions of this Regulation. In any event, any research and development \nactivity should be carried out in accordance with recognised ethical and professional \nstandards for scientific research and should be conducted in accordance with applicable \nUnion law.\n(26) In order to introduce a proportionate and effective set of binding rules for AI systems, a \nclearly defined risk-based approach should be followed. That approach should tailor the \ntype and content of such rules to the intensity and scope of the risks that AI systems can \ngenerate. It is therefore necessary to prohibit certain unacceptable AI practices, to lay \ndown requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for the relevant operators, and \nto lay down transparency obligations for certain AI systems.\n(27) While the risk-based approach is the basis for a proportionate and effective set of \nbinding rules, it is important to recall the 2019 Ethics guidelines for trustworthy AI \ndeveloped by the independent AI HLEG appointed by the Commission. In those \nguidelines, the AI HLEG developed seven non-binding ethical principles for AI which \nare intended to help ensure that AI is trustworthy and ethically sound. The seven \nprinciples include human agency and oversight; technical robustness and safety; privacy \nand data governance; transparency; diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; societal \nand environmental well-being and accountability. Without prejudice to the legally \nbinding requirements of this Regulation and any other applicable Union law, those \nguidelines contribute to the design of a coherent, trustworthy and human-centric AI, in \nline with the Charter and with the values on which the Union is founded. According to \nthe guidelines of the AI HLEG, human agency and oversight means that AI systems are \ndeveloped and used as a tool that serves people, respects human dignity and personal \nautonomy, and that is functioning in a way that can be appropriately controlled and \noverseen by humans. \nTechnical robustness and safety means that AI systems are developed and used in a way \nthat allows robustness in the case of problems and resilience against attempts to alter the \nuse or performance of the AI system so as to allow unlawful use by third parties, and \nminimise unintended harm. Privacy and data governance means that AI systems are \ndeveloped and used in accordance with privacy and data protection rules, while \nprocessing data that meets high standards in terms of quality and integrity. \nTransparency means that AI systems are developed and used in a way that allows \nappropriate traceability and explainability, while making humans aware that they \ncommunicate or interact with an AI system, as well as duly informing deployers of the \ncapabilities and limitations of that AI system and affected persons about their rights. \nDiversity, non-discrimination and fairness means that AI systems are developed and \nused in a way that includes diverse actors and promotes equal access, gender equality \nand cultural diversity, while avoiding discriminatory impacts and unfair biases that are \nprohibited by Union or national law. Social and environmental well-being means that AI \nsystems are developed and used in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner as \nwell as in a way to benefit all human beings, while monitoring and assessing the long-\nterm impacts on the individual, society and democracy. The application of those \nprinciples should be translated, when possible, in the design and use of AI models. They \nshould in any case serve as a basis for the drafting of codes of conduct under this \nRegulation. All stakeholders, including industry, academia, civil society and \nstandardisation organisations, are encouraged to take into account as appropriate the \nethical principles for the development of voluntary best practices and standards.\n(28) Aside from the many beneficial uses of AI, that technology can also be misused and \nprovide novel and powerful tools for manipulative, exploitative and social control \npractices. Such practices are particularly harmful and abusive and should be prohibited \nbecause they contradict Union values of respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, \ndemocracy and the rule of law and fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, including \nthe right to non-discrimination, to data protection and to privacy and the rights of the child.\n(29)AI-enabled manipulative techniques can be used to persuade persons to engage in \nunwanted behaviours, or to deceive them by nudging them into decisions in a way that \nsubverts and impairs their autonomy, decision-making and free choices. The placing on \nthe market, the putting into service or the use of certain AI systems with the objective to or \nthe effect of materially distorting human behaviour, whereby significant harms, in \nparticular having sufficiently important adverse impacts on physical, psychological \nhealth or financial interests are likely to occur, are particularly dangerous and should \ntherefore be forbidden. Such AI systems deploy subliminal components such as audio, \nimage, video stimuli that persons cannot perceive as those stimuli are beyond human \nperception or other manipulative or deceptive techniques that subvert or impair person\u2019s \nautonomy, decision-making or free choice in ways that people are not consciously aware \nor, where they are aware, they are still deceived or are not able to control or resist. This \ncould be facilitated, for example, by machine-brain interfaces or virtual reality as they \nallow for a higher degree of control of what stimuli are presented to persons, insofar as \nthey may materially distort their behaviour in a significantly harmful manner. In \naddition, AI systems may also otherwise exploit the vulnerabilities of a person or a \nspecific group of persons due to their age, disability within the meaning of Directive (EU) \n2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council17, or a specific social or \neconomic situation that is likely to make those persons more vulnerable to exploitation \nsuch as persons living in extreme poverty, ethnic or religious minorities. \n17Directive (EU) 2019/882 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on \nthe accessibility requirements for products and services (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 70).\nSuch AI systems can be placed on the market, put into service or used with the objective \nto or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person and in a manner that \ncauses or is reasonably likely to cause significant harm to that or another person or groups \nof persons, including harms that may be accumulated over time and should therefore be \nprohibited. It may not be possible to assume that there is an intention to distort behaviour \nwhere the distortion \u258c results from factors external to the AI system which are outside the \ncontrol of the provider or the deployer, namely factors that may not be reasonably \nforeseeable and therefore not possible for the provider or the deployer of the AI system \nto mitigate. In any case, it is not necessary for the provider or the deployer to have the \nintention to cause significant harm, provided that such harm results from the \nmanipulative or exploitative AI-enabled practices. The prohibitions for such AI practices \nare complementary to the provisions contained in Directive 2005/29/EC of the European \nParliament and of the Council18, in particular unfair commercial practices leading to \neconomic or financial harms to consumers are prohibited under all circumstances, \nirrespective of whether they are put in place through AI systems or otherwise. The \nprohibitions of manipulative and exploitative practices in this Regulation should not \naffect lawful practices in the context of medical treatment such as psychological \ntreatment of a mental disease or physical rehabilitation, when those practices are carried \nout in accordance with the applicable law and medical standards, for example explicit \nconsent of the individuals or their legal representatives. In addition, common and \nlegitimate commercial practices, for example in the field of advertising, that comply with \nthe applicable law should not, in themselves, be regarded as constituting harmful \nmanipulative AI practices.\n18Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 \nconcerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and \namending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council (\u2018Unfair Commercial Practices Directive\u2019) (OJ L \n149, 11.6.2005, p. 22).\n(30) Biometric categorisation systems that are based on natural persons\u2019 biometric data, such \nas an individual person\u2019s face or fingerprint, to deduce or infer an individuals\u2019 political \nopinions, trade union membership, religious or philosophical beliefs, race, sex life or \nsexual orientation should be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover the lawful \nlabelling, filtering or categorisation of biometric data sets acquired in line with Union or \nnational law according to biometric data, such as the sorting of images according to hair \ncolour or eye colour, which can for example be used in the area of law enforcement.\n(31) AI systems providing social scoring of natural persons \u258c by public or private actors may \nlead to discriminatory outcomes and the exclusion of certain groups. They may violate the \nright to dignity and non-discrimination and the values of equality and justice. Such AI \nsystems evaluate or classify natural persons or groups thereof on the basis of multiple \ndata points related to their social behaviour in multiple contexts or known, inferred or \npredicted personal or personality characteristics over certain periods of time. The social \nscore obtained from such AI systems may lead to the detrimental or unfavourable \ntreatment of natural persons or whole groups thereof in social contexts, which are unrelated \nto the context in which the data was originally generated or collected or to a detrimental \ntreatment that is disproportionate or unjustified to the gravity of their social behaviour. AI \nsystems entailing such unacceptable scoring practices and leading to such detrimental or \nunfavourable outcomes should be therefore prohibited. That prohibition should not affect \nlawful evaluation practices of natural persons that are carried out for a specific purpose \nin accordance with Union and national law.\n(32) The use of AI systems for \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification of natural persons in \npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement is particularly intrusive to \nthe rights and freedoms of the concerned persons, to the extent that it may affect the \nprivate life of a large part of the population, evoke a feeling of constant surveillance and \nindirectly dissuade the exercise of the freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights. \nTechnical inaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of \nnatural persons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. Such \npossible biased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to \nage, ethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. In addition, the immediacy of the impact and the \nlimited opportunities for further checks or corrections in relation to the use of such systems \noperating in real-time carry heightened risks for the rights and freedoms of the persons that \nare concerned by law enforcement activities.\n(33) The use of those systems for the purpose of law enforcement should therefore be \nprohibited, except in exhaustively listed and narrowly defined situations, where the use is \nstrictly necessary to achieve a substantial public interest, the importance of which \noutweighs the risks. Those situations involve the search for certain victims of crime \u258c \nincluding missing people; certain threats to the life or to the physical safety of natural \npersons or of a terrorist attack; and the localisation or identification of perpetrators or \nsuspects of the criminal offences listed in an annex to this Regulation, where those \ncriminal offences are punishable by a custodial sentence or a detention order for a \nmaximum period of at least four years in the Member State concerned in accordance with \nthe law of that Member State. Such a threshold for the custodial sentence or detention \norder in accordance with national law contributes to ensuring that the offence should be \nserious enough to potentially justify the use of \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification \nsystems. \nMoreover, those criminal offences are based on the 32 criminal offences listed in the \nCouncil Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA19, taking into account that some of those \noffences are, in practice, likely to be more relevant than others, in that the recourse to \u2018real-\ntime\u2019 remote biometric identification is, foreseeably, necessary and proportionate to highly \nvarying degrees for the practical pursuit of the localisation or identification of a \nperpetrator or suspect of the different criminal offences listed and having regard to the \nlikely differences in the seriousness, probability and scale of the harm or possible negative \nconsequences. An imminent threat to life or the physical safety of natural persons could \nalso result from a serious disruption of critical infrastructure, as defined in Article 2, \npoint (4) of Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council20, \nwhere the disruption or destruction of such critical infrastructure would result in an \nimminent threat to life or the physical safety of a person, including through serious \nharm to the provision of basic supplies to the population or to the exercise of the core \nfunction of the State. In addition, this Regulation should preserve the ability for law \nenforcement, border control, immigration or asylum authorities to carry out identity \nchecks in the presence of the person that is concerned in accordance with the conditions \nset out in Union and national law for such checks. In particular, law enforcement, \nborder control, immigration or asylum authorities should be able to use information \nsystems, in accordance with Union or national law, to identify persons who, during an \nidentity check, either refuse to be identified or are unable to state or prove their identity, \nwithout being required by this Regulation to obtain prior authorisation. This could be, \nfor example, a person involved in a crime, being unwilling, or unable due to an accident \nor a medical condition, to disclose their identity to law enforcement authorities.\n19Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest \nwarrant and the surrender procedures between Member States (OJ L 190, 18.7.2002, p. 1).\n20Directive (EU) 2022/2557 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December \n2022 on the resilience of critical entities and repealing Council Directive 2008/114/EC (OJ \nL 333, 27.12.2022, p. 164).\n(34) In order to ensure that those systems are used in a responsible and proportionate manner, it \nis also important to establish that, in each of those exhaustively listed and narrowly defined \nsituations, certain elements should be taken into account, in particular as regards the nature \nof the situation giving rise to the request and the consequences of the use for the rights and \nfreedoms of all persons concerned and the safeguards and conditions provided for with the \nuse. In addition, the use of \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification systems in publicly \naccessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be deployed only to confirm \nthe specifically targeted individual\u2019s identity and should be limited to what is strictly \nnecessary concerning the period of time as well as geographic and personal scope, \nhaving regard in particular to the evidence or indications regarding the threats, the victims \nor perpetrator. The use of the real-time remote biometric identification system in publicly \naccessible spaces should be authorised only if the relevant law enforcement authority \nhas completed a fundamental rights impact assessment and, unless provided otherwise in \nthis Regulation, has registered the system in the database as set out in this Regulation. \nThe reference database of persons should be appropriate for each use case in each of the \nsituations mentioned above.\n(35) Each use of a \u2018real-time\u2019 remote biometric identification system in publicly accessible \nspaces for the purpose of law enforcement should be subject to an express and specific \nauthorisation by a judicial authority or by an independent administrative authority whose \ndecision is binding of a Member State. Such authorisation should, in principle, be obtained \nprior to the use of the AI system with a view to identifying a person or persons. \nExceptions to that rule should be allowed in duly justified situations on grounds of \nurgency, namely, in situations where the need to use the systems concerned is such as to \nmake it effectively and objectively impossible to obtain an authorisation before \ncommencing the use of the AI system. In such situations of urgency, the use of the AI \nsystem should be restricted to the absolute minimum necessary and should be subject to \nappropriate safeguards and conditions, as determined in national law and specified in the \ncontext of each individual urgent use case by the law enforcement authority itself. In \naddition, the law enforcement authority should in such situations request such \nauthorisation \u258c while providing the reasons for not having been able to request it earlier, \nwithout undue delay and, at the latest within 24 hours. If such an authorisation is \nrejected, the use of real-time biometric identification systems linked to that authorisation \nshould cease with immediate effect and all the data related to such use should be \ndiscarded and deleted. Such data includes input data directly acquired by an AI system \nin the course of the use of such system as well as the results and outputs of the use \nlinked to that authorisation. It should not include input that is legally acquired in \naccordance with another Union or national law. In any case, no decision producing an \nadverse legal effect on a person should be taken based solely on the output of the remote \nbiometric identification system.\n(36) In order to carry out their tasks in accordance with the requirements set out in this \nRegulation as well as in national rules, the relevant market surveillance authority and \nthe national data protection authority should be notified of each use of the real-time \nbiometric identification system. National market surveillance authorities and the \nnational data protection authorities that have been notified should submit to the \nCommission an annual report on the use of real-time biometric identification systems.\n(37) Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide, within the exhaustive framework set by this \nRegulation that such use in the territory of a Member State in accordance with this \nRegulation should only be possible where and in as far as the Member State concerned has \ndecided to expressly provide for the possibility to authorise such use in its detailed rules of \nnational law. Consequently, Member States remain free under this Regulation not to \nprovide for such a possibility at all or to only provide for such a possibility in respect of \nsome of the objectives capable of justifying authorised use identified in this Regulation. \nSuch national rules should be notified to the Commission within 30 days of their \nadoption.\n(38) The use of AI systems for real-time remote biometric identification of natural persons in \npublicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law enforcement necessarily involves the \nprocessing of biometric data. The rules of this Regulation that prohibit, subject to certain \nexceptions, such use, which are based on Article 16 TFEU, should apply as lex specialis in \nrespect of the rules on the processing of biometric data contained in Article 10 of Directive \n(EU) 2016/680, thus regulating such use and the processing of biometric data involved in \nan exhaustive manner. Therefore, such use and processing should be possible only in as far \nas it is compatible with the framework set by this Regulation, without there being scope, \noutside that framework, for the competent authorities, where they act for purpose of law \nenforcement, to use such systems and process such data in connection thereto on the \ngrounds listed in Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. In that context, this Regulation is \nnot intended to provide the legal basis for the processing of personal data under Article 8 \nof Directive (EU) 2016/680. However, the use of real-time remote biometric identification \nsystems in publicly accessible spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, including \nby competent authorities, should not be covered by the specific framework regarding such \nuse for the purpose of law enforcement set by this Regulation. Such use for purposes other \nthan law enforcement should therefore not be subject to the requirement of an authorisation \nunder this Regulation and the applicable detailed rules of national law that may give effect \nto that authorisation.\n(39) Any processing of biometric data and other personal data involved in the use of AI systems \nfor biometric identification, other than in connection to the use of real-time remote \nbiometric identification systems in publicly accessible spaces for the purpose of law \nenforcement as regulated by this Regulation, should continue to comply with all \nrequirements resulting from Article 10 of Directive (EU) 2016/680. For purposes other \nthan law enforcement, \u258c Article 9(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(1) of \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725 prohibit the processing of biometric data subject to limited \nexceptions as provided in those Articles. In the application of Article 9(1) of Regulation \n(EU) 2016/679, the use of remote biometric identification for purposes other than law \nenforcement has already been subject to prohibition decisions by national data \nprotection authorities.\n(40) In accordance with Article 6a of Protocol No 21 on the position of the United Kingdom \nand Ireland in respect of the area of freedom, security and justice, as annexed to the TEU \nand to the TFEU, Ireland is not bound by the rules laid down in Article 5(1), point (c) to \nthe extent it applies to the use of biometric categorisation systems for activities in the \nfield of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Article 5(1), \npoints (e) and (f) to the extent they apply to the use of AI systems covered by that \nprovision, Article 5(3) to (8) and Article 26(10) of this Regulation adopted on the basis of \nArticle 16 of the TFEU which relate to the processing of personal data by the Member \nStates when carrying out activities falling within the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of \nTitle V of Part Three of the TFEU, where Ireland is not bound by the rules governing the \nforms of judicial cooperation in criminal matters or police cooperation which require \ncompliance with the provisions laid down on the basis of Article 16 TFEU.\n(41) In accordance with Articles 2 and 2a of Protocol No 22 on the position of Denmark, \nannexed to the TEU and to the TFEU, Denmark is not bound by rules laid down in Article \n5(1), point (c) to the extent it applies to the use of biometric categorisation systems for \nactivities in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, \nArticle 5(1), point (e), point (f) to the extent it applies to the use of AI systems covered by \nthat provision, Article 5(3) to (8) and Article 26(10) of this Regulation adopted on the \nbasis of Article 16 of the TFEU, or subject to their application, which relate to the \nprocessing of personal data by the Member States when carrying out activities falling \nwithin the scope of Chapter 4 or Chapter 5 of Title V of Part Three of the TFEU.\n(42) In line with the presumption of innocence, natural persons in the Union should always \nbe judged on their actual behaviour. Natural persons should never be judged on AI-\npredicted behaviour based solely on their profiling, personality traits or characteristics, \nsuch as nationality, place of birth, place of residence, number of children, level of debt \nor type of car, without a reasonable suspicion of that person being involved in a criminal \nactivity based on objective verifiable facts and without human assessment thereof. \nTherefore, risk assessments carried out with regard to natural persons in order to assess \nthe risk of their offending or to predict the occurrence of an actual or potential criminal \noffence based solely on profiling them or on assessing their personality traits and \ncharacteristics should be prohibited. In any case, that prohibition does not refer to or \ntouch upon risk analytics that are not based on the profiling of individuals or on the \npersonality traits and characteristics of individuals, such as AI systems using risk \nanalytics to assess the risk of financial fraud by undertakings on the basis of suspicious \ntransactions or risk analytic tools to predict the likelihood of the localisation of narcotics \nor illicit goods by customs authorities, for example on the basis of known trafficking \nroutes.\n(43) The placing on the market, the putting into service for this specific purpose, or use of AI \nsystems that create or expand facial recognition databases through the untargeted \nscraping of facial images from the internet or CCTV footage, should be prohibited \nbecause that practice adds to the feeling of mass surveillance and can lead to gross \nviolations of fundamental rights, including the right to privacy.\n(44) There are serious concerns about the scientific basis of AI systems aiming to identify or \ninfer emotions, particularly as expression of emotions vary considerably across cultures \nand situations, and even within a single individual. Among the key shortcomings of such \nsystems are the limited reliability, the lack of specificity and the limited generalisability. \nTherefore, AI systems identifying or inferring emotions or intentions of natural persons \non the basis of their biometric data may lead to discriminatory outcomes and can be \nintrusive to the rights and freedoms of the concerned persons. Considering the \nimbalance of power in the context of work or education, combined with the intrusive \nnature of these systems, such systems could lead to detrimental or unfavourable \ntreatment of certain natural persons or whole groups thereof. Therefore, the placing on \nthe market, the putting into service, or the use of AI systems intended to be used to detect \nthe emotional state of individuals in situations related to the workplace and education \nshould be prohibited. That prohibition should not cover AI systems placed on the market \nstrictly for medical or safety reasons, such as systems intended for therapeutical use.\n(45) Practices that are prohibited by Union law, including data protection law, non-\ndiscrimination law, consumer protection law, and competition law, should not be \naffected by this Regulation.\n(46) High-risk AI systems should only be placed on the Union market, put into service or used \nif they comply with certain mandatory requirements. Those requirements should ensure \nthat high-risk AI systems available in the Union or whose output is otherwise used in the \nUnion do not pose unacceptable risks to important Union public interests as recognised and \nprotected by Union law. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in the \nCommission notice \u201cThe \u2018Blue Guide\u2019 on the implementation of EU product rules \n2022\u201d21, the general rule is that Union harmonisation legislation, such as Regulations \n(EU) 2017/74522 and (EU) 2017/74623 of the European Parliament and of the Council \nand Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council24, may be \napplicable to one product, since the making available or putting into service can take \nplace only when the product complies with all applicable Union harmonisation \nlegislation. To ensure consistency and avoid an unnecessary administrative burden or \nunnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI system, \nto which the requirements of this Regulation or of the Union harmonisation legislation \nlisted in an annex to this Regulation apply, should be flexible with regard to operational \ndecisions on how to ensure compliance of a product that contains one or more AI \nsystems with all applicable requirements of the Union harmonisation legislation in an \noptimal manner. AI systems identified as high-risk should be limited to those that have a \nsignificant harmful impact on the health, safety and fundamental rights of persons in the \nUnion and such limitation minimises any potential restriction to international trade.\n21 OJ C 247, 29.6.2022, p. 1.\n22Regulation (EU) 2017/745 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 \non medical devices, amending Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and \nRegulation (EC) No 1223/2009 and repealing Council Directives 90/385/EEC and \n93/42/EEC (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 1).\n23Regulation (EU) 2017/746 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2017 \non in vitro diagnostic medical devices and repealing Directive 98/79/EC and Commission \nDecision 2010/227/EU (OJ L 117, 5.5.2017, p. 176).\n24Directive 2006/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on \nmachinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p. 24).\n(47) AI systems could have an adverse impact to health and safety of persons, in particular \nwhen such systems operate as safety components. Consistently with the objectives of \nUnion harmonisation legislation to facilitate the free movement of products in the internal \nmarket and to ensure that only safe and otherwise compliant products find their way into \nthe market, it is important that the safety risks that may be generated by a product as a \nwhole due to its digital components, including AI systems, are duly prevented and \nmitigated. For instance, increasingly autonomous robots, whether in the context of \nmanufacturing or personal assistance and care should be able to safely operate and \nperforms their functions in complex environments. Similarly, in the health sector where the \nstakes for life and health are particularly high, increasingly sophisticated diagnostics \nsystems and systems supporting human decisions should be reliable and accurate. \u258c\n(48) The extent of the adverse impact caused by the AI system on the fundamental rights \nprotected by the Charter is of particular relevance when classifying an AI system as high \nrisk. Those rights include the right to human dignity, respect for private and family life, \nprotection of personal data, freedom of expression and information, freedom of \nassembly and of association, and non-discrimination, right to education consumer \nprotection, workers\u2019 rights, rights of persons with disabilities, gender equality, \nintellectual property rights, right to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, right of \ndefence and the presumption of innocence, right to good administration. In addition to \nthose rights, it is important to highlight the fact that children have specific rights as \nenshrined in Article 24 of the Charter and in the United Nations Convention on the \nRights of the Child, further developed in the UNCRC General Comment No 25 as \nregards the digital environment, both of which require consideration of the children\u2019s \nvulnerabilities and provision of such protection and care as necessary for their well-\nbeing. The fundamental right to a high level of environmental protection enshrined in \nthe Charter and implemented in Union policies should also be considered when \nassessing the severity of the harm that an AI system can cause, including in relation to \nthe health and safety of persons.\n(49) As regards high-risk AI systems that are safety components of products or systems, or \nwhich are themselves products or systems falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No \n300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council25, Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 \nof the European Parliament and of the Council26, Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council27, Directive 2014/90/EU of the European \nParliament and of the Council28, Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council29, Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil30, \n25Regulation (EC) No 300/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March \n2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation security and repealing Regulation (EC) \nNo 2320/2002 (OJ L 97, 9.4.2008, p. 72).\n26Regulation (EU) No 167/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 February \n2013 on the approval and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry vehicles (OJ L 60, \n2.3.2013, p. 1).\n27Regulation (EU) No 168/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 January \n2013 on the approval and market surveillance of two- or three-wheel vehicles and \nquadricycles (OJ L 60, 2.3.2013, p. 52).\n28Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on \nmarine equipment and repealing Council Directive 96/98/EC (OJ L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 146).\n29Directive (EU) 2016/797 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2016 on \nthe interoperability of the rail system within the European Union (OJ L 138, 26.5.2016, p. \n44).\n30Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2018 \non the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, \ncomponents and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, amending Regulations \n(EC) No 715/2007 and (EC) No 595/2009 and repealing Directive 2007/46/EC (OJ L 151, \n14.6.2018, p. 1).\nRegulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council31, and \nRegulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council32, it is \nappropriate to amend those acts to ensure that the Commission takes into account, on the \nbasis of the technical and regulatory specificities of each sector, and without interfering \nwith existing governance, conformity assessment and enforcement mechanisms and \nauthorities established therein, the mandatory requirements for high-risk AI systems laid \ndown in this Regulation when adopting any relevant delegated or implementing acts on the \nbasis of those acts.\n31Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 \non common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation \nSafety Agency, and amending Regulations (EC) No 2111/2005, (EC) No 1008/2008, (EU) \nNo 996/2010, (EU) No 376/2014 and Directives 2014/30/EU and 2014/53/EU of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council, and repealing Regulations (EC) No 552/2004 and \n(EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Council Regulation \n(EEC) No 3922/91 (OJ L 212, 22.8.2018, p. 1).\n32Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November \n2019 on type-approval requirements for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, \ncomponents and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, as regards their general \nsafety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users, amending \nRegulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing \nRegulations (EC) No 78/2009, (EC) No 79/2009 and (EC) No 661/2009 of the European \nParliament and of the Council and Commission Regulations (EC) No 631/2009, (EU) No \n406/2010, (EU) No 672/2010, (EU) No 1003/2010, (EU) No 1005/2010, (EU) No \n1008/2010, (EU) No 1009/2010, (EU) No 19/2011, (EU) No 109/2011, (EU) No 458/2011, \n(EU) No 65/2012, (EU) No 130/2012, (EU) No 347/2012, (EU) No 351/2012, (EU) No \n1230/2012 and (EU) 2015/166 (OJ L 325, 16.12.2019, p. 1).\n(50) As regards AI systems that are safety components of products, or which are themselves \nproducts, falling within the scope of certain Union harmonisation legislation, it is \nappropriate to classify them as high-risk under this Regulation if the product concerned \nundergoes the conformity assessment procedure with a third-party conformity assessment \nbody pursuant to that relevant Union harmonisation legislation. In particular, such products \nare machinery, toys, lifts, equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially \nexplosive atmospheres, radio equipment, pressure equipment, recreational craft equipment, \ncableway installations, appliances burning gaseous fuels, medical devices, and in vitro \ndiagnostic medical devices.\n(51) The classification of an AI system as high-risk pursuant to this Regulation should not \nnecessarily mean that the product whose safety component is the AI system, or the AI \nsystem itself as a product, is considered to be high-risk under the criteria established in the \nrelevant Union harmonisation legislation that applies to the product. This is, in particular, \nthe case for Regulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746, where a third-party \nconformity assessment is provided for medium-risk and high-risk products.\n(52) As regards stand-alone AI systems, namely high-risk AI systems other than those that are \nsafety components, or which are themselves products, it is appropriate to classify them as \nhigh-risk if, in the light of their intended purpose, they pose a high risk of harm to the \nhealth and safety or the fundamental rights of persons, taking into account both the severity \nof the possible harm and its probability of occurrence and they are used in a number of \nspecifically pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation. The identification of those \nsystems is based on the same methodology and criteria envisaged also for any future \namendments of the list of high-risk AI systems that the Commission should be \nempowered to adopt, via delegated acts, to take into account the rapid pace of \ntechnological development, as well as the potential changes in the use of AI systems.\n(53) It is also important to clarify that there may be specific cases in which AI systems \nreferred to pre-defined areas specified in this Regulation do not lead to a significant risk \nof harm to the legal interests protected under those areas because they do not materially \ninfluence the decision-making or do not harm those interests substantially. For the \npurposes of this Regulation an AI system that does not materially influence the outcome \nof decision-making should be understood to be an AI system that does not have an \nimpact on the substance, and thereby the outcome, of decision-making, whether human \nor automated. An AI system that does not materially influence the outcome of decision-\nmaking could include situations in which one or more of the following conditions are \nfulfilled. The first such condition should be that the AI system is intended to perform a \nnarrow procedural task, such as an AI system that transforms unstructured data into \nstructured data, an AI system that classifies incoming documents into categories or an \nAI system that is used to detect duplicates among a large number of applications. Those \ntasks are of such narrow and limited nature that they pose only limited risks which are \nnot increased through the use in a context that is listed as a high-risk use in an annex to \nthis Regulation. The second condition should be that the task performed by the AI \nsystem is intended to improve the result of a previously completed human activity that \nmay be relevant for the purposes of that list. Considering those characteristics, the AI \nsystem provides only an additional layer to a human activity with consequently lowered \nrisk. That condition would, for example, apply to AI systems that are intended to improve \nthe language used in previously drafted documents, for instance in relation to \nprofessional tone, academic style of language or by aligning text to a certain brand \nmessaging. \nThe third condition should be that the AI system is intended to detect decision-making \npatterns or deviations from prior decision-making patterns. The risk would be lowered \nbecause the use of the AI system follows a previously completed human assessment \nwhich it is not meant to replace or influence, without proper human review. Such AI \nsystems include for instance those that, given a certain grading pattern of a teacher, can \nbe used to check ex post whether the teacher may have deviated from the grading pattern \nso as to flag potential inconsistencies or anomalies. The fourth condition should be that \nthe AI system is intended to perform a task that is only preparatory to an assessment \nrelevant for the purposes of the AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, thus \nmaking the possible impact of the output of the system very low in terms of representing \na risk for the assessment to follow. That condition covers, inter alia, smart solutions for \nfile handling, which include various functions from indexing, searching, text and speech \nprocessing or linking data to other data sources, or AI systems used for translation of \ninitial documents. In any case, those high-risk AI systems should be considered to pose \nsignificant risks of harm to the health, safety or fundamental rights of natural persons if \nthe AI system implies profiling within the meaning of Article 4, point (4) of Regulation \n(EU) 2016/679 or Article 3, point (4) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 or Article 3, point (5) of \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725. To ensure traceability and transparency, a provider who \nconsiders that an AI systems is not high-risk on the basis of those conditions should \ndraw up documentation of the assessment before that system is placed on the market or \nput into service and should provide this documentation to national competent authorities \nupon request. Such a provider should be obliged to register the system in the EU \ndatabase established under this Regulation. With a view to provide further guidance for \nthe practical implementation of the conditions under which the high-risk AI systems \nlisted in the annex are, on an exceptional basis, non-high-risk, the Commission should, \nafter consulting the Board, provide guidelines specifying that practical implementation \ncompleted by a comprehensive list of practical examples of use cases of AI systems that \nare high-risk and not high-risk.\n\u258c\n(54) As biometric data constitutes a special category of sensitive personal data, it is \nappropriate to classify as high-risk several critical-use cases of biometric systems, \ninsofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law. Technical \ninaccuracies of AI systems intended for the remote biometric identification of natural \npersons can lead to biased results and entail discriminatory effects. The risk of such \nbiased results and discriminatory effects are particularly relevant with regard to age, \nethnicity, race, sex or disabilities. Remote biometric identification systems should \ntherefore be classified as high-risk in view of the risks that they pose. Such classification \nexcludes AI systems intended to be used for biometric verification, including \nauthentication, the sole purpose of which is to confirm that a specific natural person \nwho he or she claims to be and to confirm the identity of a natural person for the sole \npurpose of having access to a service, unlocking a device or having secure access to \npremises. In addition, AI systems intended to be used for biometric categorisation \naccording to sensitive attributes or characteristics protected under Article 9(1) of \nRegulation (EU) 2016/679 on the basis of biometric data, in so far as these are not \nprohibited under this Regulation, and emotion recognition systems that are not \nprohibited under this Regulation, should be classified as high-risk. Biometric systems \nwhich are intended to be used solely for the purpose of enabling cybersecurity and \npersonal data protection measures should not be considered to be high-risk systems.\n(55) As regards the management and operation of critical infrastructure, it is appropriate to \nclassify as high-risk the AI systems intended to be used as safety components in the \nmanagement and operation of critical digital infrastructure as listed in Annex I, point \n(8),to Directive (EU) 2022/2557, road traffic and the supply of water, gas, heating and \nelectricity, since their failure or malfunctioning may put at risk the life and health of \npersons at large scale and lead to appreciable disruptions in the ordinary conduct of social \nand economic activities. Safety components of critical infrastructure, including critical \ndigital infrastructure, are systems used to directly protect the physical integrity of critical \ninfrastructure or health and safety of persons and property but which are not necessary \nin order for the system to function. The failure or malfunctioning of such components \nmight directly lead to risks to the physical integrity of critical infrastructure and thus to \nrisks to health and safety of persons and property. Components intended to be used \nsolely for cybersecurity purposes should not qualify as safety components. Examples of \nsafety components of such critical infrastructure may include systems for monitoring \nwater pressure or fire alarm controlling systems in cloud computing centres.\n(56)The deployment of AI systems in education is important to promote high-quality digital \neducation and training and to allow all learners and teachers to acquire and share the \nnecessary digital skills and competences, including media literacy, and critical thinking, \nto take an active part in the economy, society, and in democratic processes. However, AI \nsystems used in education or vocational training, in particular for determining access or \nadmission, for assigning persons to educational and vocational training institutions or \nprogrammes at all levels, for evaluating learning outcomes of persons, for assessing the \nappropriate level of education for an individual and materially influencing the level of \neducation and training that individuals will receive or will be able to access or for \nmonitoring and detecting prohibited behaviour of students during tests should be \nclassified as high-risk AI systems, since they may determine the educational and \nprofessional course of a person\u2019s life and therefore affect that person\u2019s ability to secure a \nlivelihood. When improperly designed and used, such systems may be particularly \nintrusive and may violate the right to education and training as well as the right not to be \ndiscriminated against and perpetuate historical patterns of discrimination, for example \nagainst women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, or persons of certain racial \nor ethnic origins or sexual orientation.\n(57) AI systems used in employment, workers management and access to self-employment, in \nparticular for the recruitment and selection of persons, for making decisions affecting \nterms of the work related relationship promotion and termination of work-related \ncontractual relationships for allocating tasks on the basis of individual behaviour, \npersonal traits or characteristics and for monitoring or evaluation of persons in work-\nrelated contractual relationships, should also be classified as high-risk, since those systems \nmay have an appreciable impact on future career prospects, livelihoods of those persons \nand workers\u2019 rights. Relevant work-related contractual relationships should, in a \nmeaningful manner, involve employees and persons providing services through platforms \nas referred to in the Commission Work Programme 2021. \u258c Throughout the recruitment \nprocess and in the evaluation, promotion, or retention of persons in work-related \ncontractual relationships, such systems may perpetuate historical patterns of \ndiscrimination, for example against women, certain age groups, persons with disabilities, \nor persons of certain racial or ethnic origins or sexual orientation. AI systems used to \nmonitor the performance and behaviour of such persons may also undermine their \nfundamental rights to data protection and privacy.\n(58) Another area in which the use of AI systems deserves special consideration is the access to \nand enjoyment of certain essential private and public services and benefits necessary for \npeople to fully participate in society or to improve one\u2019s standard of living. In particular, \u258c \nnatural persons applying for or receiving essential public assistance benefits and services \nfrom public authorities namely healthcare services, social security benefits, social \nservices providing protection in cases such as maternity, illness, industrial accidents, \ndependency or old age and loss of employment and social and housing assistance, are \ntypically dependent on those benefits and services and in a vulnerable position in relation \nto the responsible authorities. If AI systems are used for determining whether such benefits \nand services should be granted, denied, reduced, revoked or reclaimed by authorities, \nincluding whether beneficiaries are legitimately entitled to such benefits or services, \nthose systems may have a significant impact on persons\u2019 livelihood and may infringe their \nfundamental rights, such as the right to social protection, non-discrimination, human \ndignity or an effective remedy and should therefore be classified as high-risk. Nonetheless, \nthis Regulation should not hamper the development and use of innovative approaches in \nthe public administration, which would stand to benefit from a wider use of compliant and \nsafe AI systems, provided that those systems do not entail a high risk to legal and natural \npersons. \nIn addition, AI systems used to evaluate the credit score or creditworthiness of natural \npersons should be classified as high-risk AI systems, since they determine those persons\u2019 \naccess to financial resources or essential services such as housing, electricity, and \ntelecommunication services. AI systems used for those purposes may lead to \ndiscrimination between persons or groups and may perpetuate historical patterns of \ndiscrimination, such as that based on racial or ethnic origins, gender, disabilities, age or \nsexual orientation, or may create new forms of discriminatory impacts. However, AI \nsystems provided for by Union law for the purpose of detecting fraud in the offering of \nfinancial services and for prudential purposes to calculate credit institutions\u2019 and \ninsurances undertakings\u2019 capital requirements should not be considered to be high-risk \nunder this Regulation. Moreover, AI systems intended to be used for risk assessment and \npricing in relation to natural persons for health and life insurance can also have a \nsignificant impact on persons\u2019 livelihood and if not duly designed, developed and used, \ncan infringe their fundamental rights and can lead to serious consequences for people\u2019s \nlife and health, including financial exclusion and discrimination. Finally, AI systems \nused to evaluate and classify emergency calls by natural persons or to dispatch or \nestablish priority in the dispatching of emergency first response services, including by \npolice, firefighters and medical aid, as well as of emergency healthcare patient triage \nsystems, should also be classified as high-risk since they make decisions in very critical \nsituations for the life and health of persons and their property.\n(59)Given their role and responsibility, actions by law enforcement authorities involving \ncertain uses of AI systems are characterised by a significant degree of power imbalance \nand may lead to surveillance, arrest or deprivation of a natural person\u2019s liberty as well as \nother adverse impacts on fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter. In particular, if the \nAI system is not trained with high-quality data, does not meet adequate requirements in \nterms of its performance, its accuracy or robustness, or is not properly designed and tested \nbefore being put on the market or otherwise put into service, it may single out people in a \ndiscriminatory or otherwise incorrect or unjust manner. Furthermore, the exercise of \nimportant procedural fundamental rights, such as the right to an effective remedy and to a \nfair trial as well as the right of defence and the presumption of innocence, could be \nhampered, in particular, where such AI systems are not sufficiently transparent, \nexplainable and documented. It is therefore appropriate to classify as high-risk, insofar as \ntheir use is permitted under relevant Union and national law, a number of AI systems \nintended to be used in the law enforcement context where accuracy, reliability and \ntransparency is particularly important to avoid adverse impacts, retain public trust and \nensure accountability and effective redress. \nIn view of the nature of the activities and the risks relating thereto, those high-risk AI \nsystems should include in particular AI systems intended to be used by or on behalf of law \nenforcement authorities or by Union bodies, offices, or agencies in support of law \nenforcement authorities for assessing the risk of a natural person to become a victim of \ncriminal offences, as polygraphs and similar tools, for the evaluation of the reliability of \nevidence in in the course of investigation or prosecution of criminal offences, and, \ninsofar not prohibited under this Regulation, for assessing the risk of a natural person \noffending or reoffending not solely on the basis of the profiling of natural persons or the \nassessment of personality traits and characteristics or the past criminal behaviour of natural \npersons or groups, for profiling in the course of detection, investigation or prosecution of \ncriminal offences \u258c . AI systems specifically intended to be used for administrative \nproceedings by tax and customs authorities as well as by financial intelligence units \ncarrying out administrative tasks analysing information pursuant to Union anti-money \nlaundering law should not be classified as high-risk AI systems used by law enforcement \nauthorities for the purpose of prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of \ncriminal offences. The use of AI tools by law enforcement and authorities should not \nbecome a factor of inequality, or exclusion. The impact of the use of AI tools on the \ndefence rights of suspects should not be ignored, in particular the difficulty in obtaining \nmeaningful information on the functioning of those systems and the resulting difficulty \nin challenging their results in court, in particular by natural persons under \ninvestigation.\n(60) AI systems used in migration, asylum and border control management affect people who \nare often in particularly vulnerable position and who are dependent on the outcome of the \nactions of the competent public authorities. The accuracy, non-discriminatory nature and \ntransparency of the AI systems used in those contexts are therefore particularly important \nto guarantee respect for the fundamental rights of the affected persons, in particular their \nrights to free movement, non-discrimination, protection of private life and personal data, \ninternational protection and good administration. It is therefore appropriate to classify as \nhigh-risk, insofar as their use is permitted under relevant Union and national law AI \nsystems intended to be used by or on behalf of competent public authorities or by Union \ninstitutions, bodies, offices or agencies charged with tasks in the fields of migration, \nasylum and border control management as polygraphs and similar tools, for assessing \ncertain risks posed by natural persons entering the territory of a Member State or applying \nfor visa or asylum, for assisting competent public authorities for the examination, \nincluding related assessment of the reliability of evidence, of applications for asylum, visa \nand residence permits and associated complaints with regard to the objective to establish \nthe eligibility of the natural persons applying for a status, for the purpose of detecting, \nrecognising or identifying natural persons in the context of migration, asylum and \nborder control management with the exception of verification of travel documents. \nAI systems in the area of migration, asylum and border control management covered by \nthis Regulation should comply with the relevant procedural requirements set by the \nRegulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council33, the \nDirective 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council34, and other relevant \nUnion law. The use of AI systems in migration, asylum and border control management \nshould, in no circumstances, be used by Member States or Union institutions, bodies, \noffices or agencies as a means to circumvent their international obligations under the \nUN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees done at Geneva on 28 July 1951 as \namended by the Protocol of 31 January 1967. Nor should they be used to in any way \ninfringe on the principle of non-refoulement, or to deny safe and effective legal avenues \ninto the territory of the Union, including the right to international protection.\n33\u258c Regulation (EC) No 810/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July \n2009 establishing a Community Code on Visas (Visa Code) (OJ L 243, 15.9.2009, p. 1).\n34\u258c Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on \ncommon procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection (OJ L 180, \n29.6.2013, p. 60).\n(61) Certain AI systems intended for the administration of justice and democratic processes \nshould be classified as high-risk, considering their potentially significant impact on \ndemocracy, the rule of law, individual freedoms as well as the right to an effective remedy \nand to a fair trial. In particular, to address the risks of potential biases, errors and opacity, it \nis appropriate to qualify as high-risk AI systems intended to be used by a judicial \nauthority or on its behalf to assist judicial authorities in researching and interpreting facts \nand the law and in applying the law to a concrete set of facts. AI systems intended to be \nused by alternative dispute resolution bodies for those purposes should also be \nconsidered to be high-risk when the outcomes of the alternative dispute resolution \nproceedings produce legal effects for the parties. The use of AI tools can support the \ndecision-making power of judges or judicial independence, but should not replace it: the \nfinal decision-making must remain a human-driven activity. The classification of AI \nsystems as high-risk should not, however, extend to AI systems intended for purely \nancillary administrative activities that do not affect the actual administration of justice in \nindividual cases, such as anonymisation or pseudonymisation of judicial decisions, \ndocuments or data, communication between personnel, administrative tasks \u258c.\n(62) Without prejudice to the rules provided for in Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026 of the European \nParliament and of the Council35+, and in order to address the risks of undue external \ninterference to the right to vote enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter, and of adverse \neffects on democracy and the rule of law, AI systems intended to be used to influence the \noutcome of an election or referendum or the voting behaviour of natural persons in the \nexercise of their vote in elections or referenda should be classified as high-risk AI \nsystems with the exception of AI systems whose output natural persons are not directly \nexposed to, such as tools used to organise, optimise and structure political campaigns \nfrom an administrative and logistical point of view.\n(63) The fact that an AI system is classified as a high-risk AI system under this Regulation \nshould not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system is \u258c lawful under other \nacts of Union law or under national law compatible with Union law, such as on the \nprotection of personal data, on the use of polygraphs and similar tools or other systems to \ndetect the emotional state of natural persons. Any such use should continue to occur solely \nin accordance with the applicable requirements resulting from the Charter and from the \napplicable acts of secondary Union law and national law. This Regulation should not be \nunderstood as providing for the legal ground for processing of personal data, including \nspecial categories of personal data, where relevant, unless it is specifically otherwise \nprovided for in this Regulation.\n35Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026 of the European parliament and of the Council of ... on the \ntransparency and targeting of political advertising (OJ L, \u2026, ELI: \u2026).\n+OJ: please, insert in the text the number of the Regulation in PE 90/23 (2021/0381(COD)) \nand complete the corresponding footnote.\n(64) To mitigate the risks from high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service \nand to ensure a high level of trustworthiness, certain mandatory requirements should \napply to high-risk AI systems, taking into account the intended purpose and the context of \nuse of the AI system and according to the risk-management system to be established by the \nprovider. The measures adopted by the providers to comply with the mandatory \nrequirements of this Regulation should take into account the generally acknowledge \nstate of the art on AI, be proportionate and effective to meet the objectives of this \nRegulation. Based on the New Legislative Framework, as clarified in Commission notice \n\u201cThe \u2018Blue Guide\u2019 on the implementation of EU product rules 2022\u201d, the general rule is \nthat Union harmonisation legislation may be applicable to one product, since the \nmaking available or putting into service can take place only when the product complies \nwith all applicable Union harmonisation legislation. The hazards of AI systems covered \nby the requirements of this Regulation concern different aspects than the existing Union \nharmonisation acts and therefore the requirements of this Regulation would complement \nthe existing body of the Union harmonisation acts. For example, machinery or medical \ndevices products incorporating an AI system might present risks not addressed by the \nessential health and safety requirements set out in the relevant Union harmonised \nlegislation, as that sectoral law does not deal with risks specific to AI systems. \nThis calls for a simultaneous and complementary application of the various legislative \nacts. To ensure consistency and to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden and \nunnecessary costs, providers of a product that contains one or more high-risk AI system, \nto which the requirements of this Regulation and of the Union harmonisation legislation \nbased on the New Legislative Framework listed in an annex to this Regulation apply, \nshould be flexible with regard to operational decisions on how to ensure compliance of a \nproduct that contains one or more AI systems with all the applicable requirements of \nthat Union harmonised legislation in an optimal manner. That flexibility could mean, \nfor example a decision by the provider to integrate a part of the necessary testing and \nreporting processes, information and documentation required under this Regulation into \nalready existing documentation and procedures required under existing Union \nharmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework listed in an annex to \nthis Regulation. This should not, in any way, undermine the obligation of the provider to \ncomply with all the applicable requirements.\n(65) The risk-management system should consist of a continuous, iterative process that is \nplanned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system. This process \nshould be aimed at identifying and mitigating the relevant risks of AI systems on health, \nsafety and fundamental rights. The risk-management system should be regularly \nreviewed and updated to ensure its continuing effectiveness, as well as justification and \ndocumentation of any significant decisions and actions taken subject to this Regulation. \nThis process should ensure that the provider identifies risks or adverse impacts and \nimplements mitigation measures for the known and reasonably foreseeable risks of AI \nsystems to the health, safety and fundamental rights in light of its intended purpose and \nreasonably foreseeable misuse, including the possible risks arising from the interaction \nbetween the AI system and the environment within which it operates. The risk-\nmanagement system should adopt the most appropriate risk-management measures in \nthe light of the state of the art in AI. When identifying the most appropriate risk-\nmanagement measures, the provider should document and explain the choices made \nand, when relevant, involve experts and external stakeholders. In identifying the \nreasonably foreseeable misuse of high-risk AI systems, the provider should cover uses of \nAI systems which, while not directly covered by the intended purpose and provided for in \nthe instruction for use may nevertheless be reasonably expected to result from readily \npredictable human behaviour in the context of the specific characteristics and use of a \nparticular AI system. \nAny known or foreseeable circumstances related to the use of the high-risk AI system in \naccordance with its intended purpose or under conditions of reasonably foreseeable \nmisuse, which may lead to risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights should be \nincluded in the instructions for use provided by the provider. This is to ensure that the \ndeployer is aware and takes them into account when using the high-risk AI system. \nIdentifying and implementing risk mitigation measures for foreseeable misuse under this \nRegulation should not require specific additional training measures for the high-risk AI \nsystem by the provider to address them. The providers however are encouraged to \nconsider such additional training measures to mitigate reasonable foreseeable misuses \nas necessary and appropriate.\n(66) Requirements should apply to high-risk AI systems as regards risk management, the \nquality and relevance of data sets used, technical documentation and record-keeping, \ntransparency and the provision of information to deployers, human oversight, and \nrobustness, accuracy and cybersecurity. Those requirements are necessary to effectively \nmitigate the risks for health, safety and fundamental rights, \u258c and no other less trade \nrestrictive measures are reasonably available, thus avoiding unjustified restrictions to trade.\n(67)High-quality data and access to high-quality data plays a vital role in providing structure \nand in ensuring the performance of many AI systems, especially when techniques \ninvolving the training of models are used, with a view to ensure that the high-risk AI \nsystem performs as intended and safely and it does not become a source of discrimination \nprohibited by Union law. High-quality data sets for training, validation and testing \nrequire the implementation of appropriate data governance and management practices. \nData sets for training, validation and testing, including the labels, should be relevant, \nsufficiently representative, and to the best extent possible free of errors and complete in \nview of the intended purpose of the system. In order to facilitate compliance with Union \ndata protection law, such as Regulation (EU) 2016/679, data governance and \nmanagement practices should include, in the case of personal data, transparency about \nthe original purpose of the data collection. The data sets should also have the appropriate \nstatistical properties, including as regards the persons or groups of persons in relation to \nwhom the high-risk AI system is intended to be used, with specific attention to the \nmitigation of possible biases in the data sets, that are likely to affect the health and safety \nof persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination \nprohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for future \noperations (feedback loops). Biases can for example be inherent in underlying data sets, \nespecially when historical data is being used, or generated when the systems are \nimplemented in real world settings. \nResults provided by AI systems could be influenced by such inherent biases that are \ninclined to gradually increase and thereby perpetuate and amplify existing \ndiscrimination, in particular for vulnerable persons belonging to certain groups, \nincluding racial or ethnic groups. The requirement for the data sets to be to the best \nextent possible complete and free of errors should not affect the use of privacy-\npreserving techniques in the context of the development and testing of AI systems. In \nparticular, data sets should take into account, to the extent required by their intended \npurpose, the features, characteristics or elements that are particular to the specific \ngeographical, contextual, behavioural or functional setting which the AI system is \nintended to be used. The requirements related to data governance can be complied with \nby having recourse to third-parties that offer certified compliance services including \nverification of data governance, data set integrity, and data training, validation and \ntesting practices, as far as compliance with the data requirements of this Regulation are \nensured.\n(68) For the development and assessment of high-risk AI systems, certain actors, such as \nproviders, notified bodies and other relevant entities, such as European Digital Innovation \nHubs, testing experimentation facilities and researchers, should be able to access and use \nhigh-quality data sets within the fields of activities of those actors which are related to this \nRegulation. European common data spaces established by the Commission and the \nfacilitation of data sharing between businesses and with government in the public interest \nwill be instrumental to provide trustful, accountable and non-discriminatory access to high-\nquality data for the training, validation and testing of AI systems. For example, in health, \nthe European health data space will facilitate non-discriminatory access to health data and \nthe training of AI algorithms on those data sets, in a privacy-preserving, secure, timely, \ntransparent and trustworthy manner, and with an appropriate institutional governance. \nRelevant competent authorities, including sectoral ones, providing or supporting the access \nto data may also support the provision of high-quality data for the training, validation and \ntesting of AI systems.\n(69) The right to privacy and to protection of personal data must be guaranteed throughout \nthe entire lifecycle of the AI system. In this regard, the principles of data minimisation \nand data protection by design and by default, as set out in Union data protection law, are \napplicable when personal data are processed. Measures taken by providers to ensure \ncompliance with those principles may include not only anonymisation and encryption, \nbut also the use of technology that permits algorithms to be brought to the data and \nallows training of AI systems without the transmission between parties or copying of the \nraw or structured data themselves, without prejudice to the requirements on data \ngovernance provided for in this Regulation.\n(70) In order to protect the right of others from the discrimination that might result from the \nbias in AI systems, the providers should, exceptionally, to the extent that it is strictly \nnecessary for the purpose of ensuring bias detection and correction in relation to the \nhigh-risk AI systems, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and \nfreedoms of natural persons and following the application of all applicable conditions \nlaid down under this Regulation in addition to the conditions laid down in Regulations \n(EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, be able to process also \nspecial categories of personal data, as a matter of substantial public interest within the \nmeaning of Article 9(2), point (g) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 10(2), point \n(g) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.\n(71) Having comprehensible information on how high-risk AI systems have been developed \nand how they perform throughout their lifetime is essential to enable traceability of those \nsystems, verify compliance with the requirements under this Regulation, as well as \nmonitoring of their operations and post market monitoring. This requires keeping records \nand the availability of a technical documentation, containing information which is \nnecessary to assess the compliance of the AI system with the relevant requirements and \nfacilitate post market monitoring. Such information should include the general \ncharacteristics, capabilities and limitations of the system, algorithms, data, training, testing \nand validation processes used as well as documentation on the relevant risk-management \nsystem and drawn in a clear and comprehensive form. The technical documentation \nshould be kept up to date, appropriately throughout the lifetime of the AI system. \nFurthermore, high-risk AI systems should technically allow for the automatic recording \nof events, by means of logs, over the duration of the lifetime of the system.\n(72) To address concerns related to opacity and complexity of certain AI systems and help \ndeployers to fulfil their obligations under this Regulation, transparency should be \nrequired for high-risk AI systems before they are placed on the market or put it into \nservice. High-risk AI systems should be designed in a manner to enable deployers to \nunderstand how the AI system works, evaluate its functionality, and comprehend its \nstrengths and limitations. High-risk AI systems, should \u258c be accompanied by appropriate \ninformation in the form of instructions of use. Such information should include the \ncharacteristics, capabilities and limitations of performance of the AI system. Such \nelements would cover information on possible known or foreseeable circumstances \nrelated to the use of the high-risk AI system, including deployer action that may \ninfluence system behaviour and performance, under which the AI system can lead to \nrisks to health, safety, and fundamental rights, on the changes that have been pre-\ndetermined and assessed for conformity by the provider and on the relevant human \noversight measures, including the measures to facilitate the interpretation of the outputs \nof the AI system by the deployers. Transparency, including the accompanying \ninstructions for use, should assist deployers in the use of the system and support \ninformed decision making by them. Among others, deployers should be in a better \nposition to make the correct choice of the system they intend to use in the light of the \nobligations applicable to them, be educated about the intended and precluded uses, and \nuse the AI system correctly and as appropriate. In order to enhance legibility and \naccessibility of the information included in the instructions of use, where appropriate, \nillustrative examples, for instance on the limitations and on the intended and precluded \nuses of the AI system, should be included. Providers should ensure that all \ndocumentation, including the instructions for use, contains meaningful, comprehensive, \naccessible and understandable information, taking into account the needs and \nforeseeable knowledge of the target deployers. Instructions for use should be made \navailable in a language which can be easily understood by target deployers, as \ndetermined by the Member State concerned.\n(73) High-risk AI systems should be designed and developed in such a way that natural persons \ncan oversee their functioning, ensure that they are used as intended and that their \nimpacts are addressed over the system\u2019s lifecycle. For this purpose, appropriate human \noversight measures should be identified by the provider of the system before its placing on \nthe market or putting into service. In particular, where appropriate, such measures should \nguarantee that the system is subject to in-built operational constraints that cannot be \noverridden by the system itself and is responsive to the human operator, and that the \nnatural persons to whom human oversight has been assigned have the necessary \ncompetence, training and authority to carry out that role. It is also essential, as \nappropriate, to ensure that high-risk AI systems include mechanisms to guide and \ninform a natural person to whom human oversight has been assigned to make informed \ndecisions if, when and how to intervene in order to avoid negative consequences or risks, \nor stop the system if it does not perform as intended. Considering the significant \nconsequences for persons in the case of an incorrect match by certain biometric \nidentification systems, it is appropriate to provide for an enhanced human oversight \nrequirement for those systems so that no action or decision may be taken by the deployer \non the basis of the identification resulting from the system unless this has been \nseparately verified and confirmed by at least two natural persons. Those persons could \nbe from one or more entities and include the person operating or using the system. This \nrequirement should not pose unnecessary burden or delays and it could be sufficient that \nthe separate verifications by the different persons are automatically recorded in the logs \ngenerated by the system. Given the specificities of the areas of law enforcement, \nmigration, border control and asylum, this requirement should not apply where Union \nor national law considers the application of that requirement to be disproportionate.\n(74) High-risk AI systems should perform consistently throughout their lifecycle and meet an \nappropriate level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity, in the light of their intended \npurpose and in accordance with the generally acknowledged state of the art. The \nCommission and relevant organisations and stakeholders are encouraged to take due \nconsideration of the mitigation of risks and the negative impacts of the AI system. The \nexpected level of performance metrics should be declared in the accompanying \ninstructions of use. Providers are urged to communicate that information to deployers in \na clear and easily understandable way, free of misunderstandings or misleading \nstatements. Union law on legal metrology, including Directives 2014/31/EU36 and \n2014/32/EU37 of the European Parliament and of the Council, aims to ensure the \naccuracy of measurements and to help the transparency and fairness of commercial \ntransactions. In that context, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders and \norganisation, such as metrology and benchmarking authorities, the Commission should \nencourage, as appropriate, the development of benchmarks and measurement \nmethodologies for AI systems. In doing so, the Commission should take note and \ncollaborate with international partners working on metrology and relevant measurement \nindicators relating to AI.\n36Directive 2014/31/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 \non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on \nthe market of non-automatic weighing instruments (OJ L 96, 29.3.2014, p. 107).\n37Directive 2014/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 \non the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making available on \nthe market of measuring instruments (OJ L 096 29.3.2014, p. 149).\n(75) The technical robustness is a key requirement for high-risk AI systems. They should be \nresilient in relation to harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour that may result from \nlimitations within the systems or the environment in which the systems operate (e.g. \nerrors, faults, inconsistencies, unexpected situations). Therefore, technical and \norganisational measures should be taken to ensure robustness of high-risk AI systems, \nfor example by designing and developing appropriate technical solutions to prevent or \nminimize harmful or otherwise undesirable behaviour. Those technical solution may \ninclude for instance mechanisms enabling the system to safely interrupt its operation \n(fail-safe plans) in the presence of certain anomalies or when operation takes place \noutside certain predetermined boundaries. Failure to protect against these risks could lead \nto safety impacts or negatively affect the fundamental rights, for example due to erroneous \ndecisions or wrong or biased outputs generated by the AI system.\n(76) Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring that AI systems are resilient against attempts \nto alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by \nmalicious third parties exploiting the system\u2019s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks against AI \nsystems can leverage AI specific assets, such as training data sets (e.g. data poisoning) or \ntrained models (e.g. adversarial attacks or membership inference), or exploit \nvulnerabilities in the AI system\u2019s digital assets or the underlying ICT infrastructure. To \nensure a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks, suitable measures, such as security \ncontrols, should therefore be taken by the providers of high-risk AI systems, also taking \ninto account as appropriate the underlying ICT infrastructure.\n(77) Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set out in this \nRegulation, high-risk AI systems which fall within the scope of the Regulation (EU) \n2024/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council38+, in accordance with Article 8 \nof that Regulation may demonstrate compliance with the cybersecurity requirements of \nthis Regulation by fulfilling the essential cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 10 \nof, and Annex I to, Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026++.When high-risk AI systems fulfil the \nessential requirements of Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026++, they should be deemed compliant \nwith the cybersecurity requirements set out in this Regulation in so far as the \nachievement of those requirements is demonstrated in the EU declaration of conformity \nor parts thereof issued under Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026++. For this purpose, the \nassessment of the cybersecurity risks, associated to a product with digital elements \nclassified as high-risk AI system according to this Regulation, carried out under \nRegulation (EU) 2024/\u2026++, should consider risks to the cyber resilience of an AI system \nas regards attempts by unauthorised third parties to alter its use, behaviour or \nperformance, including AI specific vulnerabilities such as data poisoning or adversarial \nattacks, as well as, as relevant, risks to fundamental rights as required by this \nRegulation. \n38Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026 of the European Parliament and of the Council of \u2026 on horizontal \ncybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements and amending Regulation \n(EU) 2019/1020 (OJ L, \u2026, ELI: \u2026).\n+OJ: please, insert in the text the number of the Regulation in PE XX/YY (2022/0272(COD)) \nand complete the corresponding footnote.\n(78) The conformity assessment procedure provided by this Regulation should apply \nin relation to the essential cybersecurity requirements of a product with digital elements \ncovered by Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026+ and classified as a high-risk AI system under this \nRegulation. However, this rule should not result in reducing the necessary level of \nassurance for critical products with digital elements covered by Regulation (EU) \n2024/\u2026+. Therefore, by way of derogation from this rule, high-risk AI systems that fall \nwithin the scope of this Regulation and are also qualified as important and critical \nproducts with digital elements pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2024/\u2026+ and to which the \nconformity assessment procedure based on internal control set out in an annex to this \nRegulation applies, are subject to the conformity assessment provisions of Regulation \n(EU) 2024/\u2026+ insofar as the essential cybersecurity requirements of that Regulation are \nconcerned. In this case, for all the other aspects covered by this Regulation the \nrespective provisions on conformity assessment based on internal control set out in an \nannex to this Regulation should apply. Building on the knowledge and expertise of \nENISA on the cybersecurity policy and tasks assigned to ENISA under the Regulation \n(EU) 2019/1020, the Commission should cooperate with ENISA on issues related to \ncybersecurity of AI systems.\n+OJ: please, insert the number of the Regulation in PE XX/YY (2022/0272(COD)).\n()\n(79) It is appropriate that a specific natural or legal person, defined as the provider, takes the \nresponsibility for the placing on the market or the putting into service of a high-risk AI \nsystem, regardless of whether that natural or legal person is the person who designed or \ndeveloped the system.\n(80) As signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with \nDisabilities, the Union and the Member States are legally obliged to protect persons with \ndisabilities from discrimination and promote their equality, to ensure that persons with \ndisabilities have access, on an equal basis with others, to information and \ncommunications technologies and systems, and to ensure respect for privacy for persons \nwith disabilities. Given the growing importance and use of AI systems, the application of \nuniversal design principles to all new technologies and services should ensure full and \nequal access for everyone potentially affected by or using AI technologies, including \npersons with disabilities, in a way that takes full account of their inherent dignity and \ndiversity. It is therefore essential that providers ensure full compliance with accessibility \nrequirements, including Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council39 and Directive (EU) 2019/882. Providers should ensure compliance with \nthese requirements by design. Therefore, the necessary measures should be integrated as \nmuch as possible into the design of the high-risk AI system.\n39Directive (EU) 2016/2102 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October \n2016 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies (OJ \nL 327, 2.12.2016, p. 1).\n(81) The provider should establish a sound quality management system, ensure the \naccomplishment of the required conformity assessment procedure, draw up the relevant \ndocumentation and establish a robust post-market monitoring system. Providers of high-\nrisk AI systems that are subject to obligations regarding quality management systems \nunder relevant sectorial Union law should have the possibility to include the elements of \nthe quality management system provided for in this Regulation as part of the existing \nquality management system provided for in that other sectoral Union law. The \ncomplementarity between this Regulation and existing sectorial Union law should also \nbe taken into account in future standardisation activities or guidance adopted by the \nCommission. Public authorities which put into service high-risk AI systems for their own \nuse may adopt and implement the rules for the quality management system as part of the \nquality management system adopted at a national or regional level, as appropriate, taking \ninto account the specificities of the sector and the competences and organisation of the \npublic authority concerned.\n(82) To enable enforcement of this Regulation and create a level-playing field for operators, and \ntaking into account the different forms of making available of digital products, it is \nimportant to ensure that, under all circumstances, a person established in the Union can \nprovide authorities with all the necessary information on the compliance of an AI system. \nTherefore, prior to making their AI systems available in the Union, \u258c providers established \nin third countries shall, by written mandate, appoint an authorised representative \nestablished in the Union. This authorised representative plays a pivotal role in ensuring \nthe compliance of the high-risk AI systems placed on the market or put into service in \nthe Union by those providers who are not established in the Union and in serving as \ntheir contact person established in the Union.\n(83) In light of the nature and complexity of the value chain for AI systems and in line with \nthe New Legislative Framework, it is essential to ensure legal certainty and facilitate the \ncompliance with this Regulation. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the role and the \nspecific obligations of relevant operators along the value chain, such as importers and \ndistributors who may contribute to the development of AI systems. In certain situations \nthose operators could act in more than one role at the same time and should therefore \nfulfil cumulatively all relevant obligations associated with those roles. For example, an \noperator could act as a distributor and an importer at the same time.\n(84)To ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to clarify that, under certain specific conditions, \nany distributor, importer, deployer or other third-party should be considered to be a \nprovider of a high-risk AI system and therefore assume all the relevant obligations. This \nwould be the case if that party puts its name or trademark on a high-risk AI system \nalready placed on the market or put into service, without prejudice to contractual \narrangements stipulating that the obligations are allocated otherwise, or if that party \nmake a substantial modification to a high-risk AI system that has already been placed on \nthe market or has already been put into service and in a way that it remains a high-risk \nAI system in accordance with this Regulation, or if it modifies the intended purpose of \nan AI system, including a general-purpose AI system, which has not been classified as \nhigh-risk and has already been placed on the market or put into service, in a way that \nthe AI system becomes a high-risk AI system in accordance with this Regulation. Those \nprovisions should apply without prejudice to more specific provisions established in \ncertain Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, \ntogether with which this Regulation should apply. For example, Article 16(2) of \nRegulation (EU) 2017/745, establishing that certain changes should not be considered to \nbe modifications of a device that could affect its compliance with the applicable \nrequirements, should continue to apply to high-risk AI systems that are medical devices \nwithin the meaning of that Regulation.\n(85) General-purpose AI systems may be used as high-risk AI systems by themselves or be \ncomponents of other high-risk AI systems. Therefore, due to their particular nature and \nin order to ensure a fair sharing of responsibilities along the AI value chain, the \nproviders of such systems should, irrespective of whether they may be used as high-risk \nAI systems as such by other providers or as components of high-risk AI systems and \nunless provided otherwise under this Regulation, closely cooperate with the providers of \nthe relevant high-risk AI systems to enable their compliance with the relevant \nobligations under this Regulation and with the competent authorities established under \nthis Regulation.\n(86) Where, under the conditions laid down in this Regulation, the provider that initially \nplaced the AI system on the market or put it into service should no longer be considered \nto be the provider for the purposes of this Regulation, and when that provider has not \nexpressly excluded the change of the AI system into a high-risk AI system, the former \nprovider should nonetheless closely cooperate and make available the necessary \ninformation and provide the reasonably expected technical access and other assistance \nthat are required for the fulfilment of the obligations set out in this Regulation, in \nparticular regarding the compliance with the conformity assessment of high-risk AI \nsystems.\n(87) In addition, where a high-risk AI system that is a safety component of a product which \nfalls within the scope of Union harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative \nFramework is not placed on the market or put into service independently from the \nproduct, the product manufacturer defined in that legislation should comply with the \nobligations of the provider established in this Regulation and should, in particular, \nensure that the AI system embedded in the final product complies with the requirements \nof this Regulation.\n(88) Along the AI value chain multiple parties often supply AI systems, tools and services but \nalso components or processes that are incorporated by the provider into the AI system \nwith various objectives, including the model training, model retraining, model testing \nand evaluation, integration into software, or other aspects of model development. Those \nparties have an important role to play in the value chain towards the provider of the \nhigh-risk AI system into which their AI systems, tools, services, components or processes \nare integrated, and should provide by written agreement this provider with the necessary \ninformation, capabilities, technical access and other assistance based on the generally \nacknowledged state of the art, in order to enable the provider to fully comply with the \nobligations set out in this Regulation, without compromising their own intellectual \nproperty rights or trade secrets.\n(89) Third parties making accessible to the public tools, services, processes, or AI \ncomponents other than general-purpose AI models, shall not be mandated to comply \nwith requirements targeting the responsibilities along the AI value chain, in particular \ntowards the provider that has used or integrated them, when those tools, services, \nprocesses, or AI components are made accessible under a free and open licence. \nDevelopers of free and open-source tools, services, processes, or AI components other \nthan general-purpose AI models should be encouraged to implement widely adopted \ndocumentation practices, such as model cards and data sheets, as a way to accelerate \ninformation sharing along the AI value chain, allowing the promotion of trustworthy AI \nsystems in the Union.\n(90) The Commission could develop and recommend voluntary model contractual terms \nbetween providers of high-risk AI systems and third parties that supply tools, services, \ncomponents or processes that are used or integrated in high-risk AI systems, to facilitate \nthe cooperation along the value chain. When developing voluntary model contractual \nterms, the Commission should also take into account possible contractual requirements \napplicable in specific sectors or business cases.\n(91) Given the nature of AI systems and the risks to safety and fundamental rights possibly \nassociated with their use, including as regards the need to ensure proper monitoring of the \nperformance of an AI system in a real-life setting, it is appropriate to set specific \nresponsibilities for deployers. Deployers should in particular take appropriate technical \nand organisational measures to ensure they use high-risk AI systems in accordance with \nthe instructions of use and certain other obligations should be provided for with regard to \nmonitoring of the functioning of the AI systems and with regard to record-keeping, as \nappropriate. Furthermore, deployers should ensure that the persons assigned to \nimplement the instructions for use and human oversight as set out in this Regulation \nhave the necessary competence, in particular an adequate level of AI literacy, training \nand authority to properly fulfil those tasks. These obligations should be without \nprejudice to other deployer obligations in relation to high-risk AI systems under Union \nor national law.\n(92) This Regulation is without prejudice to obligations for employers to inform or to inform \nand consult workers or their representatives under Union or national law and practice, \nincluding Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council40 on a \ngeneral framework for informing and consulting employees, on decisions to put into \nservice or use AI systems. It remains necessary to ensure information of workers and \ntheir representatives on the planned deployment of high-risk AI systems at the workplace \nwhere the conditions for those information or information and consultation obligations \nin other legal instruments are not fulfilled. Moreover, such information right is ancillary \nand necessary to the objective of protecting fundamental rights that underlies this \nRegulation. Therefore, an information requirement to that effect should be laid down in \nthis Regulation, without affecting any existing rights of workers.\n40Directive 2002/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 \nestablishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European \nCommunity - Joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission \non employee representation (OJ L 80, 23.3.2002, p. 29).\n(93) Whilst risks related to AI systems can result from the way such systems are designed, \nrisks can as well stem from how such AI systems are used. Deployers of high-risk AI \nsystem therefore play a critical role in ensuring that fundamental rights are protected, \ncomplementing the obligations of the provider when developing the AI system. Deployers \nare best placed to understand how the high-risk AI system will be used concretely and \ncan therefore identify potential significant risks that were not foreseen in the \ndevelopment phase, due to a more precise knowledge of the context of use, the persons \nor groups of persons likely to be affected, including groups of vulnerable persons. \nDeployers of high-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation also play a \ncritical role in informing natural persons and should, when they make decisions or \nassist in making decisions related to natural persons, where applicable, inform the \nnatural persons that they are subject to the use of the high-risk AI system. This \ninformation should include the intended purpose and the type of decisions it makes. The \ndeployer should also inform the natural person about its right to an explanation \nprovided under this Regulation. With regard to high-risk AI systems used for law \nenforcement purposes, that obligation should be implemented in accordance with Article \n13 of Directive (EU) 2016/680.\n(94) Any processing of biometric data involved in the use of AI systems for biometric \nidentification for the purpose of law enforcement needs to comply with Article 10 of \nDirective (EU) 2016/680, that allows such processing only where strictly necessary, \nsubject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject, and \nwhere authorised by Union or Member State law. Such use, when authorized, also needs \nto respect the principles laid down in Article 4 (1) of Directive (EU) 2016/680 including \nlawfulness, fairness and transparency, purpose limitation, accuracy and storage \nlimitation.\n(95) Without prejudice to applicable Union law, in particular Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and \nDirective (EU) 2016/680, considering the intrusive nature of post remote biometric \nidentification systems, the use of post remote biometric identification systems shall be \nsubject to safeguards. Post biometric identification systems should always be used in a \nway that is proportionate, legitimate and strictly necessary, and thus targeted, in terms of \nthe individuals to be identified, the location, temporal scope and based on a closed data \nset of legally acquired video footage. In any case, post remote biometric identification \nsystems should not be used in the framework of law enforcement to lead to \nindiscriminate surveillance. The conditions for post remote biometric identification \nshould in any case not provide a basis to circumvent the conditions of the prohibition \nand strict exceptions for real time remote biometric identification.\n(96) In order to efficiently ensure that fundamental rights are protected, deployers of high-\nrisk AI systems that are bodies governed by public law, or private operators providing \npublic services and operators deploying certain high-risk AI systems listed in an annex \nto this Regulation, such as banking or insurance entities, should carry out a \nfundamental rights impact assessment prior to putting it into use. Services important for \nindividuals that are of public nature may also be provided by private entities. Private \noperators providing such services of public nature are linked to tasks in the public \ninterest such as in the area of education, healthcare, social services, housing, \nadministration of justice. The aim of the fundamental rights impact assessment is for the \ndeployer to identify the specific risks to the rights of individuals or groups of individuals \nlikely to be affected, identify measures to be taken in the case of a materialisation of \nthose risk. The impact assessment should apply to the first use of the high-risk AI \nsystem, and should be updated when the deployer considers that any of the relevant \nfactors have changed. The impact assessment should identify the deployer\u2019s relevant \nprocesses in which the high-risk AI system will be used in line with its intended purpose, \nand should include a description of the period of time and frequency in which the system \nis intended to be used as well as of specific categories of natural persons and groups who \nare likely to be affected in the specific context of use. \nThe assessment should also include the identification of specific risks of harm likely to \nhave an impact on the fundamental rights of those persons or groups. While performing \nthis assessment, the deployer should take into account information relevant to a proper \nassessment of the impact, including but not limited to the information given by the \nprovider of the high-risk AI system in the instructions for use. In light of the risks \nidentified, deployers should determine measures to be taken in the case of a \nmaterialisation of those risks, including for example governance arrangements in that \nspecific context of use, such as arrangements for human oversight according to the \ninstructions of use or, complaint handling and redress procedures, as they could be \ninstrumental in mitigating risks to fundamental rights in concrete use-cases. After \nperforming that impact assessment, the deployer should notify the relevant market \nsurveillance authority. Where appropriate, to collect relevant information necessary to \nperform the impact assessment, deployers of high-risk AI system, in particular when AI \nsystems are used in the public sector, could involve relevant stakeholders, including the \nrepresentatives of groups of persons likely to be affected by the AI system, independent \nexperts, and civil society organisations in conducting such impact assessments and \ndesigning measures to be taken in the case of materialisation of the risks. The European \nArtificial Intelligence Office (\u2018AI Office\u2019) should develop a template for a questionnaire \nin order to facilitate compliance and reduce the administrative burden for deployers.\n(97) The notion of general-purpose AI models should be clearly defined and set apart from \nthe notion of AI systems to enable legal certainty. The definition should be based on the \nkey functional characteristics of a general-purpose AI model, in particular the generality \nand the capability to competently perform a wide range of distinct tasks. These models \nare typically trained on large amounts of data, through various methods, such as self-\nsupervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. General-purpose AI models may be \nplaced on the market in various ways, including through libraries, application \nprogramming interfaces (APIs), as direct download, or as physical copy. These models \nmay be further modified or fine-tuned into new models. Although AI models are \nessential components of AI systems, they do not constitute AI systems on their own. AI \nmodels require the addition of further components, such as for example a user interface, \nto become AI systems. AI models are typically integrated into and form part of AI \nsystems. This Regulation provides specific rules for general-purpose AI models and for \ngeneral-purpose AI models that pose systemic risks, which should apply also when these \nmodels are integrated or form part of an AI system. It should be understood that the \nobligations for the providers of general-purpose AI models should apply once the \ngeneral-purpose AI models are placed on the market. \nWhen the provider of a general-purpose AI model integrates an own model into its own \nAI system that is made available on the market or put into service, that model should be \nconsidered to be placed on the market and, therefore, the obligations in this Regulation \nfor models should continue to apply in addition to those for AI systems. The obligations \nlaid down for models should in any case not apply when an own model is used for purely \ninternal processes that are not essential for providing a product or a service to third \nparties and the rights of natural persons are not affected. Considering their potential \nsignificantly negative effects, the general-purpose AI models with systemic risk should \nalways be subject to the relevant obligations under this Regulation. The definition \nshould not cover AI models used before their placing on the market for the sole purpose \nof research, development and prototyping activities. This is without prejudice to the \nobligation to comply with this Regulation when, following such activities, a model is \nplaced on the market.\n(98) Whereas the generality of a model could, among other criteria, also be determined by a \nnumber of parameters, models with at least a billion of parameters and trained with a \nlarge amount of data using self-supervision at scale should be considered to display \nsignificant generality and to competently perform a wide range of distinctive tasks.\n(99) Large generative AI models are a typical example for a general-purpose AI model, given \nthat they allow for flexible generation of content, such as in the form of text, audio, \nimages or video, that can readily accommodate a wide range of distinctive tasks.\n(100) When a general-purpose AI model is integrated into or forms part of an AI system, this \nsystem should be considered to be general-purpose AI system when, due to this \nintegration, this system has the capability to serve a variety of purposes. A general-\npurpose AI system can be used directly, or it may be integrated into other AI systems.\n(101) Providers of general-purpose AI models have a particular role and responsibility along \nthe AI value chain, as the models they provide may form the basis for a range of \ndownstream systems, often provided by downstream providers that necessitate a good \nunderstanding of the models and their capabilities, both to enable the integration of such \nmodels into their products, and to fulfil their obligations under this or other regulations. \nTherefore, proportionate transparency measures should be laid down, including the \ndrawing up and keeping up to date of documentation, and the provision of information \non the general-purpose AI model for its usage by the downstream providers. Technical \ndocumentation should be prepared and kept up to date by the general-purpose AI model \nprovider for the purpose of making it available, upon request, to the AI Office and the \nnational competent authorities. The minimal set of elements to be included in such \ndocumentation should be set out in annexes to this Regulation. The Commission should \nbe empowered to amend those annexes by means of delegated acts in the light of \nevolving technological developments.\n(102) Software and data, including models, released under a free and open-source licence that \nallows them to be openly shared and where users can freely access, use, modify and \nredistribute them or modified versions thereof, can contribute to research and \ninnovation in the market and can provide significant growth opportunities for the Union \neconomy. General-purpose AI models released under free and open-source licences \nshould be considered to ensure high levels of transparency and openness if their \nparameters, including the weights, the information on the model architecture, and the \ninformation on model usage are made publicly available. The licence should be \nconsidered to be free and open-source also when it allows users to run, copy, distribute, \nstudy, change and improve software and data, including models under the condition that \nthe original provider of the model is credited, the identical or comparable terms of \ndistribution are respected. \n(103) Free and open-source AI components covers the software and data, including models \nand general-purpose AI models, tools, services or processes of an AI system. Free and \nopen-source AI components can be provided through different channels, including their \ndevelopment on open repositories. For the purposes of this Regulation, AI components \nthat are provided against a price or otherwise monetised, including through the \nprovision of technical support or other services, including through a software platform, \nrelated to the AI component, or the use of personal data for reasons other than \nexclusively for improving the security, compatibility or interoperability of the software, \nwith the exception of transactions between microenterprises, should not benefit from the \nexceptions provided to free and open source AI components. The fact of making AI \ncomponents available through open repositories should not, in itself, constitute a \nmonetisation.\n(104) The providers of general-purpose AI models that are released under a free and open \nsource license, and whose parameters, including the weights, the information on the \nmodel architecture, and the information on model usage, are made publicly available \nshould be subject to exceptions as regards the transparency-related requirements \nimposed on general-purpose AI models, unless they can be considered to present a \nsystemic risk, in which case the circumstance that the model is transparent and \naccompanied by an open source license should not be considered to be a sufficient \nreason to exclude compliance with the obligations under this Regulation. In any case, \ngiven that the release of general-purpose AI models under free and open source licence \ndoes not necessarily reveal substantial information on the data set used for the training \nor fine-tuning of the model and on how compliance of copyright law was thereby \nensured, the exception provided for general-purpose AI models from compliance with \nthe transparency-related requirements should not concern the obligation to produce a \nsummary about the content used for model training and the obligation to put in place a \npolicy to comply with Union copyright law, in particular to identify and comply with the \nreservation of rights pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council41.\n41Directive (EU) 2019/790 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on \ncopyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market and amending Directives 96/9/EC \nand 2001/29/EC (OJ L 130, 17.5.2019, p. 92).\n(105) General-purpose models, in particular large generative models, capable of generating \ntext, images, and other content, present unique innovation opportunities but also \nchallenges to artists, authors, and other creators and the way their creative content is \ncreated, distributed, used and consumed. The development and training of such models \nrequire access to vast amounts of text, images, videos, and other data. Text and data \nmining techniques may be used extensively in this context for the retrieval and analysis \nof such content, which may be protected by copyright and related rights. Any use of \ncopyright protected content requires the authorisation of the rightsholder concerned \nunless relevant copyright exceptions and limitations apply. Directive (EU) 2019/790 \nintroduced exceptions and limitations allowing reproductions and extractions of works \nor other subject matter, for the purpose of text and data mining, under certain \nconditions. Under these rules, rightsholders may choose to reserve their rights over their \nworks or other subject matter to prevent text and data mining, unless this is done for the \npurposes of scientific research. Where the rights to opt out has been expressly reserved \nin an appropriate manner, providers of general-purpose AI models need to obtain an \nauthorisation from rightsholders if they want to carry out text and data mining over \nsuch works.\n(106) Providers that place general-purpose AI models on the Union market should ensure \ncompliance with the relevant obligations in this Regulation. To that end, providers of \ngeneral-purpose AI models should put in place a policy to comply with Union law on \ncopyright and related rights, in particular to identify and comply with the reservations of \nrights expressed by rightsholders pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790. \nAny provider placing a general-purpose AI model on the Union market should comply \nwith this obligation, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the copyright-relevant acts \nunderpinning the training of those general-purpose AI models take place. This is \nnecessary to ensure a level playing field among providers of general-purpose AI models \nwhere no provider should be able to gain a competitive advantage in the Union market \nby applying lower copyright standards than those provided in the Union.\n(107) In order to increase transparency on the data that is used in the pre-training and \ntraining of general-purpose AI models, including text and data protected by copyright \nlaw, it is adequate that providers of such models draw up and make publicly available a \nsufficiently detailed summary of the content used for training the general-purpose \nmodel. While taking into due account the need to protect trade secrets and confidential \nbusiness information, this summary should be generally comprehensive in its scope \ninstead of technically detailed to facilitate parties with legitimate interests, including \ncopyright holders, to exercise and enforce their rights under Union law, for example by \nlisting the main data collections or sets that went into training the model, such as large \nprivate or public databases or data archives, and by providing a narrative explanation \nabout other data sources used. It is appropriate for the AI Office to provide a template \nfor the summary, which should be simple, effective, and allow the provider to provide the \nrequired summary in narrative form.\n(108) With regard to the obligations imposed on providers of general-purpose AI models to put \nin place a policy to comply with Union copyright law and make publicly available a \nsummary of the content used for the training, the AI Office should monitor whether the \nprovider has fulfilled those obligations without verifying or proceeding to a work-by-\nwork assessment of the training data in terms of copyright compliance. This Regulation \ndoes not affect the enforcement of copyright rules as provided for under Union law.\n(109) Compliance with the obligations applicable to the providers of general-purpose AI \nmodels should be commensurate and proportionate to the type of model provider, \nexcluding the need for compliance for persons who develop or use models for non-\nprofessional or scientific research purposes, who should nevertheless be encouraged to \nvoluntarily comply with these requirements. Without prejudice to Union copyright law, \ncompliance with these obligations should take due account of the size of the provider \nand allow simplified ways of compliance for SMEs, including start-ups, that should not \nrepresent an excessive cost and not discourage the use of such models. In the case of a \nmodification or fine-tuning of a model, the obligations for providers should be limited to \nthat modification or fine-tuning, for example by complementing the already existing \ntechnical documentation with information on the modifications, including new training \ndata sources, as a means to comply with the value chain obligations provided in this \nRegulation.\n(110) General-purpose AI models could pose systemic risks which include, but are not limited \nto, any actual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects in relation to major accidents, \ndisruptions of critical sectors and serious consequences to public health and safety; any \nactual or reasonably foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, public and \neconomic security; the dissemination of illegal, false, or discriminatory content. \nSystemic risks should be understood to increase with model capabilities and model \nreach, can arise along the entire lifecycle of the model, and are influenced by conditions \nof misuse, model reliability, model fairness and model security, the degree of autonomy \nof the model, its access to tools, novel or combined modalities, release and distribution \nstrategies, the potential to remove guardrails and other factors. In particular, \ninternational approaches have so far identified the need to devote attention to risks from \npotential intentional misuse or unintended issues of control relating to alignment with \nhuman intent; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks, such as the ways in \nwhich barriers to entry can be lowered, including for weapons development, design \nacquisition, or use; offensive cyber capabilities, such as the ways in vulnerability \ndiscovery, exploitation, or operational use can be enabled; the effects of interaction and \ntool use, including for example the capacity to control physical systems and interfere \nwith critical infrastructure; risks from models of making copies of themselves or \u2018self-\nreplicating\u2019 or training other models; the ways in which models can give rise to harmful \nbias and discrimination with risks to individuals, communities or societies; the \nfacilitation of disinformation or harming privacy with threats to democratic values and \nhuman rights; risk that a particular event could lead to a chain reaction with \nconsiderable negative effects that could affect up to an entire city, an entire domain \nactivity or an entire community.\n(111) It is appropriate to establish a methodology for the classification of general-purpose AI \nmodels as general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. Since systemic risks result from \nparticularly high capabilities, a general-purpose AI model should be considered to \npresent systemic risks if it has high-impact capabilities, evaluated on the basis of \nappropriate technical tools and methodologies, or significant impact on the internal \nmarket due to its reach. High-impact capabilities in general-purpose AI models means \ncapabilities that match or exceed the capabilities recorded in the most advanced general-\npurpose AI models. The full range of capabilities in a model could be better understood \nafter its release on the market or when users interact with the model. According to the \nstate of the art at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, the cumulative amount \nof compute used for the training of the general-purpose AI model measured in floating \npoint operations (\u2018FLOPs\u2019) is one of the relevant approximations for model capabilities. \nThe amount of compute used for training cumulates the compute used across the \nactivities and methods that are intended to enhance the capabilities of the model prior to \ndeployment, such as pre-training, synthetic data generation and fine-tuning. Therefore, \nan initial threshold of FLOPs should be set, which, if met by a general-purpose AI \nmodel, leads to a presumption that the model is a general-purpose AI model with \nsystemic risks. This threshold should be adjusted over time to reflect technological and \nindustrial changes, such as algorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, \nand should be supplemented with benchmarks and indicators for model capability. \nTo inform this, the AI Office should engage with the scientific community, industry, civil \nsociety and other experts. Thresholds, as well as tools and benchmarks for the \nassessment of high-impact capabilities, should be strong predictors of generality, its \ncapabilities and associated systemic risk of general-purpose AI models, and could take \ninto taking into account the way the model will be placed on the market or the number of \nusers it may affect. To complement this system, there should be a possibility for the \nCommission to take individual decisions designating a general-purpose AI model as a \ngeneral-purpose AI model with systemic risk if it is found that such model has \ncapabilities or an impact equivalent to those captured by the set threshold. That decision \nshould be taken on the basis of an overall assessment of the criteria for the designation \nof general-purpose AI models with systemic risk set out in an annex to this Regulation, \nsuch as quality or size of the training data set, number of business and end users, its \ninput and output modalities, its degree of autonomy and scalability, or the tools it has \naccess to. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a \ngeneral-purpose AI model with systemic risk, the Commission should take the request \ninto account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI model can still \nbe considered to present systemic risks.\n(112) It is also necessary to clarify a procedure for the classification of a general-purpose AI \nmodel with systemic risks. A general-purpose AI model that meets the applicable \nthreshold for high-impact capabilities should be presumed to be a general-purpose AI \nmodels with systemic risk. The provider should notify the AI Office at the latest two \nweeks after the requirements are met or it becomes known that a general-purpose AI \nmodel will meet the requirements that lead to the presumption. This is especially relevant \nin relation to the FLOP threshold because training of general-purpose AI models takes \nconsiderable planning which includes the upfront allocation of compute resources and, \ntherefore, providers of general-purpose AI models are able to know if their model would \nmeet the threshold before the training is completed. In the context of that notification, \nthe provider should be able to demonstrate that, because of its specific characteristics, a \ngeneral-purpose AI model exceptionally does not present systemic risks, and that it thus \nshould not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic risks. That \ninformation is valuable for the AI Office to anticipate the placing on the market of \ngeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risks and the providers can start to engage with \nthe AI Office early on. That information is especially important with regard to general-\npurpose AI models that are planned to be released as open-source, given that, after \nopen-source model release, necessary measures to ensure compliance with the \nobligations under this Regulation may be more difficult to implement.\n(113) If the Commission becomes aware of the fact that a general-purpose AI model meets the \nrequirements to classify as a general-purpose model with systemic risk, which previously \nhad either not been known or of which the relevant provider has failed to notify the \nCommission, the Commission should be empowered to designate it so. A system of \nqualified alerts should ensure that the AI Office is made aware by the scientific panel of \ngeneral-purpose AI models that should possibly be classified as general-purpose AI \nmodels with systemic risk, in addition to the monitoring activities of the AI Office.\n(114) The providers of general-purpose AI models presenting systemic risks should be subject, \nin addition to the obligations provided for providers of general-purpose AI models, to \nobligations aimed at identifying and mitigating those risks and ensuring an adequate \nlevel of cybersecurity protection, regardless of whether it is provided as a standalone \nmodel or embedded in an AI system or a product. To achieve those objectives, this \nRegulation should require providers to perform the necessary model evaluations, in \nparticular prior to its first placing on the market, including conducting and documenting \nadversarial testing of models, also, as appropriate, through internal or independent \nexternal testing. In addition, providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks \nshould continuously assess and mitigate systemic risks, including for example by putting \nin place risk-management policies, such as accountability and governance processes, \nimplementing post-market monitoring, taking appropriate measures along the entire \nmodel\u2019s lifecycle and cooperating with relevant actors along the AI value chain.\n(115) Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risks should assess and mitigate \npossible systemic risks. If, despite efforts to identify and prevent risks related to a \ngeneral-purpose AI model that may present systemic risks, the development or use of the \nmodel causes a serious incident, the general-purpose AI model provider should without \nundue delay keep track of the incident and report any relevant information and possible \ncorrective measures to the Commission and national competent authorities. \nFurthermore, providers should ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for \nthe model and its physical infrastructure, if appropriate, along the entire model lifecycle. \nCybersecurity protection related to systemic risks associated with malicious use of or \nattacks should duly consider accidental model leakage, unauthorised releases, \ncircumvention of safety measures, and defence against cyberattacks, unauthorised \naccess or model theft. That protection could be facilitated by securing model weights, \nalgorithms, servers, and data sets, such as through operational security measures for \ninformation security, specific cybersecurity policies, adequate technical and established \nsolutions, and cyber and physical access controls, appropriate to the relevant \ncircumstances and the risks involved.\n(116) The AI Office should encourage and facilitate the drawing up, review and adaptation of \ncodes of practice, taking into account international approaches. All providers of general-\npurpose AI models could be invited to participate. To ensure that the codes of practice \nreflect the state of the art and duly take into account a diverse set of perspectives, the AI \nOffice should collaborate with relevant national competent authorities, and could, where \nappropriate, consult with civil society organisations and other relevant stakeholders and \nexperts, including the Scientific Panel, for the drawing up of such codes. Codes of \npractice should cover obligations for providers of general-purpose AI models and of \ngeneral-purpose models presenting systemic risks. In addition, as regards systemic risks, \ncodes of practice should help to establish a risk taxonomy of the type and nature of the \nsystemic risks at Union level, including their sources. Codes of practice should also be \nfocused on specific risk assessment and mitigation measures.\n(117) The codes of practice should represent a central tool for the proper compliance with the \nobligations provided for under this Regulation for providers of general-purpose AI \nmodels. Providers should be able to rely on codes of practice to demonstrate compliance \nwith the obligations. By means of implementing acts, the Commission may decide to \napprove a code of practice and give it a general validity within the Union, or, \nalternatively, to provide common rules for the implementation of the relevant \nobligations, if, by the time this Regulation becomes applicable, a code of practice cannot \nbe finalised or is not deemed adequate by the AI Office. Once a harmonised standard is \npublished and assessed as suitable to cover the relevant obligations by the AI Office, the \ncompliance with a European harmonised standard should grant providers the \npresumption of conformity. Providers of general-purpose AI models should furthermore \nbe able to demonstrate compliance using alternative adequate means, if codes of practice \nor harmonized standards are not available, or they choose not to rely on those.\n(118) This Regulation regulates AI systems and models by imposing certain requirements and \nobligations for relevant market actors that are placing them on the market, putting into \nservice or use in the Union, thereby complementing obligations for providers of \nintermediary services that embed such systems or models into their services regulated by \nRegulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council42. To the \nextent that such systems or models are embedded into designated very large online \nplatforms or very large online search engines, they are subject to the risk-management \nframework provided for in Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. Consequently, the corresponding \nobligations of this Regulation should be presumed to be fulfilled, unless significant \nsystemic risks not covered by Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 emerge and are identified in \nsuch models. Within this framework, providers of very large online platforms and very \nlarge online search engines are obliged to assess potential systemic risks stemming from \nthe design, functioning and use of their services, including how the design of \nalgorithmic systems used in the service may contribute to such risks, as well as systemic \nrisks stemming from potential misuses. Those providers are also obliged to take \nappropriate mitigating measures in observance of fundamental rights.\n42Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 October \n2022 on a Single Market For Digital Services and amending Directive 2000/31/EC (Digital \nServices Act) (OJ L 277, 27.10.2022, p. 1).\n(119) Considering the quick pace of innovation and the technological evolution of digital \nservices in scope of different instruments of Union law in particular having in mind the \nusage and the perception of their recipients, the AI systems subject to this Regulation \nmay be provided as intermediary services or parts thereof within the meaning of \nRegulation (EU) 2022/2065, which should be interpreted in a technology-neutral \nmanner. For example, AI systems may be used to provide online search engines, in \nparticular, to the extent that an AI system such as an online chatbot performs searches \nof, in principle, all websites, then incorporates the results into its existing knowledge and \nuses the updated knowledge to generate a single output that combines different sources \nof information.\n(120) Furthermore, obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this \nRegulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are \nartificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective \nimplementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the \nobligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search \nengines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of \ncontent that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the \nactual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and \nelectoral processes, including through disinformation.\n(121) Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions to providers to ensure \ncompliance with this Regulation, in line with the state of the art, to promote innovation as \nwell as competitiveness and growth in the single market. Compliance with harmonised \nstandards as defined in Article 2, point (1)(c), of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the \nEuropean Parliament and of the Council43, which are normally expected to reflect the \nstate of the art, should be a means for providers to demonstrate conformity with the \nrequirements of this Regulation. A balanced representation of interests involving all \nrelevant stakeholders in the development of standards, in particular SMEs, consumer \norganisations and environmental and social stakeholders in accordance with Articles 5 \nand 6 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 should therefore be encouraged. In order to \nfacilitate compliance, the standardisation requests should be issued by the Commission \nwithout undue delay. When preparing the standardisation request, the Commission \nshould consult the advisory forum and the Board in order to collect relevant expertise. \nHowever, In the absence of relevant references to harmonised standards, the \nCommission should be able to establish, via implementing acts, and after consultation of \nthe advisory forum, common specifications for certain requirements under this \nRegulation. \n43Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 \nOctober 2012 on European standardisation, amending Council Directives 89/686/EEC and \n93/15/EEC and Directives 94/9/EC, 94/25/EC, 95/16/EC, 97/23/EC, 98/34/EC, 2004/22/EC, \n2007/23/EC, 2009/23/EC and 2009/105/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council \nand repealing Council Decision 87/95/EEC and Decision No 1673/2006/EC of the European \nParliament and of the Council (OJ L 316, 14.11.2012, p. 12).\nThe common specification should be an exceptional fall back solution to facilitate the \nprovider\u2019s obligation to comply with the requirements of this Regulation, when the \nstandardisation request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation \norganisations, or when the relevant harmonized standards insufficiently address \nfundamental rights concerns, or when the harmonised standards do not comply with the \nrequest, or when there are delays in the adoption of an appropriate harmonised \nstandard. Where such a delay in the adoption of a harmonised standard is due to the \ntechnical complexity of that standard, this should be considered by the Commission \nbefore contemplating the establishment of common specifications. When developing \ncommon specifications, the Commission is encouraged to cooperate with international \npartners and international standardisation bodies.\n(122) It is appropriate that, without prejudice to the use of harmonised standards and common \nspecifications, providers of high-risk AI system that has been trained and tested on data \nreflecting the specific geographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within \nwhich the AI system is intended to be used, should be presumed to comply with the \nrelevant measure provided for under the requirement on data governance set out in this \nRegulation. Without prejudice to the requirements related to robustness and accuracy set \nout in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 54(3) of Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of \nthe European Parliament and of the Council44, high-risk AI systems that have been \ncertified or for which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity \nscheme pursuant to that Regulation and the references of which have been published in \nthe Official Journal of the European Union should be presumed to comply with the \ncybersecurity requirement of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or \nstatement of conformity or parts thereof cover the cybersecurity requirement of this \nRegulation This remains without prejudice to the voluntary nature of that cybersecurity \nscheme.\n(123) In order to ensure a high level of trustworthiness of high-risk AI systems, those systems \nshould be subject to a conformity assessment prior to their placing on the market or putting \ninto service.\n44Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 \non ENISA (the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity) and on information and \ncommunications technology cybersecurity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No \n526/2013 (Cybersecurity Act) (OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15).\n(124) It is appropriate that, in order to minimise the burden on operators and avoid any possible \nduplication, for high-risk AI systems related to products which are covered by existing \nUnion harmonisation legislation based on the New Legislative Framework, the compliance \nof those AI systems with the requirements of this Regulation should be assessed as part of \nthe conformity assessment already provided for in that law. The applicability of the \nrequirements of this Regulation should thus not affect the specific logic, methodology or \ngeneral structure of conformity assessment under the relevant Union harmonisation \nlegislation. \u258c\n(125) Given the complexity of high-risk AI systems and the risks that are associated to them, it \nis important to develop an adequate system of conformity assessment procedure for high-\nrisk AI systems involving notified bodies, so called third party conformity assessment. \nHowever, given the current experience of professional pre-market certifiers in the field of \nproduct safety and the different nature of risks involved, it is appropriate to limit, at least in \nan initial phase of application of this Regulation, the scope of application of third-party \nconformity assessment for high-risk AI systems other than those related to products. \nTherefore, the conformity assessment of such systems should be carried out as a general \nrule by the provider under its own responsibility, with the only exception of AI systems \nintended to be used for biometrics.\n(126) In order to carry out third-party conformity assessments when so required, notified bodies \nshould be notified under this Regulation by the national competent authorities, provided \nthat they comply with a set of requirements, in particular on independence, competence, \nabsence of conflicts of interests and suitable cybersecurity requirements. Notification of \nthose bodies should be sent by national competent authorities to the Commission and the \nother Member States by means of the electronic notification tool developed and managed \nby the Commission pursuant to Article R23 of Annex I to Decision No 768/2008/EC.\n(127) In line with Union commitments under the World Trade Organization Agreement on \nTechnical Barriers to Trade, it is adequate to facilitate the mutual recognition of \nconformity assessment results produced by competent conformity assessment bodies, \nindependent of the territory in which they are established, provided that those conformity \nassessment bodies established under the law of a third country meet the applicable \nrequirements of this Regulation and the Union has concluded an agreement to that \nextent. In this context, the Commission should actively explore possible international \ninstruments for that purpose and in particular pursue the conclusion of mutual \nrecognition agreements with third countries.\n(128) In line with the commonly established notion of substantial modification for products \nregulated by Union harmonisation legislation, it is appropriate that \u258c whenever a change \noccurs which may affect the compliance of a high-risk AI system with this Regulation \n(e.g. change of operating system or software architecture), or when the intended purpose \nof the system changes, that AI system should be considered to be a new AI system which \nshould undergo a new conformity assessment. However, changes occurring to the \nalgorithm and the performance of AI systems which continue to \u2018learn\u2019 after being placed \non the market or put into service, namely \u258c automatically adapting how functions are \ncarried out, should not constitute a substantial modification, provided that those changes \nhave been pre-determined by the provider and assessed at the moment of the conformity \nassessment \u258c.\n(129) High-risk AI systems should bear the CE marking to indicate their conformity with this \nRegulation so that they can move freely within the internal market. For high-risk AI \nsystems embedded in a product, a physical CE marking should be affixed, and may be \ncomplemented by a digital CE marking. For high-risk AI systems only provided digitally, \na digital CE marking should be used. Member States should not create unjustified \nobstacles to the placing on the market or the putting into service of high-risk AI systems \nthat comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation and bear the CE marking.\n(130) Under certain conditions, rapid availability of innovative technologies may be crucial for \nhealth and safety of persons, the protection of the environment and climate change and \nfor society as a whole. It is thus appropriate that under exceptional reasons of public \nsecurity or protection of life and health of natural persons, environmental protection and \nthe protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets, market surveillance \nauthorities could authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of AI \nsystems which have not undergone a conformity assessment. In a duly justified situations \nas provided under this Regulation, law enforcement authorities or civil protection \nauthorities may put a specific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation \nof the market surveillance authority, provided that such authorisation is requested \nduring or after the use without undue delay.\n(131) In order to facilitate the work of the Commission and the Member States in the AI field as \nwell as to increase the transparency towards the public, providers of high-risk AI systems \nother than those related to products falling within the scope of relevant existing Union \nharmonisation legislation, as well as providers who consider that the high-risk AI system \nlisted in an annex to this Regulation is not high-risk on the basis of a derogation, should \nbe required to register themselves and information about their AI system in a EU \ndatabase, to be established and managed by the Commission. Before using such a high-\nrisk AI system, deployers of high-risk AI systems that are public authorities, agencies or \nbodies, should register themselves in such database and select the system that they \nenvisage to use. \nOther deployers should be entitled to do so voluntarily. This section of the database \nshould be publicly accessible, free of charge, the information should be easily navigable, \nunderstandable and machine-readable. The database should also be user-friendly, for \nexample by providing search functionalities, including through keywords, allowing the \ngeneral public to find relevant information to be submitted upon the registration of high-\nrisk AI systems and on the high-risk AI systems, set out in annexes to this Regulation, to \nwhich the high-risk AI systems correspond. Any substantial modification of high-risk AI \nsystems should also be registered in the EU database. For high-risk AI systems in the \narea of law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the \nregistration obligations should be fulfilled in a secure non-public section of the \ndatabase. Access to the secure non-public section should be strictly limited to the \nCommission as well as to market surveillance authorities with regard to their national \nsection of that database. High-risk AI systems in the area of critical infrastructure \nshould only be registered at national level. The Commission should be the controller of \nthe EU database, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2018/1725. In order to ensure the \nfull functionality of the database, when deployed, the procedure for setting the database \nshould include the elaboration of functional specifications by the Commission and an \nindependent audit report. The Commission should take into account cybersecurity and \nhazard-related risks when carrying out its tasks as data controller on the EU database. \nIn order to maximise the availability and use of the database by the public, the database, \nincluding the information made available through it, should comply with requirements \nunder the Directive (EU) 2019/882.\n(132) Certain AI systems intended to interact with natural persons or to generate content may \npose specific risks of impersonation or deception irrespective of whether they qualify as \nhigh-risk or not. In certain circumstances, the use of these systems should therefore be \nsubject to specific transparency obligations without prejudice to the requirements and \nobligations for high-risk AI systems and subject to targeted exceptions to take into \naccount the special need of law enforcement. In particular, natural persons should be \nnotified that they are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of \nview of a natural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect \ntaking into account the circumstances and the context of use. When implementing such \nobligation, the characteristics of individuals belonging to groups of vulnerable persons \ndue to their age or disability should be taken into account to the extent the AI system is \nintended to interact with those groups as well. Moreover, natural persons should be \nnotified when they are exposed to systems that, by processing their biometric data, can \nidentify or infer the emotions or intentions of those persons or assign them to specific \ncategories. Such specific categories can relate to aspects such as sex, age, hair colour, \neye colour, tattoos, personal traits, ethnic origin, personal preferences and interests. \nSuch information and notifications should be provided in accessible formats for persons \nwith disabilities.\n(133) A variety of AI systems can generate large quantities of synthetic content that becomes \nincreasingly hard for humans to distinguish from human-generated and authentic \ncontent. The wide availability and increasing capabilities of those systems have a \nsignificant impact on the integrity and trust in the information ecosystem, raising new \nrisks of misinformation and manipulation at scale, fraud, impersonation and consumer \ndeception. In light of those impacts, the fast technological pace and the need for new \nmethods and techniques to trace origin of information, it is appropriate to require \nproviders of those systems to embed technical solutions that enable marking in a \nmachine readable format and detection that the output has been generated or \nmanipulated by an AI system and not a human. Such techniques and methods should be \nsufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust as far as this is technically \nfeasible, taking into account available techniques or a combination of such techniques, \nsuch as watermarks, metadata identifications, cryptographic methods for proving \nprovenance and authenticity of content, logging methods, fingerprints or other \ntechniques, as may be appropriate. When implementing this obligation, providers should \nalso take into account the specificities and the limitations of the different types of \ncontent and the relevant technological and market developments in the field, as reflected \nin the generally acknowledged state-of-the-art. Such techniques and methods can be \nimplemented at the level of the system or at the level of the model, including general-\npurpose AI models generating content, thereby facilitating fulfilment of this obligation \nby the downstream provider of the AI system. To remain proportionate, it is appropriate \nto envisage that this marking obligation should not cover AI systems performing \nprimarily an assistive function for standard editing or AI systems not substantially \naltering the input data provided by the deployer or the semantics thereof.\n(134) Further to the technical solutions employed by the providers of the system, deployers, \nwho use an AI system to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content that \nappreciably resembles existing persons, places or events and would falsely appear to a \nperson to be authentic (deep fakes), should also clearly and distinguishably disclose that \nthe content has been artificially created or manipulated by labelling the artificial \nintelligence output accordingly and disclosing its artificial origin The compliance with \nthis transparency obligation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the \nsystem or its output impedes the right to freedom of expression and the right to freedom \nof the arts and sciences guaranteed in the Charter, in particular where the content is \npart of an evidently creative, satirical, artistic or fictional work or programme, subject to \nappropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties. In those cases, the \ntransparency obligation for deep fakes set out in this Regulation is limited to disclosure \nof the existence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that \ndoes not hamper the display or enjoyment of the work, including its normal exploitation \nand use, while maintaining the utility and quality of the work. In addition, it is also \nappropriate to envisage a similar disclosure obligation in relation to AI-generated or \nmanipulated text to the extent it is published with the purpose of informing the public on \nmatters of public interest unless the AI-generated content has undergone a process of \nhuman review or editorial control and a natural or legal person holds editorial \nresponsibility for the publication of the content.\n(135) To ensure consistent implementation, it is appropriate to empower the Commission to \nadopt implementing acts on the application of the provisions on the labelling and \ndetection of artificially generated or manipulated content. Without prejudice to the \nmandatory nature and full applicability of the transparency obligations, the Commission \nmay also encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at Union level to \nfacilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the detection and \nlabelling of artificially generated or manipulated content, including to support practical \narrangements for making, as appropriate, the detection mechanisms accessible and \nfacilitating cooperation with other actors along the value chain, disseminating content \nor checking its authenticity and provenance to enable the public to effectively distinguish \nAI-generated content.\n(136) The obligations placed on providers and deployers of certain AI systems in this \nRegulation to enable the detection and disclosure that the outputs of those systems are \nartificially generated or manipulated are particularly relevant to facilitate the effective \nimplementation of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065. This applies in particular as regards the \nobligations of providers of very large online platforms or very large online search \nengines to identify and mitigate systemic risks that may arise from the dissemination of \ncontent that has been artificially generated or manipulated, in particular risk of the \nactual or foreseeable negative effects on democratic processes, civic discourse and \nelectoral processes, including through disinformation. The requirement to label content \ngenerated by AI systems under this Regulation is without prejudice to the obligation in \nArticle 16(6) of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 for providers of hosting services to process \nnotices on illegal content received pursuant to Article 16(1) of that Regulation and \nshould not influence the assessment and the decision on the illegality of the specific \ncontent. That assessment should be performed solely with reference to the rules \ngoverning the legality of the content.\n(137) The compliance with the transparency obligations for the AI systems coved by this \nRegulation should not be interpreted as indicating that the use of the system or its output \nis lawful under this Regulation or other Union and Member State law and should be \nwithout prejudice to other transparency obligations for deployers of AI systems laid \ndown in Union or national law.\n(138) AI is a rapidly developing family of technologies that requires regulatory oversight and a \nsafe and controlled space for experimentation, while ensuring responsible innovation and \nintegration of appropriate safeguards and risk mitigation measures. To ensure a legal \nframework that promotes innovation, is future-proof and resilient to disruption, Member \nStates should ensure that their national competent authorities establish at least one AI \nregulatory sandboxes at national level to facilitate the development and testing of \ninnovative AI systems under strict regulatory oversight before these systems are placed on \nthe market or otherwise put into service. Member States could also fulfil this obligation \nthrough participating in already existing regulatory sandboxes or establishing jointly a \nsandbox with one or more Member States\u2019 competent authorities, insofar as this \nparticipation provides equivalent level of national coverage for the participating Member \nStates. Regulatory sandboxes could be established in physical, digital or hybrid form and \nmay accommodate physical as well as digital products. Establishing authorities should \nalso ensure that the regulatory sandboxes have the adequate resources for their \nfunctioning, including financial and human resources.\n(139) The objectives of the AI regulatory sandboxes should be to foster AI innovation by \nestablishing a controlled experimentation and testing environment in the development and \npre-marketing phase with a view to ensuring compliance of the innovative AI systems with \nthis Regulation and other relevant Union and national law, to enhance legal certainty for \ninnovators and the competent authorities\u2019 oversight and understanding of the opportunities, \nemerging risks and the impacts of AI use, to facilitate regulatory learning for authorities \nand undertakings, including with a view to future adaptions of the legal framework, to \nsupport cooperation and the sharing of best practices with the authorities involved in the \nAI regulatory sandbox, and to accelerate access to markets, including by removing \nbarriers for SMEs, including start-ups. Regulatory sandboxes should be widely available \nthroughout the Union, and particular attention should be given to their accessibility for \nSMEs, including start-ups. The participation in the AI regulatory sandbox should focus \non issues that raise legal uncertainty for providers and prospective providers to innovate, \nexperiment with AI in the Union and contribute to evidence-based regulatory learning. \nThe supervision of the AI systems in the AI regulatory sandbox should therefore cover \ntheir development, training, testing and validation before the systems are placed on the \nmarket or put into service, as well as the notion and occurrence of substantial \nmodification that may require a new conformity assessment procedure. Any significant \nrisks identified during the development and testing of such AI systems should result in \nadequate mitigation and, failing that, in the suspension of the development and testing \nprocess. \nWhere appropriate, national competent authorities establishing AI regulatory sandboxes \nshould cooperate with other relevant authorities, including those supervising the \nprotection of fundamental rights,, and could allow for the involvement of other actors \nwithin the AI ecosystem such as national or European standardisation organisations, \nnotified bodies, testing and experimentation facilities, research and experimentation \nlabs, European Digital Innovation Hubs and relevant stakeholder and civil society \norganisations. To ensure uniform implementation across the Union and economies of \nscale, it is appropriate to establish common rules for the regulatory sandboxes\u2019 \nimplementation and a framework for cooperation between the relevant authorities \ninvolved in the supervision of the sandboxes. AI regulatory sandboxes established under \nthis Regulation should be without prejudice to other law allowing for the establishment \nof other sandboxes aiming to ensure compliance with Union law other that this \nRegulation. Where appropriate, relevant competent authorities in charge of those other \nregulatory sandboxes should consider the benefits of using those sandboxes also for the \npurpose of ensuring compliance of AI systems with this Regulation. Upon agreement \nbetween the national competent authorities and the participants in the AI regulatory \nsandbox, testing in real world conditions may also be operated and supervised in the \nframework of the AI regulatory sandbox.\n(140) This Regulation should provide the legal basis for the providers and prospective \nproviders in the AI regulatory sandbox to use personal data collected for other purposes \nfor developing certain AI systems in the public interest within the AI regulatory sandbox, \nonly under specified conditions, in accordance with Article 6(4) and Article 9(2), point \n(g), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and Articles 5, 6 and 10 of Regulation (EU) \n2018/1725, and without prejudice to Article 4(2) and Article 10 of Directive (EU) \n2016/680. All other obligations of data controllers and rights of data subjects under \nRegulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680 remain \napplicable. In particular, this Regulation should not provide a legal basis in the meaning \nof Article 22(2), point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and Article 24(2), point (b) of \nRegulation (EU) 2018/1725. Providers and prospective providers in the sandbox should \nensure appropriate safeguards and cooperate with the competent authorities, including \nby following their guidance and acting expeditiously and in good faith to adequately \nmitigate any identified - significant risks to safety, health, and fundamental rights that \nmay arise during the development, testing and experimentation in the sandbox.\n(141) In order to accelerate the process of development and the placing on the market of the \nhigh-risk AI systems listed in an annex to this Regulation, it is important that providers \nor prospective providers of such systems may also benefit from a specific regime for \ntesting those systems in real world conditions, without participating in an AI regulatory \nsandbox. However, in such cases and taking into account the possible consequences of \nsuch testing on individuals, it should be ensured that appropriate and sufficient \nguarantees and conditions are introduced by this Regulation for providers or prospective \nproviders. Such guarantees should include, among others, requesting informed consent \nof natural persons to participate in testing in real world conditions, with the exception of \nlaw enforcement where the seeking of informed consent would prevent the AI system \nfrom being tested. Consent of subjects to participate in such testing under this \nRegulation is distinct from and without prejudice to consent of data subjects for the \nprocessing of their personal data under the relevant data protection law. \nIt is also important to minimise the risks and enable oversight by competent authorities \nand therefore require prospective providers to have a real-world testing plan submitted to \ncompetent market surveillance authority, register the testing in dedicated sections in the \nEU database subject to some limited exceptions, set limitations on the period for which \nthe testing can be done and require additional safeguards for vulnerable persons, \nincluding groups of vulnerable persons as well as a written agreement defining the roles \nand responsibilities of prospective providers and deployers and effective oversight by \ncompetent personnel involved in the real world testing. Furthermore, it is appropriate to \nenvisage additional safeguards to ensure that the predictions, recommendations or \ndecisions of the AI system can be effectively reversed and disregarded and that personal \ndata is protected and is deleted when the subjects have withdrawn their consent to \nparticipate in the testing without prejudice to their rights as data subjects under the \nUnion data protection law. As regards transfer of data, it is also appropriate to envisage \nthat data collected and processed for the purpose of testing in real-world conditions \nshould be transferred to third countries only where appropriate and applicable \nsafeguards under Union law are implemented, in particular in accordance with bases for \ntransfer of personal data under Union law on data protection, while for non-personal \ndata appropriate safeguards are put in place in accordance with Union law, such as \nRegulations (EU) 2022/86845 and (EU) 2023/285446of the European Parliament and of the \nCouncil.\n45 Regulation (EU) 2022/868 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022 \non European data governance and amending Regulation (EU) 2018/1724 (Data Governance \nAct) (OJ L 152, 3.6.2022, p. 1).\n46 Regulation (EU) 2023/2854 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December \n2023 on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data and amending Regulation (EU) \n2017/2394 and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 (Data Act) (OJ L, 2023/2854, 22.12.2023, ELI: \nhttp://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/2854/oj).\n(142) To ensure that AI leads to socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, Member \nStates are encouraged to support and promote research and development of AI solutions \nin support of socially and environmentally beneficial outcomes, such as AI-based \nsolutions to increase accessibility for persons with disabilities, tackle socio-economic \ninequalities, or meet environmental targets, by allocating sufficient resources, including \npublic and Union funding, and, where appropriate and provided that the eligibility and \nselection criteria are fulfilled, considering in particular projects which pursue such \nobjectives. Such projects should be based on the principle of interdisciplinary \ncooperation between AI developers, experts on inequality and non-discrimination, \naccessibility, consumer, environmental, and digital rights, as well as academics.\n(143) In order to promote and protect innovation, it is important that the interests of SMEs, \nincluding start-ups, that are providers or deployers of AI systems are taken into particular \naccount. To this objective, Member States should develop initiatives, which are targeted at \nthose operators, including on, awareness raising and information communication. Member \nStates shall provide SMEs, including start-ups, having a registered office or a branch in \nthe Union, with priority access to the AI regulatory sandboxes provided that they fulfil \nthe eligibility conditions and selection criteria and without precluding other providers \nand prospective providers to access the sandboxes provided the same conditions and \ncriteria are fulfilled. Member States shall utilise existing channels and where \nappropriate, establish new dedicated channels for communication with SMEs, start-ups, \ndeployers other innovators and, as appropriate, local public authorities, to support SMEs \nthroughout their development path by providing guidance and responding to queries \nabout the implementation of this Regulation. Where appropriate, these channels shall \nwork together to create synergies and ensure homogeneity in their guidance to SMEs, \nincluding start-ups, and deployers. Additionally, Member States should facilitate the \nparticipation of SMEs and other relevant stakeholders in the standardisation \ndevelopment processes. Moreover, the specific interests and needs of SMEs, including \nstart-ups, providers should be taken into account when Notified Bodies set conformity \nassessment fees. The Commission should regularly assess the certification and \ncompliance costs for SMEs, including start-ups, through transparent consultations \ndeployers and should work with Member States to lower such costs. \nFor example, translation costs related to mandatory documentation and communication \nwith authorities may constitute a significant cost for providers and other operators, in \nparticular those of a smaller scale. Member States should possibly ensure that one of the \nlanguages determined and accepted by them for relevant providers\u2019 documentation and for \ncommunication with operators is one which is broadly understood by the largest possible \nnumber of cross-border deployers. In order to address the specific needs of SMEs, \nincluding start-ups, the Commission should provide standardised templates for the areas \ncovered by this Regulation upon request of the Board. Additionally, the Commission \nshould complement Member States\u2019 efforts by providing a single information platform \nwith easy-to-use information with regards to this Regulation for all providers and \ndeployers, by organising appropriate communication campaigns to raise awareness \nabout the obligations arising from this Regulation, and by evaluating and promoting the \nconvergence of best practices in public procurement procedures in relation to AI \nsystems. Medium-sized enterprises which were recently small enterprises within the \nmeaning of the Annex to Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC47 should have \naccess to those support measures, as those new medium-sized enterprises may sometimes \nlack the legal resources and training necessary to ensure proper understanding of, and \ncompliance with, this Regulation.\n47 Commission Recommendation of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises (OJ L 124, 20.5.2003, p. 36).\n(144) In order to promote and protect innovation, the AI-on-demand platform, all relevant \nUnion funding programmes and projects, such as Digital Europe Programme, Horizon \nEurope, implemented by the Commission and the Member States at Union or national \nlevel should, as appropriate, contribute to the achievement of the objectives of this \nRegulation.\n(145)In particular, in order to minimise the risks to implementation resulting from lack of \nknowledge and expertise in the market as well as to facilitate compliance of providers, in \nparticular SMEs, including start-ups, and notified bodies with their obligations under this \nRegulation, the AI-on-demand platform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the \ntesting and experimentation facilities established by the Commission and the Member \nStates at Union or national level should contribute to the implementation of this \nRegulation. Within their respective mission and fields of competence, the AI-on-demand \nplatform, the European Digital Innovation Hubs and the testing and experimentation \nFacilities are able to provide in particular technical and scientific support to providers and \nnotified bodies.\n(146) Moreover, in light of the very small size of some operators and in order to ensure \nproportionality regarding costs of innovation, it is appropriate to allow microenterprises \nto fulfil one of the most costly obligations, namely to establish a quality management \nsystem, in a simplified manner which would reduce the administrative burden and the \ncosts for those enterprises without affecting the level of protection and the need for \ncompliance with the requirements for high-risk AI systems. The Commission should \ndevelop guidelines to specify the elements of the quality management system to be \nfulfilled in this simplified manner by microentreprises.\n(147) It is appropriate that the Commission facilitates, to the extent possible, access to testing \nand experimentation facilities to bodies, groups or laboratories established or accredited \npursuant to any relevant Union harmonisation legislation and which fulfil tasks in the \ncontext of conformity assessment of products or devices covered by that Union \nharmonisation legislation. This is, in particular, the case as regards expert panels, expert \nlaboratories and reference laboratories in the field of medical devices pursuant to \nRegulations (EU) 2017/745 and (EU) 2017/746.\n(148) This Regulation should establish a governance framework that both allows to coordinate \nand support the application of this Regulation at national level, as well as build \ncapabilities at Union level and integrate stakeholders in the field of AI. The effective \nimplementation and enforcement of this Regulation require a governance framework \nthat allows to coordinate and build up central expertise at Union level. The AI Office \nwas established by Commission Decision48 and has as its mission to develop Union \nexpertise and capabilities in the field of AI and to contribute to the implementation of \nUnion law on AI. Member States should facilitate the tasks of the AI Office with a view \nto support the development of Union expertise and capabilities at Union level and to \nstrengthen the functioning of the digital single market. Furthermore, a Board composed \nof representatives of the Member States, a scientific panel to integrate the scientific \ncommunity and an advisory forum to contribute stakeholder input to the implementation \nof this Regulation, at Union and national level, should be established. The development \nof Union expertise and capabilities should also include making use of existing resources \nand expertise, in particular through synergies with structures built up in the context of \nthe Union level enforcement of other law and synergies with related initiatives at Union \nlevel, such as the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking and the AI testing and experimentation \nfacilities under the Digital Europe Programme.\n48 Commission Decision of 24.1.2024 establishing the European Artificial Intelligence Office \nC(2024) 390.\n(149) In order to facilitate a smooth, effective and harmonised implementation of this Regulation \na Board should be established. The Board should reflect the various interests of the AI \neco-system and be composed of representatives of the Member States. The Board should \nbe responsible for a number of advisory tasks, including issuing opinions, \nrecommendations, advice or contributing to guidance on matters related to the \nimplementation of this Regulation, including on enforcement matters, technical \nspecifications or existing standards regarding the requirements established in this \nRegulation and providing advice to the Commission and the Member States and their \nnational competent authorities on specific questions related to AI. In order to give some \nflexibility to Member States in the designation of their representatives in the Board, such \nrepresentatives may be any persons belonging to public entities who should have the \nrelevant competences and powers to facilitate coordination at national level and \ncontribute to the achievement of the Board's tasks. The Board should establish two \nstanding sub-groups to provide a platform for cooperation and exchange among market \nsurveillance authorities and notifying authorities on issues related, respectively, to \nmarket surveillance and notified bodies. The standing subgroup for market surveillance \nshould act as the administrative cooperation group (ADCO) for this Regulation within \nthe meaning of Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. In accordance with Article 33 \nof that Regulation, the Commission should support the activities of the standing \nsubgroup for market surveillance by undertaking market evaluations or studies, in \nparticular with a view to identifying aspects of this Regulation requiring specific and \nurgent coordination among market surveillance authorities. The Board may establish \nother standing or temporary sub-groups as appropriate for the purpose of examining \nspecific issues. The Board should also cooperate, as appropriate, with relevant Union \nbodies, experts groups and networks active in the context of relevant Union law, \nincluding in particular those active under relevant Union law on data, digital products \nand services.\n(150) With a view to ensure the involvement of stakeholders in the implementation and \napplication of this Regulation, an advisory forum should be established to advise and \nprovide technical expertise to the Board and the Commission. To ensure a varied and \nbalanced stakeholder representation between commercial and non-commercial interest \nand, within the category of commercial interests, with regards to SMEs and other \nundertakings, the advisory forum should comprise inter alia industry, start-ups, SMEs, \nacademia, civil society, including the social partners, as well as the Fundamental Rights \nAgency, ENISA, the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), the European \nCommittee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European \nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).\n(151) To support the implementation and enforcement of this Regulation, in particular the \nmonitoring activities of the AI Office as regards general-purpose AI models, a scientific \npanel of independent experts should be established. The independent experts \nconstituting the scientific panel should be selected on the basis of up-to-date scientific or \ntechnical expertise in the field of AI and should perform their tasks with impartiality, \nobjectivity and ensure the confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying \nout their tasks and activities. To allow reinforcing national capacities necessary for the \neffective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should be able to request \nsupport from the pool of experts constituting the scientific panel for their enforcement \nactivities.\n(152) In order to support adequate enforcement as regards AI systems and reinforce the \ncapacities of the Member States, Union AI testing support structures should be \nestablished and made available to the Member States.\n(153) Member States hold a key role in the application and enforcement of this Regulation. In \nthat respect, each Member State should designate at least one notifying authority and at \nleast one market surveillance authority as national competent authorities for the purpose \nof supervising the application and implementation of this Regulation. Member States may \ndecide to appoint any kind of public entity to perform the tasks of the national competent \nauthorities within the meaning of this Regulation, in accordance with their specific \nnational organisational characteristics and needs. In order to increase organisation \nefficiency on the side of Member States and to set a single point of contact vis-\u00e0-vis the \npublic and other counterparts at Member State and Union levels, \u258c each Member State \nshould designate a market surveillance authority to act as a single point of contact.\n(154) The national competent authorities should exercise their powers independently, \nimpartially and without bias, so as to safeguard the principles of objectivity of their \nactivities and tasks and to ensure the application and implementation of this Regulation. \nThe members of these authorities should refrain from any action incompatible with their \nduties and should be subject to confidentiality rules under this Regulation.\n(155) In order to ensure that providers of high-risk AI systems can take into account the \nexperience on the use of high-risk AI systems for improving their systems and the design \nand development process or can take any possible corrective action in a timely manner, all \nproviders should have a post-market monitoring system in place. Where relevant, post-\nmarket monitoring should include an analysis of the interaction with other AI systems \nincluding other devices and software. Post-market monitoring should not cover sensitive \noperational data of deployers which are law enforcement authorities. This system is also \nkey to ensure that the possible risks emerging from AI systems which continue to \u2018learn\u2019 \nafter being placed on the market or put into service can be more efficiently and timely \naddressed. In this context, providers should also be required to have a system in place to \nreport to the relevant authorities any serious incidents resulting from the use of their AI \nsystems, meaning incident or malfunctioning leading to death or serious damage to \nhealth, serious and irreversible disruption of the management and operation of critical \ninfrastructure, infringements of obligations under Union law intended to protect \nfundamental rights or serious damage to property or the environment.\n(156) In order to ensure an appropriate and effective enforcement of the requirements and \nobligations set out by this Regulation, which is Union harmonisation legislation, the \nsystem of market surveillance and compliance of products established by Regulation (EU) \n2019/1020 should apply in its entirety. Market surveillance authorities designated \npursuant to this Regulation should have all enforcement powers laid down in this \nRegulation and in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 and should exercise their powers and \ncarry out their duties independently, impartially and without bias. Although the majority \nof AI systems are not subject to specific requirements and obligations under this \nRegulation, market surveillance authorities may take measures in relation to all AI \nsystems when they present a risk in accordance with this Regulation. Due to the specific \nnature of Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this \nRegulation, it is appropriate to designate the European Data Protection Supervisor as a \ncompetent market surveillance authority for them. This should be without prejudice to \nthe designation of national competent authorities by the Member States. Market \nsurveillance activities should not affect the ability of the supervised entities to carry out \ntheir tasks independently, when such independence is required by Union law.\n(157) This Regulation is without prejudice to the competences, tasks, powers and \nindependence of relevant national public authorities or bodies which supervise the \napplication of Union law protecting fundamental rights, including equality bodies and \ndata protection authorities. Where necessary for their mandate, those national public \nauthorities or bodies should also have access to any documentation created under this \nRegulation. A specific safeguard procedure should be set for ensuring adequate and \ntimely enforcement against AI systems presenting a risk to health, safety and \nfundamental rights. The procedure for such AI systems presenting a risk should be \napplied to high-risk AI systems presenting a risk, prohibited systems which have been \nplaced on the market, put into service or used in violation of the prohibited practices laid \ndown in this Regulation and AI systems which have been made available in violation of \nthe transparency requirements laid down in this Regulation and present a risk.\n(158) Union financial services law includes internal governance and risk-management rules and \nrequirements which are applicable to regulated financial institutions in the course of \nprovision of those services, including when they make use of AI systems. In order to \nensure coherent application and enforcement of the obligations under this Regulation and \nrelevant rules and requirements of the Union financial services legal acts, the competent \nauthorities for the supervision and enforcement of those legal acts, in particular competent \nauthorities as defined in Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and \nof the Council49 and Directives 2008/48/EC50, 2009/138/EC51, 2013/36/EU52, \n2014/17/EU53 and (EU) 2016/9754of the European Parliament and of the Council, should \nbe designated, within their respective competences, as competent authorities for the \npurpose of supervising the implementation of this Regulation, including for market \nsurveillance activities, as regards AI systems provided or used by regulated and supervised \nfinancial institutions unless Member States decide to designate another authority to fulfil \nthese market surveillance tasks. \n49Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June \n2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending \nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1).\n50Directive 2008/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 on \ncredit agreements for consumers and repealing Council Directive 87/102/EEC (OJ L 133, \n22.5.2008, p. 66).\n51Directive 2009/138/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November \n2009 on the taking-up and pursuit of the business of Insurance and Reinsurance (Solvency \nII) (OJ L 335, 17.12.2009, p. 1).\n52Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on \naccess to the activity of credit institutions and the prudential supervision of credit \ninstitutions and investment firms, amending Directive 2002/87/EC and repealing Directives \n2006/48/EC and 2006/49/EC (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 338).\n53Directive 2014/17/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 February 2014 on \ncredit agreements for consumers relating to residential immovable property and amending \nDirectives 2008/48/EC and 2013/36/EU and Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (OJ L 60, \n28.2.2014, p. 34).\n54Directive (EU) 2016/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 January 2016 \non insurance distribution (OJ L 26, 2.2.2016, p. 19).\nThose competent authorities should have all powers under this Regulation and \nRegulation (EU) 2019/1020 to enforce the requirements and obligations of this \nRegulation, including powers to carry our ex post market surveillance activities that can \nbe integrated, as appropriate, into their existing supervisory mechanisms and procedures \nunder the relevant Union financial services law. It is appropriate to envisage that, when \nacting as market surveillance authorities under this Regulation, the national authorities \nresponsible for the supervision of credit institutions regulated under Directive \n2013/36/EU, which are participating in the Single Supervisory Mechanism established \nby Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/201355, should report, without delay, to the \nEuropean Central Bank any information identified in the course of their market \nsurveillance activities that may be of potential interest for the European Central Bank\u2019s \nprudential supervisory tasks as specified in that Regulation. \n55Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013 of 15 October 2013 conferring specific tasks on the \nEuropean Central Bank concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit \ninstitutions (OJ L 287, 29.10.2013, p. 63).\nTo further enhance the consistency between this Regulation and the rules applicable to \ncredit institutions regulated under Directive 2013/36/EU, it is also appropriate to integrate \n\u258c some of the providers\u2019 procedural obligations in relation to risk management, post \nmarketing monitoring and documentation into the existing obligations and procedures \nunder Directive 2013/36/EU. In order to avoid overlaps, limited derogations should also be \nenvisaged in relation to the quality management system of providers and the monitoring \nobligation placed on deployers of high-risk AI systems to the extent that these apply to \ncredit institutions regulated by Directive 2013/36/EU. The same regime should apply to \ninsurance and re-insurance undertakings and insurance holding companies under \nDirective 2009/138/EC and the insurance intermediaries under Directive (EU) 2016/97 \nand other types of financial institutions subject to requirements regarding internal \ngovernance, arrangements or processes established pursuant to the relevant Union \nfinancial services law to ensure consistency and equal treatment in the financial sector.\n(159) Each market surveillance authority for high-risk AI systems in the area of biometrics, as \nlisted in an annex to this Regulation insofar as those systems are used for the purposes \nof law enforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, or the \nadministration of justice and democratic processes, should have effective investigative \nand corrective powers, including at least the power to obtain access to all personal data \nthat are being processed and to all information necessary for the performance of its \ntasks. The market surveillance authorities should be able to exercise their powers by \nacting with complete independence. Any limitations of their access to sensitive \noperational data under this Regulation should be without prejudice to the powers \nconferred to them by Directive (EU) 2016/680. No exclusion on disclosing data to \nnational data protection authorities under this Regulation should affect the current or \nfuture powers of those authorities beyond the scope of this Regulation.\n(160) The market surveillance authorities of the Member States and the Commission should be \nable to propose joint activities, including joint investigations, to be conducted by market \nsurveillance authorities or market surveillance authorities jointly with the Commission, \nthat have the aim of promoting compliance, identifying non-compliance, raising \nawareness and providing guidance in relation to this Regulation with respect to specific \ncategories of high-risk AI systems that are found to present a serious risk across two or \nmore Member States. Joint activities to promote compliance should be carried out in \naccordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. The AI Office should provide \ncoordination support for joint investigations.\n(161) It is necessary to clarify the responsibilities and competences at Union and national level \nas regards AI systems that are built on general-purpose AI models. To avoid overlapping \ncompetences, where an AI system is based on a general-purpose AI model and the model \nand system are provided by the same provider, the supervision should take place at \nUnion level through the AI Office, which should have the powers of a market \nsurveillance authority within the meaning of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 for this \npurpose. In all other cases, national market surveillance authorities remain responsible \nfor the supervision of AI systems. However, for general-purpose AI systems that can be \nused directly by deployers for at least one purpose that is classified as high-risk, market \nsurveillance authorities should cooperate with the AI Office to carry out evaluations of \ncompliance and inform the Board and other market surveillance authorities accordingly. \nFurthermore, market surveillance authorities should be able to request assistance from \nthe AI Office where the market surveillance authority is unable to conclude an \ninvestigation on a high-risk AI system because of its inability to access certain \ninformation related to the general-purpose AI model on which the high-risk AI system is \nbuilt. In such cases, the procedure regarding mutual assistance in cross-border cases in \nChapter VI of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 should apply mutatis mutandis.\n(162) To make best use of the centralised Union expertise and synergies at Union level, the \npowers of supervision and enforcement of the obligations on providers of general-\npurpose AI models should be a competence of the Commission. The Commission should \nentrust the implementation of these tasks to the AI Office, without prejudice to the \npowers of organisation of the Commission and the division of competences between \nMember States and the Union based on the Treaties. The AI Office should be able to \ncarry out all necessary actions to monitor the effective implementation of this Regulation \nas regards general-purpose AI models. It should be able to investigate possible \ninfringements of the rules on providers of general-purpose AI models both on its own \ninitiative, following the results of its monitoring activities, or upon request from market \nsurveillance authorities in line with the conditions set out in this Regulation. To support \neffective monitoring of the AI Office, it should provide for the possibility that \ndownstream providers lodge complaints about possible infringements of the rules on \nproviders of general-purpose AI systems.\n(163) With a view to complement the governance systems for general-purpose AI models, the \nscientific panel should support the monitoring activities of the AI Office and may, in \ncertain cases, provide qualified alerts to the AI Office which trigger follow-ups such as \ninvestigations. This should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect \nthat a general-purpose AI model poses a concrete and identifiable risk at Union level. \nFurthermore, this should be the case where the scientific panel has reason to suspect \nthat a general-purpose AI model meets the criteria that would lead to a classification as \ngeneral-purpose AI model with systemic risk. To equip the scientific panel with the \ninformation necessary for the performance of those tasks, there should be a mechanism \nwhereby the scientific panel can request the Commission to require documentation or \ninformation from a provider.\n(164) The AI Office should be able to take the necessary actions to monitor the effective \nimplementation of and compliance with the obligations for providers of general-purpose \nAI models laid down in this Regulation. The AI Office should be able to investigate \npossible infringements in accordance with the powers provided for in this Regulation, \nincluding by requesting documentation and information, by conducting evaluations, as \nwell as by requesting measures from providers of general-purpose AI models. In the \nconduct of evaluations, in order to make use of independent expertise, the AI Office \nshould be able to involve independent experts to carry out the evaluations on its behalf. \nCompliance with the obligations should be enforceable, inter alia, through requests to \ntake appropriate measures, including risk mitigation measures in the case of identified \nsystemic risks as well as restricting the making available on the market, withdrawing or \nrecalling the model. As a safeguard, where needed beyond the procedural rights \nprovided for in this Regulation, providers of general-purpose AI models should have the \nprocedural rights provided for in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, which should \napply mutatis mutandis, without prejudice to more specific procedural rights provided \nfor by this Regulation.\n(165) The development of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems in accordance with the \nrequirements of this Regulation may lead to a larger uptake of ethical and trustworthy AI \nin the Union. Providers of AI systems that are not high-risk should be encouraged to create \ncodes of conduct, including related governance mechanisms, intended to foster the \nvoluntary application of some or all of the mandatory requirements applicable to high-risk \nAI systems, adapted in light of the intended purpose of the systems and the lower risk \ninvolved and taking into account the available technical solutions and industry best \npractices such as model and data cards. Providers and, as appropriate, deployers of all \nAI systems, high-risk or not, and AI models should also be encouraged to apply on a \nvoluntary basis additional requirements related, for example, to the elements of the \nUnion\u2019s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, environmental sustainability, AI literacy \nmeasures, inclusive and diverse design and development of AI systems, including \nattention to vulnerable persons and accessibility to persons with disability, stakeholders\u2019 \nparticipation with the involvement, as appropriate, of relevant stakeholders such as \nbusiness and civil society organisations, academia, research organisations, trade unions \nand consumer protection organisation in the design and development of AI systems, and \ndiversity of the development teams, including gender balance. To ensure that the \nvoluntary codes of conduct are effective, they should be based on clear objectives and \nkey performance indicators to measure the achievement of those objectives. They should \nalso be developed in an inclusive way, as appropriate, with the involvement of relevant \nstakeholders such as business and civil society organisations, academia, research \norganisations, trade unions and consumer protection organisation. The Commission \nmay develop initiatives, including of a sectorial nature, to facilitate the lowering of \ntechnical barriers hindering cross-border exchange of data for AI development, including \non data access infrastructure, semantic and technical interoperability of different types of \ndata.\n(166) It is important that AI systems related to products that are not high-risk in accordance with \nthis Regulation and thus are not required to comply with the requirements set out for high-\nrisk AI systems are nevertheless safe when placed on the market or put into service. To \ncontribute to this objective, Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council56 would apply as a safety net.\n(167) In order to ensure trustful and constructive cooperation of competent authorities on Union \nand national level, all parties involved in the application of this Regulation should respect \nthe confidentiality of information and data obtained in carrying out their tasks, in \naccordance with Union or national law. They should carry out their tasks and activities \nin such a manner as to protect, in particular, intellectual property rights, confidential \nbusiness information and trade secrets, the effective implementation of this Regulation, \npublic and national security interests, the integrity of criminal and administrative \nproceedings, and the integrity of classified information.\n56Regulation (EU) 2023/988 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 2023 \non general product safety, amending Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 of the European \nParliament and of the Council and Directive (EU) 2020/1828 of the European Parliament \nand the Council, and repealing Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of \nthe Council and Council Directive 87/357/EEC (OJ L 135, 23.5.2023, p. 1).\n(168)Compliance with this Regulation should be enforceable by means of the imposition of \npenalties and other enforcement measures. Member States should take all necessary \nmeasures to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are implemented, including by \nlaying down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for their infringement, \nincluding in respect of the ne bis in idem principle. In order to strengthen and \nharmonise administrative penalties for infringement of this Regulation, the upper limits \nfor setting the administrative fines for certain specific infringements should be laid down. \nWhen assessing the amount of the fines, Member States should, in each individual case, \ntake into account all relevant circumstances of the specific situation, with due regard in \nparticular to the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement and of its \nconsequences and to the size of the provider, in particular if the provider is an SME, \nincluding a start-up. The European Data Protection Supervisor should have the power to \nimpose fines on Union institutions, agencies and bodies falling within the scope of this \nRegulation.\n(169) Compliance with the obligations on providers of general-purpose AI models imposed \nunder this Regulation should be enforceable among others by means of fines. To that \nend, appropriate levels of fines should also be laid down for infringement of those \nobligations, including the failure to comply with measures requested by the Commission \nin accordance with this Regulation, subject to appropriate limitation periods in \naccordance with the principle of proportionality. All decisions taken by the Commission \nunder this Regulation are subject to review by the Court of Justice of the European \nUnion in accordance with the TFEU.\n(170) Union and national law already provide effective remedies to natural and legal persons \nwhose rights and freedoms are adversely affected by the use of AI systems. Without \nprejudice to those remedies, any natural or legal person that has grounds to consider \nthat there has been an infringement of this Regulation should be entitled to lodge a \ncomplaint to the relevant market surveillance authority.\n(171) Affected persons should have the right to obtain an explanation where a deployer\u2019s \ndecision is based mainly upon the output from certain high-risk systems that fall within \nthe scope of this Regulation and where that decision produces legal effects or similarly \nsignificantly affects those persons in a way that they consider to have an adverse impact \non their health, safety or fundamental rights. That explanation should be clear and \nmeaningful and should provide a basis on which the affected persons are able to \nexercise their rights. The right to obtain an explanation should not apply to the use of AI \nsystems for which exceptions or restrictions follow from Union or national law and \nshould apply only to the extent this right is not already provided for under Union law.\n(172) Persons acting as whistleblowers on the infringements of this Regulation should be \nprotected under the Union law. Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament \nand of the Council57 should therefore apply to the reporting of infringements of this \nRegulation and the protection of persons reporting such infringements.\n57Directive (EU) 2019/1937 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October \n2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law (OJ L 305, 26.11.2019, \np. 17).\n(173) In order to ensure that the regulatory framework can be adapted where necessary, the \npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the \nCommission to amend the conditions under which an AI system shall not be considered as \nhigh-risk, the list of high-risk AI systems, the provisions regarding technical \ndocumentation, the content of the EU declaration of conformity the provisions regarding \nthe conformity assessment procedures, the provisions establishing the high-risk AI systems \nto which the conformity assessment procedure based on assessment of the quality \nmanagement system and assessment of the technical documentation should apply, the \nthreshold, benchmarks and indicators, including by supplementing those benchmarks \nand indicators, in the rules for the classification of general-purpose AI models with \nsystemic risk, the criteria for the designation of general-purpose AI models with systemic \nrisk, the technical documentation for providers of general-purpose AI models and the \ntransparency information for providers of general-purpose AI models. It is of particular \nimportance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory \nwork, including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance \nwith the principles laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on \nBetter Law-Making58. In particular, to ensure equal participation in the preparation of \ndelegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents at the same \ntime as Member States\u2019 experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings \nof Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.\n58OJ L 123, 12.5.2016, p. 1.\n(174) Given the rapid technological developments and the required technical expertise in the \neffective application of this Regulation, the Commission should evaluate and review this \nRegulation by ... [five years from the date of entry into force of this Regulation] and \nevery four years thereafter and report to the European Parliament and the Council. In \naddition, taking into account the implications for the scope of this Regulation, the \nCommission should carry out an assessment of the need to amend the list of high-risk AI \nsystems and the list of prohibited practices once a year. Moreover, by two years after \nentry into application and every four years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate \nand report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the need to amend the list \nof high-risk areas in the annex to this Regulation, the AI systems within the scope of the \ntransparency obligations, the effectiveness of the supervision and governance system \nand the progress on the development of standardisation deliverables on energy efficient \ndevelopment of general-purpose AI models, including the need for further measures or \nactions. Finally, by ... [four years from the entry into force of this Regulation] and every \nthree years thereafter, the Commission should evaluate the impact and effectiveness of \nvoluntary codes of conduct to foster the application of the requirements provided for \nhigh-risk AI systems in the case of AI systems other than high-risk AI systems and \npossibly other additional requirements for such AI systems.\n(175) In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, \nimplementing powers should be conferred on the Commission. Those powers should be \nexercised in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament \nand of the Council59.\n(176) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to improve the functioning of the internal \nmarket and promoting the uptake of human centric and trustworthy AI, while ensuring a \nhigh level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the Charter, \nincluding democracy, the rule of law and environmental protection against harmful effects \nof AI systems in the Union and supporting innovation, cannot be sufficiently achieved by \nthe Member States and can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better \nachieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of \nsubsidiarity as set out in Article 5 TEU. In accordance with the principle of proportionality \nas set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to \nachieve that objective.\n59Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 \nFebruary 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for \ncontrol by Member States of the Commission\u2019s exercise of implementing powers (OJ L 55, \n28.2.2011, p. 13).\n(177) In order to ensure legal certainty, ensure an appropriate adaptation period for operators \nand avoid disruption to the market, including by ensuring continuity of the use of AI \nsystems, it is appropriate that this Regulation applies to the high-risk AI systems that \nhave been placed on the market or put into service before the general date of application \nthereof, only if, from that date, those systems are subject to significant changes in their \ndesign or intended purpose. It is appropriate to clarify that, in this respect, the concept of \nsignificant change should be understood as equivalent in substance to the notion of \nsubstantial modification, which is used with regard only to high-risk AI systems \npursuant to this Regulation. On an exceptional basis and in light of public \naccountability, operators of AI systems which are components of the large-scale IT \nsystems established by the legal acts listed in an annex to this Regulation and operators \nof high-risk AI systems that are intended to be used by public authorities should, \nrespectively, take the necessary steps to comply with the requirements of this Regulation \nby end of 2030 and by six years after the entry into force.\n(178) Providers of high-risk AI systems are encouraged to start to comply, on a voluntary \nbasis, with the relevant obligations of this Regulation already during the transitional \nperiod.\n(179) This Regulation should apply from \u2026 [two years from the date of entry into force of this \nRegulation]. However, taking into account the unacceptable risk associated with the use \nof AI in certain ways, the prohibitions should apply already from \u2026 [six months from \nthe date of entry into force of this Regulation]. While the full effect of those prohibitions \nfollows with the establishment of the governance and enforcement of this Regulation, \nanticipating the application of the prohibitions is important to take account of \nunacceptable risks and to have an effect on other procedures, such as in civil law. \nMoreover, the infrastructure related to the governance and the conformity assessment \nsystem should be operational before that date, therefore the provisions on notified bodies \nand governance structure should apply from \u2026 [ 12 months from the date of entry into \nforce of this Regulation]. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements and \nadoption of general-purpose AI models, obligations for providers of general-purpose AI \nmodels should apply from ... [12 months from the date of entry into force of this \nRegulation]. Codes of practice should be ready by... [9 months from the date of entry \ninto force of this Regulation] in view of enabling providers to demonstrate compliance on \ntime. The AI Office should ensure that classification rules and procedures are up to date \nin light of technological developments. In addition, Member States should lay down and \nnotify to the Commission the rules on penalties, including administrative fines, and ensure \nthat they are properly and effectively implemented by the date of application of this \nRegulation. Therefore the provisions on penalties should apply from \u2026 [12 months from \nthe date of entry into force of this Regulation].\n(180) The European Data Protection Supervisor and the European Data Protection Board were \nconsulted in accordance with Article 42(1) and (2) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 and \ndelivered their joint opinion on \u258c 18 June 2021,\nHAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:\nCHAPTER I\nGENERAL PROVISIONS\nArticle 1\nSubject matter`\n1. The purpose of this Regulation is to improve the functioning of the internal market and \npromote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI), while \nensuring a high level of protection of health, safety, fundamental rights enshrined in the \nCharter of Fundamental Rights, including democracy, the rule of law and \nenvironmental protection, against the harmful effects of artificial intelligence systems \n(AI systems) in the Union, and to support innovation.\n2. This Regulation lays down:\n(a) harmonised rules for the placing on the market, the putting into service, and the use \nof AI systems in the Union;\n(b) prohibitions of certain AI practices;\n(c) specific requirements for high-risk AI systems and obligations for operators of such \nsystems;\n(d) harmonised transparency rules for certain AI systems;\n(e) harmonised rules for the placing on the market of general-purpose AI models;\n(f) rules on market monitoring, market surveillance governance and enforcement;\n(g) measures to support innovation, with a particular focus on SMEs, including start-\nups.\nArticle 2\nScope\n1. This Regulation applies to:\n(a) providers placing on the market or putting into service AI systems or placing on the \nmarket general-purpose AI models in the Union, irrespective of whether those \nproviders are established or located within the Union or in a third country;\n(b)deployers of AI systems that have their place of establishment or are located within \nthe Union;\n(c) providers and deployers of AI systems that have their place of establishment or are \nlocated in a third country, where the output produced by the AI system is used in the \nUnion;\n(d) importers and distributors of AI systems;\n(e) product manufacturers placing on the market or putting into service an AI system \ntogether with their product and under their own name or trademark;\n(f) authorised representatives of providers, which are not established in the Union;\n(g) affected persons that are located in the Union.\n2. For \u258c AI systems classified as high-risk AI systems in accordance with Article 6(1) and \n(2) related to products covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in section B \nof Annex I, only Article 112 applies. Article 57 applies only in so far as the requirements \nfor high-risk AI systems under this Regulation have been integrated in that Union \nharmonisation legislation.\n\u258c \n3.This Regulation does not apply to areas outside the scope of Union law, and shall not, in \nany event, affect the competences of the Member States concerning national security, \nregardless of the type of entity entrusted by the Member States with carrying out tasks in \nrelation to those competences.\nThis Regulation does not apply to AI systems where and in so far they are placed on the \nmarket, put into service, or used with or without modification exclusively for military, \ndefence or national security purposes, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those \nactivities.\nThis Regulation does not apply to AI systems which are not placed on the market or put \ninto service in the Union, where the output is used in the Union exclusively for military, \ndefence or national security purposes, regardless of the type of entity carrying out those \nactivities.\n4. This Regulation applies neither to public authorities in a third country nor to international \norganisations falling within the scope of this Regulation pursuant to paragraph 1, where \nthose authorities or organisations use AI systems in the framework of international \ncooperation or agreements for law enforcement and judicial cooperation with the Union or \nwith one or more Member States, provided that such a third country or international \norganisation provides adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of fundamental \nrights and freedoms of individuals.\n5. This Regulation shall not affect the application of the provisions on the liability of \nproviders of intermediary services as set out in Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/2065.\n6. This Regulation does not apply to AI systems or AI models, including their output, \nspecifically developed and put into service for the sole purpose of scientific research and \ndevelopment.\n7. Union law on the protection of personal data, privacy and the confidentiality of \ncommunications applies to personal data processed in connection with the rights and \nobligations laid down in this Regulation. This Regulation shall not affect Regulation \n(EU) 2016/679 or (EU) 2018/1725, or Directive 2002/58/EC or (EU) 2016/680, without \nprejudice to the arrangements provided for in Article 10(5) and Article 59 of this \nRegulation.\n8. This Regulation does not apply to any research, testing or development activity \nregarding AI systems or models prior to their being placed on the market or put into \nservice. Such activities shall be conducted in accordance with applicable Union law. \nTesting in real world conditions shall not be covered by that exclusion.\n9. This Regulation is without prejudice to the rules laid down by other Union legal acts \nrelated to consumer protection and product safety.\n10. This Regulation does not apply to obligations of deployers who are natural persons \nusing AI systems in the course of a purely personal non-professional activity.\n11. This Regulation does not preclude the Union or Member States from maintaining or \nintroducing laws, regulations or administrative provisions which are more favourable to \nworkers in terms of protecting their rights in respect of the use of AI systems by \nemployers, or from encouraging or allowing the application of collective agreements \nwhich are more favourable to workers.\n12. This Regulation applies to AI systems released under free and open source licences, \nunless they are placed on the market or put into service as high-risk AI systems or as an \nAI system that falls under Article 5 or 50.\nArticle 3\nDefinitions\nFor the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:\n(1) \u2018AI system\u2019 means a machine-based system designed to operate with varying levels of \nautonomy, that may exhibit adaptiveness after deployment and that, for explicit or \nimplicit objectives, infers, from the input it receives, how to generate outputs such as \npredictions, content, recommendations, or decisions that can influence physical or virtual \nenvironments;\n(2) \u2018risk\u2019 means the combination of the probability of an occurrence of harm and

In ensuring the compliance of high-risk AI systems referred to in paragraph \n1 with the requirements set out in this Section, and in order to ensure consistency, avoid \nduplications and minimise additional burdens, providers shall have a choice of \nintegrating, as appropriate, the necessary testing and reporting processes, information \nand documentation they provide with regard to their product into documentation and \nprocedures that already exist and are required under the Union harmonisation \nlegislation listed in Section A of Annex I,.\nArticle 9\nRisk management system\n1. A risk management system shall be established, implemented, documented and maintained \nin relation to high-risk AI systems.\n2. The risk management system shall be understood as a continuous iterative process \nplanned and run throughout the entire lifecycle of a high-risk AI system, requiring regular \nsystematic review and updating. It shall comprise the following steps:\n(a) the identification and analysis of the known and the reasonably foreseeable risks \nthat the high-risk AI system can pose to health, safety or fundamental rights when \nthe high-risk AI system is used in accordance with its intended purpose;\n(b) the estimation and evaluation of the risks that may emerge when the high-risk AI \nsystem is used in accordance with its intended purpose, and under conditions of \nreasonably foreseeable misuse;\n(c) the evaluation of other risks possibly arising, based on the analysis of data gathered \nfrom the post-market monitoring system referred to in Article 72;\n(d) the adoption of appropriate and targeted risk management measures designed to \naddress the risks identified pursuant to point (a) .\n3. The risks referred to in this Article shall concern only those which may be reasonably \nmitigated or eliminated through the development or design of the high-risk AI system, or \nthe provision of adequate technical information.\n4. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall give due \nconsideration to the effects and possible interaction resulting from the combined \napplication of the requirements set out in this Section, with a view to minimising risks \nmore effectively while achieving an appropriate balance in implementing the measures \nto fulfil those requirements.\n5. The risk management measures referred to in paragraph 2, point (d), shall be such that the \nrelevant residual risk associated with each hazard, as well as the overall residual risk of the \nhigh-risk AI systems is judged to be acceptable.\nIn identifying the most appropriate risk management measures, the following shall be \nensured:\n(a) elimination or reduction of identified and evaluated risks pursuant to paragraph 2 \nas far as technically feasible through adequate design and development of the high-\nrisk AI system;\n(b) where appropriate, implementation of adequate mitigation and control measures \naddressing risks that cannot be eliminated;\n(c) provision of information required pursuant to Article 13 and, where appropriate, \ntraining to deployers. \u258c\nWith a view to eliminating or reducing risks related to the use of the high-risk AI system, \ndue consideration shall be given to the technical knowledge, experience, education, the \ntraining to be expected by the deployer, and the presumable context in which the system is \nintended to be used.\n6. High-risk AI systems shall be tested for the purpose of identifying the most appropriate \nand targeted risk management measures. Testing shall ensure that high-risk AI systems \nperform consistently for their intended purpose and that they are in compliance with the \nrequirements set out in this Section.\n7. Testing procedures may include testing in real-world conditions in accordance with \nArticle 60.\n8. The testing of high-risk AI systems shall be performed, as appropriate, at any time \nthroughout the development process, and, in any event, prior to their being placed on the \nmarket or put into service. Testing shall be carried out against prior defined metrics and \nprobabilistic thresholds that are appropriate to the intended purpose of the high-risk AI \nsystem.\n9. When implementing the risk management system as provided for in paragraphs 1 to 7, \nproviders shall give consideration to whether in view of its intended purpose the high-risk \nAI system is likely to have an adverse impact on persons under the age of 18 and, as \nappropriate, other groups of vulnerable persons.\n10. For providers of high-risk AI systems that are subject to requirements regarding internal \nrisk management processes under other relevant provisions of Union law, the aspects \nprovided in paragraphs 1 to 9 may be part of, or combined with, the risk management \nprocedures established \u258c pursuant to that law.\nArticle 10\nData and data governance\n1. High-risk AI systems which make use of techniques involving the training of AI models \nwith data shall be developed on the basis of training, validation and testing data sets that \nmeet the quality criteria referred to in paragraphs 2 to 5 whenever such data sets are used.\n2. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be subject to data governance and \nmanagement practices appropriate for the intended purpose of the high-risk AI system. \nThose practices shall concern in particular:\n(a) the relevant design choices;\n(b) data collection processes and the origin of data, and in the case of personal data, \nthe original purpose of the data collection;\n\u258c \n(c) relevant data-preparation processing operations, such as annotation, labelling, \ncleaning, updating, enrichment and aggregation;\n(d) the formulation of \u258c assumptions, in particular with respect to the information that \nthe data are supposed to measure and represent;\n(e)an assessment of the availability, quantity and suitability of the data sets that are \nneeded;\n(f) examination in view of possible biases that are likely to affect the health and safety \nof persons, have a negative impact on fundamental rights or lead to discrimination \nprohibited under Union law, especially where data outputs influence inputs for \nfuture operations;\n(g) appropriate measures to detect, prevent and mitigate possible biases identified \naccording to point (f);\n(h) the identification of relevant data gaps or shortcomings that prevent compliance \nwith this Regulation, and how those gaps and shortcomings can be addressed.\n3. Training, validation and testing data sets shall be relevant, sufficiently representative, and \nto the best extent possible, free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose. \nThey shall have the appropriate statistical properties, including, where applicable, as \nregards the persons or groups of persons in relation to whom the high-risk AI system is \nintended to be used. Those characteristics of the data sets may be met at the level of \nindividual data sets or at the level of a combination thereof.\n4.Data sets shall take into account, to the extent required by the intended purpose, the \ncharacteristics or elements that are particular to the specific geographical, contextual, \nbehavioural or functional setting within which the high-risk AI system is intended to be \nused.\n5. To the extent that it is strictly necessary for the purpose of ensuring bias \u258c detection and \ncorrection in relation to the high-risk AI systems in accordance with paragraph (2), points \n(f) and (g) of this Article, the providers of such systems may exceptionally process special \ncategories of personal data, subject to appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights \nand freedoms of natural persons. In addition to the provisions set out in Regulation (EU) \n2016/679, Directive (EU) 2016/680 and Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, all the following \nconditions shall apply in order for such processing to occur:\n(a) the bias detection and correction cannot be effectively fulfilled by processing other \ndata, including synthetic or anonymised data;\n(b) the special categories of personal data are subject to technical limitations on the \nre-use of the personal data, and state of the art security and privacy-preserving \nmeasures, including pseudonymisation;\n(c) the special categories of personal data are subject to measures to ensure that the \npersonal data processed are secured, protected, subject to suitable safeguards, \nincluding strict controls and documentation of the access, to avoid misuse and \nensure that only authorised persons with appropriate confidentiality obligations \nhave access to those personal data;\n(d) the personal data in the special categories of personal data are not to be \ntransmitted, transferred or otherwise accessed by other parties;\n(e) the personal data in the special categories of personal data are deleted once the \nbias has been corrected or the personal data has reached the end of its retention \nperiod, whichever comes first;\n(f) the records of processing activities pursuant to Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and \n(EU) 2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680include the reasons why the \nprocessing of special categories of personal data was strictly necessary to detect \nand correct biases, and why that objective could not be achieved by processing \nother data.\n6.\u258cFor the development of high-risk AI systems not using techniques involving the training \nof AI models, paragraphs 2 to 5 apply only to the testing data sets.\nArticle 11\nTechnical documentation\n1. The technical documentation of a high-risk AI system shall be drawn up before that system \nis placed on the market or put into service and shall be kept up-to date.\nThe technical documentation shall be drawn up in such a way as to demonstrate that the \nhigh-risk AI system complies with the requirements set out in this Section and to provide \nnational competent authorities and notified bodies with the necessary information in a \nclear and comprehensive form to assess the compliance of the AI system with those \nrequirements. It shall contain, at a minimum, the elements set out in Annex IV. SMEs, \nincluding start-ups, may provide the elements of the technical documentation specified \nin Annex IV in a simplified manner. For this purpose, the Commission shall establish a \nsimplified technical documentation form targeted at the needs of small and \nmicroenterprises. Where an SME, including a start-up, opts to provide the information \nrequired in Annex IV in a simplified manner, it shall use the form referred to in this \nparagraph. Notified bodies shall accept the form for the purposes of the conformity \nassessment.\n2. Where a high-risk AI system related to a product covered by the Union harmonisation \nlegislation listed in Section A of Annex I is placed on the market or put into service, a \nsingle set of technical documentation shall be drawn up containing all the information set \nout in paragraph 1, as well as the information required under those legal acts.\n3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend Annex \nIV where necessary to ensure that, in the light of technical progress, the technical \ndocumentation provides all the information necessary to assess the compliance of the \nsystem with the requirements set out in this Section.\nArticle 12\nRecord-keeping\n1. High-risk AI systems shall technically allow for the automatic recording of events (\u2018logs\u2019) \nover their lifetime.\n2.In order to ensure a level of traceability of the functioning of a high-risk AI system \u258c that \nis appropriate to the intended purpose of the system, logging capabilities shall enable the \nrecording of events relevant for:\n(a) identifying situations that may result in the high-risk AI system presenting a risk \nwithin the meaning of Article 79(1) or in a substantial modification;\n(b) facilitating the post-market monitoring referred to in Article 72; and\n(c) monitoring the operation of high-risk AI systems referred to in Article 26(6).\n\u258c\n3.

Notified bodies shall verify the conformity of high-risk AI systems in accordance with \nthe conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 43.\n2. Notified bodies shall avoid unnecessary burdens for providers when performing their \nactivities, and take due account of the size of the provider, the sector in which it \noperates, its structure and the degree of complexity of the high-risk AI system \nconcerned, in particular in view of minimising administrative burdens and compliance \ncosts for micro- and small enterprises within the meaning of Recommendation \n2003/361/EC. The notified body shall, nevertheless, respect the degree of rigour and the \nlevel of protection required for the compliance of the high-risk AI system with the \nrequirements of this Regulation. .\n3. Notified bodies shall make available and submit upon request all relevant \ndocumentation, including the providers\u2019 documentation, to the notifying authority \nreferred to in Article 28 to allow that authority to conduct its assessment, designation, \nnotification and monitoring activities, and to facilitate the assessment outlined in this \nSection.\nArticle 35\nIdentification numbers and lists of notified bodies \n1. The Commission shall assign a single identification number to each notified body, even \nwhere a body is notified under more than one Union act.\n2. The Commission shall make publicly available the list of the bodies notified under this \nRegulation, including their identification numbers and the activities for which they have \nbeen notified. The Commission shall ensure that the list is kept up to date.\nArticle 36\nChanges to notifications\n1. The notifying authority shall notify the Commission and the other Member States of any \nrelevant changes to the notification of a notified body via the electronic notification tool \nreferred to in Article 30(2).\n2. The procedures laid down in Articles 29 and 30 shall apply to extensions of the scope of \nthe notification. \nFor changes to the notification other than extensions of its scope, the procedures laid \ndown in the following paragraphs shall apply.\n3. Where a notified body decides to cease its conformity assessment activities, it shall \ninform the notifying authority and the providers concerned as soon as possible and, in \nthe case of a planned cessation, at least one year before ceasing its activities. The \ncertificates of the notified body may remain valid for a temporary period of nine months \nafter cessation of the notified body\u2019s activities, on condition that another notified body \nhas confirmed in writing that it will assume responsibilities for the high risk AI systems \ncovered by those certificates. The latter notified body shall complete a full assessment of \nthe AI systems affected by the end of that nine-month-period before issuing new \ncertificates for those systems. Where the notified body has ceased its activity, the \nnotifying authority shall withdraw the designation.\n4. Where a notifying authority has sufficient reason to consider that a notified body no \nlonger meets the requirements laid down in Article 31, or that it is failing to fulfil its \nobligations, the notifying authority shall without delay investigate the matter with the \nutmost diligence. In that context, it shall inform the notified body concerned about the \nobjections raised and give it the possibility to make its views known. If the notifying \nauthority comes to the conclusion that the notified body \u258c no longer meets the \nrequirements laid down in Article 31 or that it is failing to fulfil its obligations, it shall \nrestrict, suspend or withdraw \u258cthe designation as appropriate, depending on the \nseriousness of the failure to meet those requirements or fulfil those obligations. It shall \u258c \nimmediately inform the Commission and the other Member States accordingly.\n5. Where its designation has been suspended, restricted, or fully or partially withdrawn, the \nnotified body shall inform the providers concerned at the latest within 10 days.\n6. In the event of the restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a designation, the notifying \nauthority shall take appropriate steps to ensure that the files of the notified body \nconcerned are kept, and to make them available to notifying authorities in other Member \nStates and to market surveillance authorities at their request.\n7. In the event of the restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a designation, the notifying \nauthority shall:\n(a) assess the impact on the certificates issued by the notified body;\n(b) submit a report on its findings to the Commission and the other Member States \nwithin three months of having notified the changes to the designation;\n(c) require the notified body to suspend or withdraw, within a reasonable period of \ntime determined by the authority, any certificates which were unduly issued, in \norder to ensure the continuing conformity of AI systems on the market;\n(d) inform the Commission and the Member States about certificates the suspension or \nwithdrawal of which it has required;\n(e) provide the national competent authorities of the Member State in which the \nprovider has its registered place of business with all relevant information about the \ncertificates of which it has required the suspension or withdrawal; that authority \nshall take the appropriate measures, where necessary, to avoid a potential risk to \nhealth, safety or fundamental rights.\n8. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been \nsuspended or restricted, the certificates shall remain valid in one of the following \ncircumstances:\n(a) the notifying authority has confirmed, within one month of the suspension or \nrestriction, that there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights in relation \nto certificates affected by the suspension or restriction, and the notifying authority \nhas outlined a timeline for actions to remedy the suspension or restriction; or\n(b) the notifying authority has confirmed that no certificates relevant to the \nsuspension will be issued, amended or re-issued during the course of the \nsuspension or restriction, and states whether the notified body has the capability of \ncontinuing to monitor and remain responsible for existing certificates issued for \nthe period of the suspension or restriction; In the event that the notifying authority \ndetermines that the notified body does not have the capability to support existing \ncertificates issued, the provider of the system covered by the certificate shall \nconfirm in writing to the national competent authorities of the Member State in \nwhich it has its registered place of business, within three months of the suspension \nor restriction, that another qualified notified body is temporarily assuming the \nfunctions of the notified body to monitor and remain responsible for the \ncertificates during the period of suspension or restriction.\n9. With the exception of certificates unduly issued, and where a designation has been \nwithdrawn, the certificates shall remain valid for a period of nine months under the \nfollowing circumstances:\n(a) the national competent authority of the Member State in which the provider of the \nAI system covered by the certificate has its registered place of business has \nconfirmed that there is no risk to health, safety or fundamental rights associated \nwith the high-risk AI systems concerned; and\n(b) another notified body has confirmed in writing that it will assume immediate \nresponsibilities for assessing those AI systems and completes its assessment within \n12 months of the withdrawal of the designation.\nIn the circumstances referred to in the first subparagraph, the national competent \nauthority of the Member State in which the provider of the system covered by the \ncertificate has its place of business may extend the provisional validity of the certificates \nfor additional periods of three months, which shall not exceed 12 months in total.\nThe national competent authority or the notified body assuming the functions of the \nnotified body affected by the change of designation shall immediately inform the \nCommission, the other Member States and the other notified bodies thereof.\nArticle 37\nChallenge to the competence of notified bodies\n1. The Commission shall, where necessary, investigate all cases where there are reasons to \ndoubt the competence of a notified body or the continued fulfilment by a notified body of \nthe requirements laid down in Article 31 and of its applicable responsibilities.\n2. The notifying authority shall provide the Commission, on request, with all relevant \ninformation relating to the notification or the maintenance of the competence of the \nnotified body concerned.\n3. The Commission shall ensure that all sensitive information obtained in the course of its \ninvestigations pursuant to this Article is treated confidentially in accordance with \nArticle 78.\n4. Where the Commission ascertains that a notified body does not meet or no longer meets \nthe requirements for its notification, it shall inform the notifying Member State \naccordingly and request it to take the necessary corrective measures, including the \nsuspension or withdrawal of the notification if necessary. Where the Member State fails \nto take the necessary corrective measures, the Commission may, by means of an \nimplementing act, suspend, restrict or withdraw the designation. That implementing act \nshall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).\nArticle 38\nCoordination of notified bodies\n1. The Commission shall ensure that, with regard to high-risk AI systems, appropriate \ncoordination and cooperation between notified bodies active in the conformity assessment \nprocedures \u258c pursuant to this Regulation are put in place and properly operated in the form \nof a sectoral group of notified bodies.\n2. Each notifying authority shall ensure that the bodies notified by it participate in the work \nof a group referred to in paragraph 1, directly or through designated representatives.\n3. The Commission shall provide for the exchange of knowledge and best practices between \nthe notifying authorities of the Member States.\nArticle 39\nConformity assessment bodies of third countries\nConformity assessment bodies established under the law of a third country with which the Union \nhas concluded an agreement may be authorised to carry out the activities of notified bodies under \nthis Regulation, provided that they meet the requirements in Article 31 or they ensure an \nequivalent level of compliance.\nSection 5\nStandards, conformity assessment, certificates, registration\nArticle 40\nHarmonised standards and standardisation deliverables\n1. High-risk AI systems which are in conformity with harmonised standards or parts thereof \nthe references of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union \nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 shall be presumed to be in conformity \nwith the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, with the \nobligations set out in Chapter IV of this Regulation, to the extent that those standards \ncover those requirements or obligations.\n2. The Commission shall issue standardisation requests covering all requirements set out \nin Section 2 of this Chapter and, as applicable, obligations set out in Chapter IV of this \nRegulation, in accordance with Article 10 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, without \nundue delay. The standardisation request shall also ask for deliverables on reporting \nand documentation processes to improve AI systems\u2019 resource performance, such as \nreducing the high-risk AI system\u2019s consumption of energy and other resources \nconsumption during its lifecycle, and on the energy-efficient development of general-\npurpose AI models. When preparing a standardisation request, the Commission shall \nconsult the Board and relevant stakeholders, including the advisory forum.\nWhen issuing a standardisation request to European standardisation organisations, the \nCommission shall specify that standards have to be clear, consistent, including with the \nstandards developed in the various sectors for products covered by the existing Union \nharmonisation legislation listed in Annex I, and aiming to ensure that AI systems or AI \nmodels placed on the market or put into service in the Union meet the relevant \nrequirements laid down in this Regulation.\nThe Commission shall request the European standardisation organisations to provide \nevidence of their best efforts to fulfil the objectives referred to in the first and the second \nsubparagraph of this paragraph in accordance with Article 24 of Regulation (EU) No \n1025/2012.\n3. The participants in the standardisation process shall seek to promote investment and \ninnovation in AI, including through increasing legal certainty, as well as the \ncompetitiveness and growth of the Union market, and shall contribute to strengthening \nglobal cooperation on standardisation and taking into account existing international \nstandards in the field of AI that are consistent with Union values, fundamental rights \nand interests, and shall enhance multi-stakeholder governance ensuring a balanced \nrepresentation of interests and the effective participation of all relevant stakeholders in \naccordance with Articles 5, 6, and 7 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 41\nCommon specifications\n1.The Commission is empowered to adopt, implementing acts establishing common \nspecifications for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter or, as applicable, \nfor the obligations set out in Chapter IV where the following conditions have been \nfulfilled:\n(a) the Commission has requested, pursuant to Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) \nNo 1025/2012, one or more European standardisation organisations to draft a \nharmonised standard for the requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter, \nand:\n(i) the request has not been accepted by any of the European standardisation \norganisations; or\n(ii) the harmonised standards addressing that request are not delivered within \nthe deadline set in accordance with Article 10(1) of Regulation (EU) \nNo 1025/2012; or\n(iii) the relevant harmonised standards insufficiently address fundamental rights \nconcerns; or\n(iv) the harmonised standards do not comply with the request; and\n(b) no reference to harmonised standards covering the requirements referred to in \nSection 2 of this Title has been published in the Official Journal of the European \nUnion in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012, and no such reference \nis expected to be published within a reasonable period.\nThe implementing acts referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph shall be \nadopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2), \nafter consulting the advisory forum referred to in Article 67.\n2. Before preparing a draft implementing act, the Commission shall inform the committee \nreferred to in Article 22 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 that it considers the \nconditions laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article to be fulfilled.\n3. High-risk AI systems which are in conformity with the common specifications referred to \nin paragraph 1, or parts of those specifications, shall be presumed to be in conformity with \nthe requirements set out in Section 2, to the extent those common specifications cover \nthose requirements.\n4. Where a harmonised standard is adopted by a European standardisation organisation \nand proposed to the Commission for the publication of its reference in the Official \nJournal of the European Union, the Commission shall assess the harmonised standard \nin accordance with Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012. When reference to a harmonised \nstandard is published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the Commission \nshall repeal the implementing acts referred to in paragraph 1, or parts thereof which \ncover the same requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter.\n5. Where providers of high-risk AI systems do not comply with the common specifications \nreferred to in paragraph 1, they shall duly justify that they have adopted technical solutions \nthat meet the requirements referred to in Section 2 to a level at least equivalent thereto.\n6. Where a Member State considers that a common specification does not entirely meet the \nrequirements set out in Section 2, it shall inform the Commission thereof with a detailed \nexplanation. The Commission shall assess that information and, if appropriate, amend \nthe implementing act establishing the common specification concerned.\nArticle 42\nPresumption of conformity with certain requirements\n1.\u258cHigh-risk AI systems that have been trained and tested on data reflecting the specific \ngeographical, behavioural, contextual or functional setting within which they are intended \nto be used shall be presumed to be in compliance with the relevant requirements laid \ndown in Article 10(4).\n2. High-risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has \nbeen issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/881 and the \nreferences of which have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union \nshall be presumed to be in compliance with the cybersecurity requirements set out in \nArticle 15 of this Regulation in so far as the cybersecurity certificate or statement of \nconformity or parts thereof cover those requirements.\nArticle 43\nConformity assessment\n1. For high-risk AI systems listed in point 1 of Annex III, where, in demonstrating the \ncompliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out in Section 2, the \nprovider has applied harmonised standards referred to in Article 40, or, where applicable, \ncommon specifications referred to in Article 41, the provider shall opt for one of the \nfollowing conformity assessment procedures based on:\n(a) the internal control referred to in Annex VI; or\n(b) the assessment of the quality management system and the assessment of the technical \ndocumentation, with the involvement of a notified body, referred to in Annex VII.\n\u258cIn demonstrating the compliance of a high-risk AI system with the requirements set out \nin Section 2, the provider shall follow the conformity assessment procedure set out in \nAnnex VII where:\n(a)harmonised standards referred to in Article 40 \u258c do not exist, and common \nspecifications referred to in Article 41 are not available;\n(b)the provider has not applied, or has applied only part of, the harmonised standard;\n(c) the common specifications referred to in point (a) exist, but the provider has not \napplied them;\n(d) one or more of the harmonised standards referred to in point (a) has been \npublished with a restriction, and only on the part of the standard that was \nrestricted.\nFor the purposes of the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII, the \nprovider may choose any of the notified bodies. However, where the high-risk AI system is \nintended to be put into service by law enforcement, immigration or asylum authorities or \nby Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, the market surveillance authority \nreferred to in Article 74(8) or (9), as applicable, shall act as a notified body.\n2. For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 2 to 8 of Annex III, \u258c providers shall follow \nthe conformity assessment procedure based on internal control as referred to in Annex VI, \nwhich does not provide for the involvement of a notified body. \u258c\n3. For high-risk AI systems covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Section \nA of Annex I,,, the provider shall follow the relevant conformity assessment procedure as \nrequired under those legal acts. The requirements set out in Section 2 of this Chapter shall \napply to those high-risk AI systems and shall be part of that assessment. Points 4.3., 4.4., \n4.5. and the fifth paragraph of point 4.6 of Annex VII shall also apply.\nFor the purposes of that assessment, notified bodies which have been notified under those \nlegal acts shall be entitled to control the conformity of the high-risk AI systems with the \nrequirements set out in Section 2, provided that the compliance of those notified bodies \nwith requirements laid down in Article 31(4), (10) and (11) has been assessed in the \ncontext of the notification procedure under those legal acts.\nWhere a legal act listed in section A of Annex I enables the product manufacturer to opt \nout from a third-party conformity assessment, provided that that manufacturer has applied \nall harmonised standards covering all the relevant requirements, that manufacturer may use \nthat option only if it has also applied harmonised standards or, where applicable, common \nspecifications referred to in Article 41, covering the requirements set out in Section 2 of \nthis Chapter.\n4. High-risk AI systems that have already been subject to a conformity assessment \nprocedure shall undergo a new conformity assessment procedure in the event of a \nsubstantial modification, regardless of whether the modified system is intended to be \nfurther distributed or continues to be used by the current deployer.\nFor high-risk AI systems that continue to learn after being placed on the market or put into \nservice, changes to the high-risk AI system and its performance that have been pre-\ndetermined by the provider at the moment of the initial conformity assessment and are part \nof the information contained in the technical documentation referred to in point 2(f) of \nAnnex IV, shall not constitute a substantial modification.\n5. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to update \nAnnexes VI and VII in \u258c light of technical progress.\n6. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 amending \nparagraphs 1 and 2 of this Article in order to subject high-risk AI systems referred to in \npoints 2 to 8 of Annex III to the conformity assessment procedure referred to in Annex VII \nor parts thereof. The Commission shall adopt such delegated acts taking into account the \neffectiveness of the conformity assessment procedure based on internal control referred to \nin Annex VI in preventing or minimising the risks to health and safety and protection of \nfundamental rights posed by such systems, as well as the availability of adequate capacities \nand resources among notified bodies.\nArticle 44\nCertificates\n1. Certificates issued by notified bodies in accordance with Annex VII shall be drawn-up in a \nlanguage which can be easily understood by the relevant authorities in the Member State \nin which the notified body is established.\n2. Certificates shall be valid for the period they indicate, which shall not exceed five years for \nAI systems covered by Annex I, and four years for AI systems covered by Annex III. On \nthe application of the provider, the validity of a certificate may be extended for further \nperiods, each not exceeding five years for AI systems covered by Annex I, and four years \nfor AI systems covered by Annex III, based on a re-assessment in accordance with the \napplicable conformity assessment procedures. Any supplement to a certificate shall \nremain valid, provided that the certificate which it supplements is valid.\n3. Where a notified body finds that an AI system no longer meets the requirements set out in \nSection 2, it shall, taking account of the principle of proportionality, suspend or withdraw \nthe certificate issued or impose restrictions on it, unless compliance with those \nrequirements is ensured by appropriate corrective action taken by the provider of the \nsystem within an appropriate deadline set by the notified body. The notified body shall \ngive reasons for its decision.\n\u258cAn appeal procedure against decisions of the notified bodies, including against \nconformity certificates issued, shall be available.\nArticle 45\nInformation obligations of notified bodies\n1. Notified bodies shall inform the notifying authority of the following: \n(a) any Union technical documentation assessment certificates, any supplements to those \ncertificates, and any quality management system approvals issued in accordance with \nthe requirements of Annex VII;\n(b) any refusal, restriction, suspension or withdrawal of a Union technical \ndocumentation assessment certificate or a quality management system approval \nissued in accordance with the requirements of Annex VII;\n(c) any circumstances affecting the scope of or conditions for notification;\n(d) any request for information which they have received from market surveillance \nauthorities regarding conformity assessment activities;\n(e) on request, conformity assessment activities performed within the scope of their \nnotification and any other activity performed, including cross-border activities and \nsubcontracting.\n2. Each notified body shall inform the other notified bodies of:\n(a) quality management system approvals which it has refused, suspended or withdrawn, \nand, upon request, of quality system approvals which it has issued;\n(b) Union technical documentation assessment certificates or any supplements thereto \nwhich it has refused, withdrawn, suspended or otherwise restricted, and, upon \nrequest, of the certificates and/or supplements thereto which it has issued.\n3. Each notified body shall provide the other notified bodies carrying out similar conformity \nassessment activities covering the same types of AI systems with relevant information on \nissues relating to negative and, on request, positive conformity assessment results.\n4. The obligations referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall be complied \nwith in accordance with Article 78.\nArticle 46\nDerogation from conformity assessment procedure\n1. By way of derogation from Article 43 and upon a duly justified request, any market \nsurveillance authority may authorise the placing on the market or the putting into service of \nspecific high-risk AI systems within the territory of the Member State concerned, for \nexceptional reasons of public security or the protection of life and health of persons, \nenvironmental protection or the protection of key industrial and infrastructural assets. That \nauthorisation shall be for a limited period \u258c while the necessary conformity assessment \nprocedures are being carried out, taking into account the exceptional reasons justifying \nthe derogation. The completion of those procedures shall be undertaken without undue \ndelay.\n2. In a duly justified situation of urgency for exceptional reasons of public security or in \nthe case of specific, substantial and imminent threat to the life or physical safety of \nnatural persons, law-enforcement authorities or civil protection authorities may put a \nspecific high-risk AI system into service without the authorisation referred to in \nparagraph 1, provided that such authorisation is requested during or after the use \nwithout undue delay. If the authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 is refused, the use \nof the high-risk AI system shall be stopped with immediate effect and all the results and \noutputs of such use shall be immediately discarded.\n3. The authorisation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be issued only if the market surveillance \nauthority concludes that the high-risk AI system complies with the requirements of Section \n2. The market surveillance authority shall inform the Commission and the other Member \nStates of any authorisation issued pursuant to paragraph 1. This obligation shall not cover \nsensitive operational data in relation to the activities of law-enforcement authorities. \n4. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the information referred to in paragraph 3, no \nobjection has been raised by either a Member State or the Commission in respect of an \nauthorisation issued by a market surveillance authority of a Member State in accordance \nwith paragraph 1, that authorisation shall be deemed justified.\n5. Where, within 15 calendar days of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 3, \nobjections are raised by a Member State against an authorisation issued by a market \nsurveillance authority of another Member State, or where the Commission considers the \nauthorisation to be contrary to Union law, or the conclusion of the Member States \nregarding the compliance of the system as referred to in paragraph 3 to be unfounded, the \nCommission shall, without delay, enter into consultations with the relevant Member State. \nThe operators concerned shall be consulted and have the possibility to present their views. \nHaving regard thereto, the Commission shall decide whether the authorisation is justified. \nThe Commission shall address its decision to the Member State concerned and to the \nrelevant operators.\n6. Where the Commission considers the authorisation unjustified, it shall be withdrawn by the \nmarket surveillance authority of the Member State concerned.\n7.\u258cFor high-risk AI systems related to products covered by Union harmonisation \nlegislation listed in Section A of Annex I, only the derogations from the conformity \nassessment established in that Union harmonisation legislation shall apply.\nArticle 47\nEU declaration of conformity\n1. The provider shall draw up a written machine readable, physical or electronically signed \nEU declaration of conformity for each high-risk AI system, and keep it at the disposal of \nthe national competent authorities for 10 years after the high-risk AI system has been \nplaced on the market or put into service. The EU declaration of conformity shall identify \nthe high-risk AI system for which it has been drawn up. A copy of the EU declaration of \nconformity shall be submitted to the relevant national competent authorities upon request.\n2. The EU declaration of conformity shall state that the high-risk AI system concerned meets \nthe requirements set out in Section 2. The EU declaration of conformity shall contain the \ninformation set out in Annex V, and shall be translated into a language that can be easily \nunderstood by the national competent authorities of the Member States in which the \nhigh-risk AI system is placed on the market or made available.\n3. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union harmonisation legislation which \nalso requires an EU declaration of conformity, a single EU declaration of conformity shall \nbe drawn up in respect of all Union law applicable to the high-risk AI system. The \ndeclaration shall contain all the information required to identify the Union harmonisation \nlegislation to which the declaration relates.\n4. By drawing up the EU declaration of conformity, the provider shall assume responsibility \nfor compliance with the requirements set out in Section 2. The provider shall keep the EU \ndeclaration of conformity up-to-date as appropriate.\n5. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 for the purpose \nof updating the content of the EU declaration of conformity set out in Annex V, in order to \nintroduce elements that become necessary in light of technical progress.\nArticle 48\nCE marking \n1. The CE marking shall be subject to the general principles set out in Article 30 of \nRegulation (EC) No 765/2008.\n2. For high-risk AI systems provided digitally, a digital CE marking shall be used, only if it \ncan easily be accessed via the interface from which that system is accessed or via an \neasily accessible machine-readable code or other electronic means.\n3. The CE marking shall be affixed visibly, legibly and indelibly for high-risk AI systems. \nWhere that is not possible or not warranted on account of the nature of the high-risk AI \nsystem, it shall be affixed to the packaging or to the accompanying documentation, as \nappropriate.\n4. Where applicable, the CE marking shall be followed by the identification number of the \nnotified body responsible for the conformity assessment procedures set out in Article 43. \nThe identification number of the notified body shall be affixed by the body itself or, under \nits instructions, by the provider or by the provider\u2019s authorised representative. The \nidentification number shall also be indicated in any promotional material which mentions \nthat the high-risk AI system fulfils the requirements for CE marking.\n5. Where high-risk AI systems are subject to other Union law which also provides for the \naffixing of the CE marking, the CE marking shall indicate that the high-risk AI system \nalso fulfil the requirements of that other law.\nArticle 49\nRegistration\n1. Before placing on the market or putting into service a high-risk AI system listed in \nAnnex III, with the exception of high-risk AI systems referred to in point 2 of Annex III, \nthe provider or, where applicable, the authorised representative shall register themselves \nand their system in the EU database referred to in Article 71.\n2.Before placing on the market or putting into service an AI system for which the provider \nhas concluded that it is not high-risk according to Article 6(3), that provider or, where \napplicable, the authorised representative shall register themselves and that system in the \nEU database referred to in Article 71.\n3.Before putting into service or using a high-risk AI system listed in Annex III, with the \nexception of high-risk AI systems listed in point 2 of Annex III, deployers who are public \nauthorities, agencies or bodies or persons acting on their behalf shall register \nthemselves, select the system and register its use in the EU database referred to in Article \n71.\n4.For high-risk AI systems referred to in points 1, 6 and 7 of Annex III, in the areas of law \nenforcement, migration, asylum and border control management, the registration \nreferred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article shall be in a secure non-public \nsection of the EU database referred to in Article 71 and shall include only the following \ninformation, as applicable, referred to in:\n(a) section A, points 1 to 10, of Annex VIII, with the exception of points 5a, 7 and 8;\n(b) section C, points 1 to 3, of Annex VIII,;\n(c)Section B, points 1 to 5, and points 8 and 9 of Annex VIII;\n(d) points 1 to 3, and point 5, of Annex IX.\nOnly the Commission and national authorities referred to in Article 74(8) shall have \naccess to the restricted sections of the EU database listed in the first subparagraph of \nthis paragraph.\n5. High-risk AI systems referred to in point 2 of Annex III shall be registered at national \nlevel.\nCHAPTER IV\nTRANSPARENCY OBLIGATIONS FOR PROVIDERS AND \nDEPLOYERS OF CERTAIN AI SYSTEMS \nArticle 50\nTransparency obligations for providers and users of certain AI systems\n1. Providers shall ensure that AI systems intended to interact directly with natural persons are \ndesigned and developed in such a way that the natural persons concerned are informed that \nthey are interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the point of view of a \nnatural person who is reasonably well-informed, observant and circumspect, taking into \naccount the circumstances and the context of use. This obligation shall not apply to AI \nsystems authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences, \nsubject to appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties, unless \nthose systems are available for the public to report a criminal offence.\n2. Providers of AI systems, including general-purpose AI systems, generating synthetic \naudio, image, video or text content, shall ensure that the outputs of the AI system are \nmarked in a machine-readable format and detectable as artificially generated or \nmanipulated. Providers shall ensure their technical solutions are effective, interoperable, \nrobust and reliable as far as this is technically feasible, taking into account the \nspecificities and limitations of various types of content, the costs of implementation and \nthe generally acknowledged state-of-the-art, as may be reflected in relevant technical \nstandards. This obligation shall not apply to the extent the AI systems perform an \nassistive function for standard editing or do not substantially alter the input data \nprovided by the deployer or the semantics thereof, or where authorised by law to detect, \nprevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences.\n3.Deployers of an emotion recognition system or a biometric categorisation system shall \ninform the natural persons exposed thereto of the operation of the system, and shall \nprocess the personal data in accordance with Regulations (EU) 2016/679 and (EU) \n2018/1725 and Directive (EU) 2016/680, as applicable. This obligation shall not apply to \nAI systems used for biometric categorisation and emotion recognition, which are \npermitted by law to detect, prevent or investigate criminal offences, subject to appropriate \nsafeguards for the rights and freedoms of third parties, and in compliance with Union \nlaw.\n4.Deployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates image, audio or video content \nconstituting a deep fake, shall disclose that the content has been artificially generated or \nmanipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the use is authorised by law to detect, \nprevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offence. Where the content forms part of an \nevidently artistic, creative, satirical, fictional analogous work or programme, the \ntransparency obligations set out in this paragraph are limited to disclosure of the \nexistence of such generated or manipulated content in an appropriate manner that does \nnot hamper the display or enjoyment of the work.\nDeployers of an AI system that generates or manipulates text which is published with the \npurpose of informing the public on matters of public interest shall disclose that the text \nhas been artificially generated or manipulated. This obligation shall not apply where the \nuse is authorised by law to detect, prevent, investigate or prosecute criminal offences or \nwhere the AI-generated content has undergone a process of human review or editorial \ncontrol and where a natural or legal person holds editorial responsibility for the \npublication of the content.\n5. The information referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 shall be provided to the natural persons \nconcerned in a clear and distinguishable manner at the latest at the time of the first \ninteraction or exposure. The information shall conform to the applicable accessibility \nrequirements.\n6. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not affect the requirements and obligations set out in Chapter III, \nand shall be without prejudice to other transparency obligations laid down in Union or \nnational law for deployers of AI systems.\n7. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at \nUnion level to facilitate the effective implementation of the obligations regarding the \ndetection and labelling of artificially generated or manipulated content. The \nCommission is empowered to adopt implementing acts to approve those codes of practice \nin accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 56 (6), (7) and (8). If it deems the \ncode is not adequate, the Commission is empowered to adopt an implementing act \nspecifying common rules for the implementation of those obligations in accordance with \nthe examination procedure laid down in Article 98(2).\nCHAPTER V\nGENERAL-PURPOSE AI MODELS\nSection 1\nClassification rules\nArticle 51\nClassification of general-purpose AI models as general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n1. A general-purpose AI model shall be classified as a general-purpose AI model with \nsystemic risk if it meets any of the following requirements:\n(a) it has high impact capabilities evaluated on the basis of appropriate technical tools \nand methodologies, including indicators and benchmarks;\n(b) based on a decision of the Commission, ex officio or following a qualified alert \nfrom the scientific panel, it has capabilities or an impact equivalent to those set out \nin point (a) having regard to the criteria set out in Annex XIII.\n2. A general-purpose AI model shall be presumed to have high impact capabilities \npursuant to paragraph 1, point (a), when the cumulative amount of computation used \nfor its training measured in FLOPs is greater than 10^25.\n3. The Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to amend the \nthresholds listed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article, as well as to supplement \nbenchmarks and indicators in light of evolving technological developments, such as \nalgorithmic improvements or increased hardware efficiency, when necessary, for these \nthresholds to reflect the state of the art.\nArticle 52\nProcedure\n1. Where a general-purpose AI model meets the requirement referred to in Article 51(1), \npoint (a), the relevant provider shall notify the Commission without delay and in any \nevent within two weeks after that requirement is met or it becomes known that it will be \nmet. That notification shall include the information necessary to demonstrate that the \nrelevant requirement has been met. If the Commission becomes aware of a general-\npurpose AI model presenting systemic risks of which it has not been notified, it may \ndecide to designate it as a model with systemic risk.\n2. The provider of a general purpose AI model that meets the requirement referred to in \nArticle 51(1), point (a), may present, with its notification, sufficiently substantiated \narguments to demonstrate that, exceptionally, although it meets that requirement, the \ngeneral purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, systemic \nrisks and therefore should not be classified as a general-purpose AI model with systemic \nrisk.\n3. Where the Commission concludes that the arguments submitted pursuant to paragraph 2 \nare not sufficiently substantiated and the relevant provider was not able to demonstrate \nthat the general-purpose AI model does not present, due to its specific characteristics, \nsystemic risks, it shall reject those arguments, and the general-purpose AI model shall be \nconsidered to be a general-purpose AI model with systemic risk.\n4. The Commission may designate a general-purpose AI model as presenting systemic \nrisks, ex officio or following a qualified alert from the scientific panel pursuant to \nArticle 90(1), point (a), on the basis of criteria set out in Annex XIII. \nThe Commission shall adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 97 to specify and \nupdate the criteria set out in Annex XIII.\n5. Upon a reasoned request of a provider whose model has been designated as a general-\npurpose AI model with systemic risk pursuant to paragraph 4, the Commission shall take \nthe request into account and may decide to reassess whether the general-purpose AI \nmodel can still be considered to present systemic risks on the basis of the criteria set out \nin Annex XIII. Such request shall contain objective, detailed and new reasons that have \narisen since the designation decision. Providers may request reassessment at the earliest \nsix months after the designation decision. Where the Commission, following its \nreassessment, decides to maintain the designation as a general-purpose AI model with \nsystemic risk, providers may request reassessment at the earliest six months after that \ndecision.\n6. The Commission shall ensure that a list of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk \nis published and shall keep that list up to date, without prejudice to the need to observe \nand protect intellectual property rights and confidential business information or trade \nsecrets in accordance with Union and national law.\nSection 2\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\nArticle 53\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\n1.

The mandate shall empower the authorised representative to be addressed, in addition to \nor instead of the provider, by the AI Office or the national competent authorities, on all \nissues related to ensuring compliance with this Regulation.\n4. The authorised representative shall terminate the mandate if it considers or has reason \nto consider the provider to be acting contrary to its obligations pursuant to this \nRegulation. In such a case, it shall also immediately inform the AI Office about the \ntermination of the mandate and the reasons therefor.\n5. The obligation set out in this Article shall not apply to providers of general-purpose AI \nmodels that are released under a free and open source licence that allows for the access, \nusage, modification, and distribution of the model, and whose parameters, including the \nweights, the information on the model architecture, and the information on model \nusage, are made publicly available, unless the general-purpose AI models present \nsystemic risks.\nSection 3\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models\n with systemic risk\nArticle 55\nObligations for providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk\n1. In addition to the obligations listed in Article 53, providers of general-purpose AI models \nwith systemic risk shall:\n(a) perform model evaluation in accordance with standardised protocols and tools \nreflecting the state-of-the-art, including conducting and documenting adversarial \ntesting of the model with a view to identifying and mitigating systemic risk;\n(b) assess and mitigate possible systemic risks at Union level, including their sources, \nthat may stem from the development, the placing on the market, or the use of \ngeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risk;\n(c) keep track of, document and report without undue delay to the AI Office and, as \nappropriate, to national competent authorities, relevant information about serious \nincidents and possible corrective measures to address them;\n(d) ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection for the general-purpose AI \nmodel with systemic risk and the physical infrastructure of the model.\n2. Providers of general-purpose AI models with systemic risk may rely on codes of practice \nwithin the meaning of Article 56 to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out \nin paragraph 1 of this Article, until a harmonised standard is published. Providers who \nare in compliance with a European harmonised standard shall be presumed to be in \ncompliance with the obligations set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. Providers of \ngeneral-purpose AI models with systemic risks who do not adhere to an approved code of \npractice shall demonstrate alternative adequate means of compliance for approval by the \nCommission.\n3. Any information or documentation obtained pursuant to this Article, including trade \nsecrets, shall be treated in compliance with the confidentiality obligations set out in \nArticle 78.\nArticle 56\nCodes of practice\n1. The AI Office shall encourage and facilitate the drawing up of codes of practice at \nUnion level in order to contribute to the proper application of this Regulation, taking \ninto account international approaches.\n2. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice cover at least \nthe obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, including the following issues:\n(a) means to ensure that the information referred to in Article 53(1), points (a) and (b), \nis kept up to date in the light of market and technological developments; \n(b) the adequate level of detail for the summary about the content used for training;\n(c) the identification of the type and nature of the systemic risks at Union level, \nincluding their sources, where appropriate;\n(d) the measures, procedures and modalities for the assessment and management of \nthe systemic risks at Union level, including the documentation thereof, which shall \nbe proportionate to the risks, take into consideration their severity and probability \nand take into account the specific challenges of tackling those risks in the light of \nthe possible ways in which such risks may emerge and materialise along the AI \nvalue chain.\n3. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models, as well as relevant \nnational competent authorities, to participate in the drawing-up of codes of practice. \nCivil society organisations, industry, academia and other relevant stakeholders, such as \ndownstream providers and independent experts, may support the process.\n4. The AI Office and the Board shall aim to ensure that the codes of practice clearly set out \ntheir specific objectives and contain commitments or measures, including key \nperformance indicators as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of those objectives, \nand that they take due account of the needs and interests of all interested parties, \nincluding affected persons, at Union level.\n5. The AI Office shall aim to ensure that participants to the codes of practice report \nregularly to the AI Office on the implementation of the commitments and the measures \ntaken and their outcomes, including as measured against the key performance indicators \nas appropriate. Key performance indicators and reporting commitments shall reflect \ndifferences in size and capacity between various participants.\n6. The AI Office and the Board shall regularly monitor and evaluate the achievement of \nthe objectives of the codes of practice by the participants and their contribution to the \nproper application of this Regulation. The AI Office and the Board shall assess whether \nthe codes of practice cover the obligations provided for in Articles 53 and 55, as well as \nthe issues listed in paragraph 2 of this Article, and shall regularly monitor and evaluate \nthe achievement of their objectives. They shall publish their assessment of the adequacy \nof the codes of practice. \nThe Commission may, by way of an implementing act, approve a code of practice and \ngive it a general validity within the Union. That implementing act shall be adopted in \naccordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 98(2).\n7. The AI Office may invite all providers of general-purpose AI models to adhere to the \ncodes of practice. For providers of general-purpose AI models not presenting systemic \nrisks this adherence may be limited to the obligations provided for in Article 53, unless \nthey declare explicitly their interest to join the full code.\n8. The AI Office shall, as appropriate, also encourage and facilitate the review and \nadaptation of the codes of practice, in particular in the light of emerging standards. The \nAI Office shall assist in the assessment of available standards.\n9. Codes of practice shall be ready at the latest by \u2026 [nine months from the date of entry into \nforce of this Regulation]. The AI Office shall take the necessary steps, including inviting \nproviders pursuant to paragraph 7. \nIf, by ... [12 months from the date of entry into force], a code of practice cannot be \nfinalised, or if the AI Office deems it is not adequate following its assessment under \nparagraph 6 of this Article, the Commission may provide, by means of implementing \nacts, common rules for the implementation of the obligations provided for in Articles 53 \nand 55, including the issues set out in paragraph 2 of this Article. Those implementing \nacts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in \nArticle 98(2).\nCHAPTER VI\nMEASURES IN SUPPORT OF INNOVATION\nArticle 57\nAI regulatory sandboxes\n1.Member States shall ensure that their competent authorities establish at least one AI \nregulatory sandbox at national level, which shall be operational by \u2026 [24 months from \nthe date of entry into force of this Regulation]. That sandbox may also be established \njointly with the competent authorities of one or more other Member States. The \nCommission may provide technical support, advice and tools for the establishment and \noperation of AI regulatory sandboxes.\nThe obligation under the first subparagraph may also be fulfilled by participating in an \nexisting sandbox in so far as that participation provides an equivalent level of national \ncoverage for the participating Member States.\n2. Additional AI regulatory sandboxes at regional or local level, or established jointly with \nthe competent authorities of other Member States may also be established.\n3. The European Data Protection Supervisor may also establish an AI regulatory sandbox \nfor Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and may exercise the roles and the \ntasks of national competent authorities in accordance with this Chapter.\n4. Member States shall ensure that the competent authorities referred to in paragraphs 1 \nand 2 allocate sufficient resources to comply with this Article effectively and in a timely \nmanner. Where appropriate, national competent authorities shall cooperate with other \nrelevant authorities, and may allow for the involvement of other actors within the AI \necosystem. This Article shall not affect other regulatory sandboxes established under \nUnion or national law. Member States shall ensure an appropriate level of cooperation \nbetween the authorities supervising those other sandboxes and the national competent \nauthorities.\n5. AI regulatory sandboxes established under paragraph (1) shall provide for a controlled \nenvironment that fosters innovation and facilitates the development, training, testing and \nvalidation of innovative AI systems for a limited time before their being placed on the \nmarket or put into service pursuant to a specific sandbox plan agreed between the \nprospective providers and the competent authority. Such regulatory sandboxes may \ninclude testing in real world conditions supervised in the sandbox.\n6. Competent authorities shall provide, as appropriate, guidance, supervision and support \nwithin the AI regulatory sandbox with a view to identifying risks, in particular to \nfundamental rights, health and safety, testing, mitigation measures, and their \neffectiveness in relation to the obligations and requirements of this Regulation and, \nwhere relevant, other Union and Member State law supervised within the sandbox.\n7. Competent authorities shall provide providers and prospective providers using the AI \nregulatory sandbox with guidance on regulatory expectations and how to fulfil the \nrequirements and obligations set out in this Regulation.\nUpon request of the provider or prospective provider of the AI system, the competent \nauthority shall provide a written proof of the activities successfully carried out in the \nsandbox. The competent authority shall also provide an exit report detailing the activities \ncarried out in the sandbox and the related results and learning outcomes. Providers may \nuse such documentation to demonstrate their compliance with this Regulation through \nthe conformity assessment process or relevant market surveillance activities. In this \nregard, the exit reports and the written proof provided by the national competent \nauthority shall be taken positively into account by market surveillance authorities and \nnotified bodies, with a view to accelerating conformity assessment procedures to a \nreasonable extent.\n8. Subject to the confidentiality provisions in Article 78, and with the agreement of the \nprovider or prospective provider, the Commission and the Board shall be authorised to \naccess the exit reports and shall take them into account, as appropriate, when exercising \ntheir tasks under this Regulation. If both the provider or prospective provider and the \nnational competent authority explicitly agree, the exit report may be made publicly \navailable through the single information platform referred to in this Article.\n9. The establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes shall aim to contribute to the following \nobjectives:\n(a) improving legal certainty to achieve regulatory compliance with this Regulation or, \nwhere relevant, other applicable Union and national law;\n(b) supporting the sharing of best practices through cooperation with the authorities \ninvolved in the AI regulatory sandbox;\n(c) fostering innovation and competitiveness and facilitating the development of an AI \necosystem;\n(d) contributing to evidence-based regulatory learning; \n(e) facilitating and accelerating access to the Union market for AI systems, in \nparticular when provided by SMEs, including start-ups.\n10.National competent authorities shall ensure that, to the extent the innovative AI systems \ninvolve the processing of personal data or otherwise fall under the supervisory remit of \nother national authorities or competent authorities providing or supporting access to data, \nthe national data protection authorities and those other national or competent authorities \nare associated with the operation of the AI regulatory sandbox and involved in the \nsupervision of those aspects to the extent of their respective tasks and powers.\n11. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall not affect the supervisory or corrective powers of the \ncompetent authorities supervising the sandboxes, including at regional or local level. Any \nsignificant risks to health and safety and fundamental rights identified during the \ndevelopment and testing of such AI systems shall result in an adequate mitigation. \nNational competent authorities shall have the power to temporarily or permanently \nsuspend the testing process, or the participation in the sandbox if no effective mitigation \nis possible, and shall inform the AI Office of such decision. National competent \nauthorities shall exercise their supervisory powers within the limits of the relevant law, \nusing their discretionary powers when implementing legal provisions in respect of a \nspecific AI sandbox project, with the objective of supporting innovation in AI in the \nUnion.\n12.Providers and prospective providers participating in the AI regulatory sandbox shall \nremain liable under applicable Union and national liability law for any damage inflicted on \nthird parties as a result of the experimentation taking place in the sandbox. However, \nprovided that the prospective providers observe the specific plan and the terms and \nconditions for their participation and follow in good faith the guidance given by the \nnational competent authority, no administrative fines shall be imposed by the authorities \nfor infringements of this Regulation. To the extent that other competent authorities \nresponsible for other Union and national law were actively involved in the supervision of \nthe AI system in the sandbox and provided guidance for compliance, no administrative \nfines shall be imposed regarding that law.\n13. The AI regulatory sandboxes shall be designed and implemented in such a way that, \nwhere relevant, they facilitate cross-border cooperation between national competent \nauthorities.\n14.National competent authorities \u258c shall coordinate their activities and cooperate within the \nframework of the \u258c Board. \u258c\n15. National competent authorities shall inform the AI Office and the Board of the \nestablishment of a sandbox, and may ask it for support and guidance. The AI Office \nshall make publicly available a list of planned and existing AI sandboxes and keep it up \nto date in order to encourage more interaction in the AI regulatory sandboxes and cross-\nborder cooperation.\n16. National competent authorities shall submit to the AI Office and to the Board, annual \nreports, starting one year after the establishment of the AI regulatory sandbox and every \nyear thereafter until its termination and a final report. Those reports shall provide \ninformation on the progress and results of the implementation of those sandboxes, \nincluding best practices, incidents, lessons learnt and recommendations on their setup \nand, where relevant, on the application and possible revision of this Regulation, \nincluding its delegated and implementing acts, and on the application of other Union \nlaw supervised by the competent authorities within the sandbox. The national competent \nauthorities shall make those annual reports or abstracts thereof available to the public, \nonline. The Commission shall, where appropriate, take the annual reports into account \nwhen exercising its tasks under this Regulation.\n17. The Commission shall develop a single and dedicated interface containing all relevant \ninformation related to AI regulatory sandboxes to allow stakeholders to interact with AI \nregulatory sandboxes and to raise enquiries with competent authorities, and to seek non-\nbinding guidance on the conformity of innovative products, services, business models \nembedding AI technologies, in accordance with Article 62(1), point (c). The Commission \nshall proactively coordinate with national competent authorities, where relevant.\nArticle 58\nDetailed arrangements for and functioning of AI regulatory sandboxes\n1. In order to avoid fragmentation across the Union, the Commission shall adopt \nimplementing acts specifying the detailed arrangements for the establishment, \ndevelopment, implementation, operation and supervision of the AI regulatory sandboxes. \nThe implementing acts shall include common principles on the following issues:\n(a) eligibility and selection criteria for participation in the AI regulatory sandbox;\n(b) procedures for the application, participation, monitoring, exiting from and \ntermination of the AI regulatory sandbox, including the sandbox plan and the exit \nreport;\n(c) the terms and conditions applicable to the participants.\nThose implementing acts shall be adopted in accordance with the examination \nprocedure referred to in Article 98(2).\n2.

AI systems presenting a risk shall be understood as a \u201cproduct presenting a risk\u201d as defined \nin Article 3, point 19 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, in so far as they present risks to the \nhealth or safety, or to \u258c fundamental rights, of persons.\n2. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State has sufficient reason to \nconsider an AI system to present a risk as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall \ncarry out an evaluation of the AI system concerned in respect of its compliance with all the \nrequirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Particular attention shall be \ngiven to AI systems presenting a risk to groups of vulnerable persons referred to in \nArticle 5. Where risks to fundamental rights of persons are identified, the market \nsurveillance authority shall also inform and fully cooperate with the relevant national \npublic authorities or bodies referred to in Article 77(1). The relevant operators shall \ncooperate as necessary with the market surveillance authority and with the other national \npublic authorities or bodies referred to in Article 77(1).\nWhere, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority or, where \napplicable the market surveillance authority in cooperation with the national public \nauthority referred to in Article 77(1), finds that the AI system does not comply with the \nrequirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, it shall without undue delay \nrequire the relevant operator to take all appropriate corrective actions to bring the AI \nsystem into compliance, to withdraw the AI system from the market, or to recall it within a \nperiod the market surveillance authority may prescribe, and in any event within the \nshorter of 15 working days, or as provided for in the relevant Union harmonisation \nlegislation.\nThe market surveillance authority shall inform the relevant notified body accordingly. \nArticle 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 shall apply to the measures referred to in the \nsecond subparagraph of this paragraph.\n3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that the non-compliance is not restricted \nto its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and the other Member States \nwithout undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the actions which it has \nrequired the operator to take.\n4. The operator shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all the \nAI systems concerned that it has made available on the Union market.\n5. Where the operator of an AI system does not take adequate corrective action within the \nperiod referred to in paragraph 2, the market surveillance authority shall take all \nappropriate provisional measures to prohibit or restrict the AI system's being made \navailable on its national market or put into service, to withdraw the product or the \nstandalone AI system from that market or to recall it. That authority shall without undue \ndelay notify the Commission and the other Member States \u258c of those measures.\n6. The notification referred to in paragraph 5 shall include all available details, in particular \nthe information necessary for the identification of the non-compliant AI system, the origin \nof the AI system and the supply chain, the nature of the non-compliance alleged and the \nrisk involved, the nature and duration of the national measures taken and the arguments put \nforward by the relevant operator. In particular, the market surveillance authorities shall \nindicate whether the non-compliance is due to one or more of the following:\n(a) non-compliance with the prohibition of the AI practices referred to in Article 5;\n(b) a failure of a high-risk AI system to meet requirements set out in Chapter III, \nSection 2;\n(c) shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications referred to in \nArticles 40 and 41 conferring a presumption of conformity;\n(d) non-compliance with Article 50.\n7.

Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 5 of this \nArticle, no objection has been raised by either a market surveillance authority of a \nMember State or by the Commission in respect of a provisional measure taken by a market \nsurveillance authority of another Member State, that measure shall be deemed justified. \nThis shall be without prejudice to the procedural rights of the concerned operator in \naccordance with Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020. The three-month period \nreferred to in this paragraph shall be reduced to 30 days in the event of non-compliance \nwith the prohibition of the AI practices referred to in Article 5 of this Regulation.\n9. The market surveillance authorities of the Member States shall ensure that appropriate \nrestrictive measures are taken in respect of the product or the AI system concerned, such as \nwithdrawal of the product or the AI system from their market, without undue delay.\nArticle 80\nProcedure for dealing with AI systems classified by the provider as\nnon-high-risk in application of Annex III\n1. Where a market surveillance authority has sufficient reason to consider that an AI \nsystem classified by the provider is not high-risk pursuant to Article 6(3)I is indeed high-\nrisk, the market surveillance authority shall carry out an evaluation of the AI system \nconcerned in respect of its classification as a high-risk AI system based on the conditions \nset out in Article 6(3) and the Commission guidelines.\n2. Where, in the course of that evaluation, the market surveillance authority finds that the \nAI system concerned is high-risk, it shall without undue delay require the relevant \nprovider to take all necessary actions to bring the AI system into compliance with the \nrequirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation, as well as take appropriate \ncorrective action within a period the market surveillance authority may prescribe.\n3. Where the market surveillance authority considers that the use of the AI system \nconcerned is not restricted to its national territory, it shall inform the Commission and \nthe other Member States without undue delay of the results of the evaluation and of the \nactions which it has required the provider to take.\n4. The provider shall ensure that all necessary action is taken to bring the AI system into \ncompliance with the requirements and obligations laid down in this Regulation. Where \nthe provider of an AI system concerned does not bring the AI system into compliance \nwith those requirements and obligations within the period referred to in paragraph 2 of \nthis Article, the provider shall be subject to fines in accordance with Article 99.\n5. The provider shall ensure that all appropriate corrective action is taken in respect of all \nthe AI systems concerned that it has made available on the Union market.\n6. Where the provider of the AI system concerned does not take adequate corrective action \nwithin the period referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, Article 79(5) to (9) shall \napply.\n7. Where, in the course of the evaluation pursuant to paragraph 1 of this Article, the \nmarket surveillance authority establishes that the AI system was misclassified by the \nprovider as not high-risk in order to circumvent the application of requirements in \nChapter III, Section 2, the provider shall be subject to fines in accordance with \nArticle 99.\n8. In exercising their power to monitor the application of this Article, and in accordance \nwith Article 11 of Regulation (EU) 2019/1020, market surveillance authorities may \nperform appropriate checks, taking into account in particular information stored in the \nEU database referred to in Article 71 of this Regulation.\nArticle 81\nUnion safeguard procedure\n1. Where, within three months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 79(5), or \nwithin 30 days in the case of non-compliance with the prohibition of the AI practices \nreferred to in Article 5, objections are raised by the market surveillance authority of a \nMember State to a measure taken by another market surveillance authority, or where the \nCommission considers the measure to be contrary to Union law, the Commission shall \nwithout undue delay enter into consultation with the market surveillance authority of the \nrelevant Member State and the operator or operators, and shall evaluate the national \nmeasure. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall, within six \nmonths, or within 60 days in the case of non-compliance with the prohibition of the AI \npractices referred to in Article 5, starting from the notification referred to in Article 79(5), \ndecide whether the national measure is justified and shall notify its decision to the market \nsurveillance authority of the Member State concerned. The Commission shall also inform \nall other market surveillance authorities of its decision.\n2. Where the Commission considers the measure taken by the relevant Member State to be \njustified, all Member States shall ensure that they take appropriate restrictive measures in \nrespect of the AI system concerned, such as requiring the withdrawal of the AI system \nfrom their market without undue delay, and shall inform the Commission accordingly. \nWhere the Commission considers the national measure to be unjustified, the Member State \nconcerned shall withdraw the measure and shall inform the Commission accordingly.\n3. Where the national measure is considered justified and the non-compliance of the AI \nsystem is attributed to shortcomings in the harmonised standards or common specifications \nreferred to in Articles 40 and 41 of this Regulation, the Commission shall apply the \nprocedure provided for in Article 11 of Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012.\nArticle 82\nCompliant AI systems which present a risk\n1. Where, having performed an evaluation under Article 79, after consulting the relevant \nnational public authority referred to in Article 77(1), the market surveillance authority of \na Member State finds that although a high-risk AI system is in compliance with this \nRegulation, it nevertheless presents a risk to the health or safety of persons, \u258c to \nfundamental rights of persons, or to other aspects of public interest protection, it shall \nrequire the relevant operator to take all appropriate measures to ensure that the AI system \nconcerned, when placed on the market or put into service, no longer presents that risk \nwithout undue delay, within a \u258c period \u258c it may prescribe.\n2. The provider or other relevant operator shall ensure that corrective action is taken in \nrespect of all the AI systems concerned that it has made available on the Union market \nwithin the timeline prescribed by the market surveillance authority of the Member State \nreferred to in paragraph 1.\n3. The Member States shall immediately inform the Commission and the other Member \nStates of a finding under paragraph 1. That information shall include all available details, \nin particular the data necessary for the identification of the AI system concerned, the origin \nand the supply chain of the AI system, the nature of the risk involved and the nature and \nduration of the national measures taken.\n4. The Commission shall without undue delay enter into consultation with the Member State \nor member States concerned and the relevant operators, and shall evaluate the national \nmeasures taken. On the basis of the results of that evaluation, the Commission shall decide \nwhether the measure is justified and, where necessary, propose other appropriate measures.\n5. The Commission shall immediately communicate its decision to the Member States \nconcerned and to the relevant operators. It shall also inform the other Member States.\nArticle 83\nFormal non-compliance\n1. Where the market surveillance authority of a Member State makes one of the following \nfindings, it shall require the relevant provider to put an end to the non-compliance \nconcerned, within a period it may prescribe:\n(a) a CE marking has been affixed in violation of Article 48;\n(b) a CE marking has not been affixed;\n(c) a EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up;\n(d) a EU declaration of conformity has not been drawn up correctly;\n(e) registration in the EU database has not been carried out;\n(f) where applicable, an authorised representative has not been appointed;\n(g) technical documentation is not available.\n2.

Recently, large Language\nModels (LLMs) have demonstrated revolutionary abilities in lan-\nguage understanding and generation, while still facing inherent\nlimitations, such as hallucinations and out-of-date internal knowl-\nedge. Given the powerful abilities of RAG in providing the latest\nand helpful auxiliary information, retrieval-augmented large lan-\nguage models have emerged to harness external and authoritative\nknowledge bases, rather than solely relying on the model\u2019s internal\nknowledge, to augment the generation quality of LLMs. In this\nsurvey, we comprehensively review existing research studies in\nretrieval-augmented large language models ( RA-LLMs ), covering\nthree primary technical perspectives: architectures, training strate-\ngies, and applications. As the preliminary knowledge, we briefly\nintroduce the foundations and recent advances of LLMs. Then, to\nillustrate the practical significance of RAG for LLMs, we categorize\nmainstream relevant work by application areas, detailing specifi-\ncally the challenges of each and the corresponding capabilities of\nRA-LLMs. Finally, to deliver deeper insights, we discuss current\nlimitations and several promising directions for future research.\nKEYWORDS\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Models\n(LLMs), Pre-training, Fine-tuning, In-context Learning, Prompting.\n1 INTRODUCTION\nAs one of the most fundamental data mining techniques, retrieval\naims to understand the input query and extract relevant information\nfrom external data sources [ 62,132]. It has found extensive applica-\ntion in various fields [ 8,100,170], such as search, question answer-\ning, and recommender systems. For instance, search engines (e.g.,\nGoogle, Bing, and Baidu) are the most successful applications of re-\ntrieval in the industry; they can filter and retrieve the most relevant\nweb pages or documents that can match a user\u2019s query [ 19,170],\nenabling users to find the desired information effectively. Mean-\nwhile, retrieval models, through effective data maintenance in exter-\nnal databases, can provide faithful and timely external knowledge,\nthereby serving vital functions in various knowledge-intensive\ntasks. Due to their powerful capacities, retrieval techniques have\nbeen successfully incorporated into advanced generative models\n\u2217Corresponding author: Wenqi Fan and Qing Li\nSpain won the\nWomen's World Cup\n2023.\nWhich country won\u00a0\nthe Women's World\nCup 2023?\nUserw/o RAG\nwith RAGPre-trained\nLLMs\nExternal\nDatabase\nOutputPrompt\nOutput\nPrompt\nQuery\nAdditional information:\nNew, Domain-specific, etc.ContextAs of my last update\nin January 2022, I\ncan't provide which\ncountry won ... 2023.\nFigure 1: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) meets\nLarge Language Models (LLMs). When the user\u2019s query is out-\nof-scope, e.g., unseen content in training data or the need for\nthe latest information for the answer, LLMs might show in-\nferior generation performance. With the help of RAG, LLMs\ncan leverage additional relevant information from external\ndata sources to enhance text generation capability.\nin the era of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) [72, 126, 155, 181]. No-\ntably, the integration of retrieval models with language models has\ngiven rise to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [ 69], which\nhas emerged as one of the most representative techniques in the\nfield of generative AI, aiming to enhance the generation quality of\ntext content [6, 69, 72].\nTo advance generation models and enhance the generated re-\nsults, RAG incorporates information or knowledge from external\ndata sources, which serves as supplementary for the input query\nor the generated output [ 57,97]. Specifically, RAG first invokes the\nretriever to search and extract the relevant documents from exter-\nnal databases, which are then leveraged as the context to enhance\nthe generation process [ 49]. In practice, RAG techniques are feasi-\nble and efficient to apply in various generation tasks with simple\nadaptation of the retrieval component, requiring minimal or even\nno additional training [ 111]. Recent studies have demonstrated the\ngreat potential of RAG not only for knowledge-intensive tasks such\nas the Open-domain Question Answering (OpenQA) [ 6,42,103],\nbut also for general language tasks [ 44,57,162], and various down-\nstream applications [84, 155].\nRecent years have witnessed the rapid development of pre-trained\nfoundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs),\nwhich have demonstrated impressive performance across vari-\nous tasks [ 1,18], including recommender systems [ 187], molecule\ndiscovery [ 72], and report generation [ 26]. The great success of\nLLMs can be technically attributed to the advanced architectures\nwith billion-level parameters pre-training on a huge amount of\n1arXiv:2405.06211v1  [cs.CL]  10 May 2024\nConference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYujuan Ding1, Wenqi Fan1\u2217, Liangbo Ning1, Shijie Wang1, Hengyun Li1,\nDawei Yin2, Tat-Seng Chua3, and Qing Li1\ntraining corpus from various sources. These technical improve-\nments have given rise to the remarkable emergence capabilities\nof LLMs [ 186,187], particularly in language understanding and\ngeneration, in-context learning, and others. For instance, GPT-FAR\nintroduces detailed prompts to teach GPT-4 to perform image tag-\nging, statistical analysis, and text analysis for multi-modal fashion\nreport generation [ 26]. LLMs also achieve promising performance\nin recommender systems by understanding users\u2019 preferences to-\nwards items [ 146,187]. Despite the success, LLMs still suffer from\nintrinsic limitations [ 186,187], such as the lack of domain-specific\nknowledge, the problem of \u201challucination\u201d, and the substantial com-\nputational resources for updating the models. These problems are\nparticularly notable in domain-specific fields like medicine and law.\nFor instance, a recent study has demonstrated that legal hallucina-\ntions are pervasive and disturbing, with hallucination rates ranging\nfrom 69% to 88% in response to specific legal queries for state-of-the-\nart LLMs [ 21]. Moreover, the challenges of tackling the hallucination\nproblem become even harder due to the substantial computational\nresources required for fine-tuning LLMs with domain-specific or\nthe latest data. This, in turn, significantly hinders the widespread\nadoption of LLMs in various real-world applications.\nTo address these limitations, recent efforts have been made to\ntake advantage of RAG to enhance the capabilities of LLMs in var-\nious tasks [ 6,48,57,128], especially those demanding high for\nthe latest and reliable knowledge such as Question Answer (QA),\nAI4Science, and software engineering. For example, Lozano et al .\n[86] introduces a scientific-specific QA system based on retriev-\ning scientific literature dynamically. MolReGPT leverages RAG to\nenhance the in-context learning ability of ChatGPT for molecu-\nlar discovery [ 72]. As illustrated in Figure 1, an LLM-based dialog\nsystem will not be able to answer well for out-of-scope queries.\nIn comparison, with the help of RAG to retrieve relevant knowl-\nedge from external data sources and integrate it into the process of\ngeneration, the dialog system succeeds in giving correct answers\nto the user. Given the remarkable progress in advancing LLMs\nwith RAG, there is an imperative need for a systematic review of\nrecent advances in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models\n(RA-LLM ).\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the\nretrieval-augmented large language models, i.e., RA-LLMs, by sum-\nmarizing representative methods from the aspects of RA-LLMs\u2019\narchitecture, training, and applications. More specifically, follow-\ning a brief introduction to the background knowledge of LLMs\nin Section 2, we review existing research from several primary\nperspectives of RA-LLMs in terms of retrieval, generation, and\naugmentation in Section 3, as well as the necessity and applica-\ntion frequency of retrieval in RAG. Then, we summarize the main\ntraining techniques of RA-LLMs in Section 4 and various RA-LLMs\napplications in Section 5. Finally, in Section 6, we discuss key chal-\nlenges and potential directions for future exploration.\nConcurrent to our survey, several related surveys have diverse fo-\ncuses for RAG and LLMs. For example, Zhao et al . [185] specifically\nreview multi-modal information-based RAG techniques and Zhao\net al. [184] discuss the RAG for AIGC. Gao et al . [37] conduct a rela-\ntively comprehensive overview of RAG for LLMs. Our survey differs\nfrom these surveys in concentrating on technical perspectives andsystematically reviewing models according to the architecture and\ntraining paradigm in RA-LLMs, as well as application tasks.\n2 BACKGROUND\nIn this section, we briefly present the background of large language\nmodels and prompt learning.\n2.1 Large Language Models (LLMs)\nRecently, the significant breakthrough of LLMs has revolutionized\nthe field of artificial intelligence [ 7,33,186]. The advanced LLMs\nare typically pre-trained on extensive data with billion-level param-\neters and have demonstrated the ability to understand and generate\nhuman-like text, leading to advancements in various natural lan-\nguage processing tasks such as text generation and information\nretrieval [ 186,187]. LLMs can be adapted to a variety of downstream\ntasks by fine-tuning them on specific datasets, allowing them to\nspecialize in particular domains or applications. In general, most\nexisting LLMs can be broadly divided into three main categories:\nEncoder-only, Decoder-only, and Encoder-Decoder models.\nEncoder-only models, such as the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers) [ 24] family of models, pro-\ncess input text by encoding it into a high-dimensional space. The\nkey feature of Encoder-only models is their bi-directional nature,\nmeaning that they can take into account both the left and right con-\ntext of each token when encoding it. This bi-directionality allows\nEncoder-only models to better understand the meaning of words in\ncontext, which is crucial for tasks like sentiment analysis, review\nreading, and text classification [ 24,161]. In contrast to these models,\nDecoder-only models generate text in a left-to-right fashion. As a\nrepresentative Decoder-only model, GPT (Generative Pre-trained\nTransformer) [ 108] predicts the next token in a sequence based on\nthe context provided by the previous tokens. Their architecture\nmakes them particularly effective for tasks like language generation,\ncode generation, and creative writing. Encoder-Decoder models,\nsuch as T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) [ 110], uniquely\ntransform a variety of NLP tasks into text generation problems. To\nbe more specific, the encoder in T5 processes the input sequence\nto capture its meaning, while the decoder generates the output\nsequence based on the encoded information. This T5 architecture\nis well-suited for tasks that involve converting one sequence into\nanother, such as machine translation, summarization, and conver-\nsational response generation.\n2.2 Prompt Learning\n2.2.1 Prompting Engineering. Due to the massive parameters of\nLLMs, prompt learning emerged as a paradigm to leverage the\npower of LLM to implement various tasks [ 186,187], instead of\nfine-tuning the LLMs extensively. Prompt learning carefully designs\nthe input that guides the model to perform downstream tasks in\nLLMs. For example, early methods [ 7,104] provide manually crafted\ntemplates to handle various tasks in NLP. Specifically, Encoder-only\nmodels like BERT typically adopt cloze prompts because they very\nclosely match the form of their pre-training task [ 20,104]. For\nother models like GPT, prefix prompts tend to be more suitable as\nthey mesh well with the generation tasks [ 7]. However, manually\ndesigned prompts rely on human experience without effectiveness\n2\nA Survey on RAG Meets LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nguarantees. To address this limitation, soft prompt tuning was\ndeveloped to learn the trainable continuous prompt embeddings [ 77,\n142,143]. For instance, Prefix-Tuning [ 77] prepends a series of prefix\nembedding in the input, which can be trained and updated. This\napportion allows prompts not to be real text, giving more flexibility\nin the generation of prompts. However, due to the lack of domain-\nspecific knowledge, the model might still not generate accurate\nresponses when facing new tasks.\n2.2.2 In-Context Learning (ICL). To overcome the limitations of\nvanilla prompt learning, recent efforts [ 61,83,183] have developed\nin-context learning (ICL). ICL is a specific method of prompt learn-\ning that gives the model a few demonstrations of tasks within the\nprompt. This paradigm allows pre-trained LLMs to understand the\npattern provided by the demonstrations to solve novel tasks with-\nout the need for fine-tuning. For example, by carefully selecting a\nfew demonstrations, GPT-3 [ 7] has shown the capability to perform\nfew-shot tasks [ 83]. This success indicates that LLMs have a remark-\nable ability to rapidly adapt to new tasks based on task-specific\nknowledge.\nDespite its effectiveness, ICL usually relies heavily on the quality\nof the provided demonstrations, which may lead to the generation\nof sub-optimal outputs. Even worse, ICL may not have enough\nnecessary information or prior knowledge to guide the LLMs in\ngenerating accurate responses. To address the aforementioned limi-\ntations of ICL, more recent studies introduce Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) technologies [ 69,111,128]. By integrating re-\ntrieval with generation, RAG models provide a promising direction\nfor enhancing the performance and adaptability of LLMs across\nvarious tasks.\n3 RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED LARGE\nLANGUAGE MODELS (RA-LLMS)\nThe RAG framework in the era of LLMs generally consists of three\nmajor processes of retrieval, generation , and augmentation , as well\nas the mechanism to determine whether the retrieval is needed. In\nthis section, we will introduce important techniques involved in\neach component.\n3.1 Retrieval\nGiven the query from the input of LLMs, the retrieval process in\nRAG aims to provide relevant information from the external knowl-\nedge sources, which can be either open-sourced or closed-sourced\nas shown in Figure 2. The key component, retriever, as further\ndetailed in Figure 3, consists of several procedures, functioning as a\nwhole to measure the relevance between the query and documents\nin the database for effective information retrieval. The specific\npipeline of the retrieval is further determined by whether the pre-\nand post-retrieval processes are included. In this subsection, we will\nintroduce the major techniques involved in the retrieval of tradi-\ntional and LLM-based RAGs, including the retriever type, retrieval\ngranularity, pre- and post-retrieval enhancement, and database\nconstruction.\n3.1.1 Retriever Type. Retrieval methods can be generally catego-\nrized into two types: sparse and dense, based on the information\nencoding methods. Sparse retrieval is word-based and applied intext retrieval mostly, while dense retrieval embeds queries and ex-\nternal knowledge into vector spaces and is easily applied to various\ndata formats.\nAs a straightforward approach, sparse retrieval, e.g., TF-IDF and\nBM25 [ 119,135], usually relies on inverted index matching along\nwith the raw data input. For example, many studies directly apply\nBM25 for passage-level retrieval to facilitate their RAG [ 10,52,\n111,160,188,189], where passages are specifically represented as\na bag of words and ranked based on term and inverse document\nfrequencies [ 49]. On top of offering supplementary to enhance the\ninput of the generator, sparse retrieval has also been used to find\nexamples as demonstrations for ICL for RA-LLMs [ 2,90,120,130,\n167]. The main limitation of applying sparse retrieval in RAG is its\nno-training nature, which makes the retrieval performance heavily\nrely on the quality of database construction and query generation.\nMoreover, such fixed term-based methods only support similarity\nretrieval, while cannot be adapted for other retrieval considerations\ndemanding in LLM applications, such as the diversity [28].\nDense retrieval, on the contrary, embeds the query and docu-\nments into continuous vector space with certain criteria, for ex-\nample, semantic similarity [ 56]. Dense retrieval methods can often\nbe trained, therefore hold more flexibility and potential in adap-\ntation. As the key component of dense retriever, the embedding\nmodels have delicately different designs in existing RAG models.\nA simple design [ 57,67,157,171] is to directly use a part of the\ngeneration model as the embedding layer of the retriever, which\nmight be able to enhance the alignment between the retrieval and\ngeneration processes. BERT-based backbone [ 24] is widely applied\nin retrieval models. One common retriever design is to construct\ntwo-stream encoders with BERT structure (one encoder for the\nquery and the other for the documents), which is also called bi-\nencoder [ 128,156]. Early-stage RAG methods tend to freeze [ 6,111]\nor partially freeze [ 69] the parameters of the retriever to perform\ngeneral-level relevant knowledge extraction and pay more atten-\ntion to the knowledge leveraging and generator fine-tuning. Large-\nscale specialized pre-training further enhances RAG models to\nexcel in more knowledge-intensive tasks. One typical success is\nDense Passage Retriever (DPR) [ 56], which uses a BERT-based\nbackbone and is pre-trained specifically for the OpenQA task with\nquestion-answer pair data. DPR has shown strong capacity as a\npre-trained retriever, facilitating many RAG models to succeed in\nvarious downstream tasks [ 49,69,128,131,133]. It has also been\nregarded as the first step in the RAG paradigm for improving the\nperformance of LLMs, which may further enhance the alignment of\nthe embeddings between queries and relevant textual data through\nfine-tuning [ 16]. A recent study [ 116] has also discovered that DPR\ntraining decentralizes how knowledge is stored in the network,\ncreating multiple access pathways to the same information. With\neffective fine-tuning, bi-encoder retrievers are also applied widely\nin ICL-based RAG [ 76,87,95,105,120,167]. Specifically, they have\nbeen more often used for sentence embedding similarity-based\nretrieval, as well as for some special requirement in ICL, such as\ndiverse example retrieval [167].\nAnother stream of widely applied dense retrievers in RA-LLMs\nhas one-encoder structures, which may be based on Transformer,\nBERT or other off-the-shelf sequence modeling backbones.

The retrieved documents are further\nleveraged in generation with the augmentation module, which may have different designs based on the integration stage in the\ngeneration model.\nDatabaseQuery\nChunking/\nTokenizing/\n...\u00a0\u00a0\nIndexing\u00a0\u00a0Dense Retrieval\nEmbedding\u00a0\nSparse Retrieval\nRelevance Scoring\u00a0\nRelevance Scoring\u00a0Retrieved Results\n(Chunks/ Documents/\nTokens /Entities/ ..)\nFigure 3: Illustration of the retriever in RA-LLMs, which can\nbe implemented in either dense or sparse manners, each with\nseveral key operations.\none-encoder retrievers are generally pre-trained on large-scale un-\naligned documents by contrastive learning [ 116], which may there-\nfore excel for their versatility, meaning that they can transfer and\ngeneralize better to new domains or tasks. Such general-purpose\npre-trained retrievers, e.g., Contriever [ 38] and Spider [ 112], would\nbe more flexible to use in LLMs targeting on various tasks and have\ndemonstrated their effectiveness in many RA-LLM methods, such as\nIn-Context RALM [ 111], Atlas [ 50], Self-RAG [ 5], and others [ 128].\nAccording to experimental results in existing studies [ 173], for open-\ndomain QA tasks, when cooperated with InstructGPT [ 101], ap-\nplying general-purpose pre-trained retriever (Contriever) without\nfine-tuning achieves comparable performance to sparse retriever\n(BM25). However, they are both worse than the DPR model fine-\ntuned on target datasets, showing the effectiveness of fine-tuning\non targeted tasks and data.3.1.2 Retrieval Granularity. Retrieval granularity denotes the re-\ntrieval unit in which the corpus is indexed, e.g., document, passage,\ntoken, or other levels like entity. For RAG, the choice of retrieval\ngranularity can significantly impact the overall performance of the\nmodel in terms of effectiveness and efficiency as they determine\nthe saving space for the database as well as the computational cost\nfor searching [ 4]. Early stage retrieval-augmented language mod-\nels [10] propose to retrieve whole pieces of documents, and then\napply a machine comprehension model trained to detect answer\nspans in the returned documents, which focuses more on language\nreading and key information locating in the document. In gener-\native language models, Chunk retrieval (also called passages in\nsome references [ 42,52,56]) is common, which has been used in\nboth traditional and LLM-based RAG models such as REALM [ 42],\nRAG [ 69] and Atlas [ 50]. A more fine-grained retrieval, i.e., token\nretrieval , instead can be done with faster searching but will bring\nmore burden for the database saving. token retrieval is more suit-\nable in cases requiring rare patterns or out-of-domain data [ 57],\nmeanwhile cooperates well with the every-token retrieval strat-\negy as applied in kNN-LM and other similar work [ 43,98,171]. In\ncomparison, a text chunk may contain compact and complete infor-\nmation with less redundancy and irrelevancy, therefore becoming\nthe mainstream retrieval text granularity in RAG.\nAnother major retrieval granularity proposed in RAG is entity\nretrieval . Unlike the above types of granularity, entity retrieval is\ndesigned from the perspective of knowledge rather than language.\nF\u00e9vry et al . [35] introduce the Entities as Experts (E AE) model,\nwhich divides the parameter space of language models according\nto the entity identity. The proposed E AE model aims to learn entity\nrepresentations from the text along with other model parameters\n4\nA Survey on RAG Meets LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nwith the Wikipedia database and represent knowledge with entity\nmemory. At a more fine-grained level, de Jong et al . [22] propose to\nbuild the knowledge base by learning and retrieving mention rather\nthan entity. Overall, applying entity or mention-level retrieval in\nRAG would be more effective for entity-centric tasks, and more\nefficient in space compared to token-wise retrieval.\n3.1.3 Pre-retrieval and Post-retrieval Enhancement. To ensure the\nretrieval quality, i.e., increase the accuracy and relevance of the re-\ntrieved results, various pre- and post-retrieval strategies have been\nproposed to further enhance the input and output of the retriever.\nWang et al . [148] propose a query expansion approach Query2doc,\nwhich generates pseudo-documents by few-shot prompting LLMs\nand expands the query with the relevant information in pseudo-\ndocuments, which can aid in query disambiguation and guide\nthe retrievers. They have empirically demonstrated that such a\nmethod can boost the performance of both the sparse and dense\nretriever [ 56] on ad-hoc information retrieval datasets. Similarly,\nGao et al . [36] propose Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)\nmethod, which instructs an LLM to generate hypothetical docu-\nments for the given query. The hypothetical documents are then\nused as new queries to get embedded and search for neighbors with\nthe dense retriever.\nAnother pre-retrieval strategy, query rewrite [92], aims to close\nthe gaps between the input text and the needed knowledge in\nretrieval, to reformulate the original question into a more conducive\nversion to retrieve. Specifically, Ma et al . [92] propose the Rewrite-\nRetrieve-Read framework, which prompts an LLM to generate the\nquery for the retrieval function. The motivation of the rewriting\nstep is to clarify the retrieval need in the new query to ease the\nburden on the retrieval function to comprehend the input and\nenhance the output, i.e., retrieved relevant information. They have\ntested both the settings of using a frozen LLM and a trainable model\nto be the rewriter, both outperforming naive RAG or generation\nmodels, demonstrating diverse performance on different tested QA\ndatasets though.\nYu et al . [174] propose query augmentation to combine the\noriginal query and the preliminary generated outputs as a new\nquery, which is further used to retrieve relevant information from\nthe external database. The retrieved results can inspire the language\nmodel to rethink the generated results and enhance them. Com-\npared to applying only the original query, such augmentation may\ncontribute more relevant information retrieved from the corpus for\nthe directly clarification of query-output relationships. Including\ninitial output in the new query further enhances the lexical and\nsemantic overlap between the supporting documents to be retrieved\nwith the given question. Query augmentation achieves overall bet-\nter performance among these query enhancement strategies since it\nmay process all retrieved knowledge collectively while generating\nanswers [147].\nPost-retrieval enhancement denotes the procedure to process\nthe extracted top-k documents from the retriever before feeding\nthem to the generator for the sake of better alignment between the\nretrieval and generation stages [ 164], particularly for closed-source\ngenerators such as LLMs. For example, Yang et al . [164] propose\nthe Pluggable Reward-driven Context Adapter (PRCA) that enables\nto fine-tune the lightweight adapter instead of the generator onspecific datasets. It also distills the retrieved documents through re-\ninforcement learning with the rewards resulting from the generator.\nGlass et al . [40] propose Retrieve-Rerank-Generate (R2G) method,\nwhich assembles the retrieved documents of different retrieval ap-\nproaches with the rerank operation to boost the robustness of the\nretrieval results. Another consideration for applying post-retrieval\nenhancement is that the retrieved information may sometimes be ir-\nrelevant or contain noise, which might not help with the generation\nmodel for the task, or even worse, harm the generation process [ 151].\nWang et al . [151] , Asai et al . [5], Yu et al . [174] propose different\nstrategies to mitigate the noise in retrieved knowledge documents.\nHowever, Xiong et al . [158] empirically studied that these methods\nare dependent on the LLM\u2019s confidence levels, which might not\nbe as precise as expected. For this problem, Wang et al . [147] pro-\npose BlendFilter, which simultaneously considers the pre-retrieval\nquery generation blending and the post-retrieval knowledge filter-\ning. This method can tackle the complex questions as well as the\nnoisy retrieved knowledge problems, therefore comprehensively\nenhancing the RA-LLM performance.\nMore recently, advanced RAG pipelines have been proposed\nusing LLMs to generate reasoning paths and plans with the Infor-\nmation Retrieval (IR) module to iteratively retrieve knowledge to\nenhance LLM-based generation [ 124,163,166]. However, Zhu et al .\n[190] point out that if the outputs of IR and LLM are low-quality,\nthe retrieval and generation processes will get hindered by each\nother with such an iterative guidance pipeline. To overcome this\nbarrier, they propose a new reasoning approach for query and re-\ntrieved knowledge enhancement. Post-retrieval strategies may also\nfunction to enhance the compatibility between the retrieved results\nand the generation models. For example, one of the main limitations\nof existing LLMs is the length of the input tokens, which prevents\nlong retrieved documents being directly incorporated into exist-\ning RA-LLMs. For this limitation, Xu et al . [160] propose Retrieve,\nCompress, Prepend (RECOMP), which adds an intermediate step\nto process the retrieved documents into a textual summary before\nin-context augmentation in the generation process.\n3.1.4 Database. Retrieval in RAG is conducted based on external\nknowledge source, which can be a closed- or open-sourced [ 92,\n94], as illustrated in Figure 2. Closed-sourced database generally\nstores key-value pairs for knowledge, which can be constructed in\nvarious ways. The keys are primarily used for similarity matching,\nbeing as sparse vectors such as in BM25 or dense embeddings\nfrom the retrieval encoding. The value depends on the specific\nretrieval target, which is raw text in most cases [ 6,42,49,67,69,\n123]. For example, each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-\nword chunks, to make a total of 21M documents in early RAG [ 69].\nEach document is encoded by a dense embedding and saved in the\ndatabase as the value and key, respectively. The value can store\ntokens too, one for each as applied in kNN-LM and Spalm [ 57,171].\nThe source of the database depends on the specific application\ndomains and tasks. Wikipedia is one of the most commonly applied\ngeneral retrieval sets in previous RAG work, which stores factual\nstructured information and has several versions differing in scale,\nfrom billion token-level [ 22,35,42,57,69,111,128,160,171] to\ntrillion token-level [ 6]. Domain-specific database is also used for\ndownstream tasks. For example, for the code generation task, Zan\n5\nConference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYujuan Ding1, Wenqi Fan1\u2217, Liangbo Ning1, Shijie Wang1, Hengyun Li1,\nDawei Yin2, Tat-Seng Chua3, and Qing Li1\net al. [176] collect API information and code files of public libraries\nto build their APIretriever database. In addition, Zhou et al [ 189]\npropose to use a documentation pool frequently updated with new\ncontent (newly released libraries) in their model.\nApplying Internet searching engine [ 89] such as Bing and Google\navoids the maintenance of the search index and can access up-to-\ndate knowledge [ 65]. Meanwhile, it provides a broader knowledge\nbase than the closed-sourced database [ 5,65]. Internet search has\nbeen widely incorporated with black-box LLMs and shows effective-\nness for different functions such as knowledge augmentation [ 65],\nfact-checking [ 94] and LLM agent enhancement [ 166]. Compared\nto traditional RAG, Internet search has been leveraged more as\nthe retriever in RA-LLMs owing to the extraordinary capability of\nLLMs to be the Reader to comprehend the searching results, i.e., the\nretrieved documents, as well as LLMs\u2019 ability to use tools to process\nand analyze the them [ 92]. Existing studies [ 173] have shown that\nleveraging search engines (e.g., InstrucGPT) is particularly effective\nfor LLMs on zero-shot knowledge-intensive tasks such as OpenQA\nand fact checking.\n3.2 Generation\nThe design of the generator heavily depends on the downstream\ntasks. For most text generation tasks, Decoder-only and Encoder-\nDecoder are two dominant structures [ 186]. The recent develop-\nment of commercial closed-sourced large foundation models makes\nblack-box generation models mainstream in RA-LLMs. In this part,\nwe will briefly review studies with these two types of genera-\ntors: parameter-accessible (white-box) and parameter-inaccessible\n(black-box).\n3.2.1 Parameter-Accessible Generators (White-box). The structure\nofEncoder-Decoder processes the input and the target independently\nwith different sets of parameters, in which a cross-attention compo-\nnent is developed to connect input tokens to target tokens. Repre-\nsentative Encoder-Decoder models include T5 [ 110] and BART [ 68].\nIn comparison, Decoder-only models process inputs and targets after\nconcatenation, which makes the representations of the two parts\nconcurrently built layer-by-layer as they propagate up the network.\nThese two types of generators are widely applied in existing RAG\nwork. For example, RAG [ 69] and Re2G [40] employ BART; FID [ 49]\nand EMDR2utilize T5. There are other models [ 6,78] leveraging\nTransformer-based Encoder-Decoder architecture but with some\ncustomized design. Generators in RAG differ themselves from gen-\neral ones by incorporating retrieved data to enhance the generation\naccuracy and relevance. Furthermore, white-box generators allow\nparameter optimization, which can be trained to adapt to different\nretrieval and augmentation approaches for a better performance of\ngeneration.\n3.2.2 Parameter-Inaccessible Generators (Black-box). A certain pro-\nportion of LLMs are released without the disclosure of internal\nstructures or the accessibility of parameters, especially those par-\nticularly large-scale ones such as GPT series [ 1], Codex [ 12] and\nClaude, which are called black-box generation models. These gen-\nerators only allow the operations of feeding queries (input) and re-\nceiving responses (output) while not allowing the internal structureto be altered or parameters to be updated. From another perspec-\ntive, LLMs, even those open for fine-tuning, are large in scale and\ndifficult to tune for downstream domain-specific tasks with only a\nlimited amount of data. Black-box RA-LLMs, therefore, focus more\non the retrieval and augmentation processes, trying to enhance\nthe generator by augmenting the input (also called prompt in the\ncontext of LLMs) with better knowledge, guidance, or examples for\nthe generation. For example, Rubin et al . [120] proposes to train a\nprompt retriever with the data labeled by language models them-\nselves, which can be used to provide better examples for in-context\nlearning, therefore enhancing the final generation performance. Xu\net al. [160] propose to compress the retrieved documents before\nin-context integration, which can reduce the computational costs\nand also relieve the burden of LMs to identify relevant information\nin long retrieved documents.\n3.3 Retrieval Integration for Generation\nAugmentation\nAugmentation describes the technical process that integrates re-\ntrieval and generation parts, which is the essential part of RA-LLMs.\nIn this subsection, we introduce three main designs of augmenta-\ntion, which are conducted at the input, output, and intermediate\nlayers of generator respectively, as illustrated in Figure 2.\n3.3.1 Input-Layer Integration. A common way to integrate retrieved\ninformation/documents is to combine them with the original in-\nput/query and jointly pass them to the generator, which is called\ninput-layer integration. For example, In-Context RALM [ 111] ap-\nplies input-layer integration by specifically concatenating the origi-\nnal input and all retrieved documents into a single sequence as the\nnew input for the generation model. Despite the effectiveness, such\nintegration is limited to the number of retrieved documents, since\nthe concatenated new input may be too long to be processed by\nthe generation model. In-context RALM specifically alleviates this\nlimitation by removing tokens from the beginning of the new in-\nput. To avoid information loss with such a token removing strategy,\nFID [ 49] employs a different integration method that processes each\nretrieved document independently in the encoder. This strategy\nis scalable to a large number of contexts as it only performs self-\nattention over one context at a time in the follow-up processing.\nAtlas [ 50] and R EPLUG [128] apply a similar parallel integration\nby concatenating the query and one retrieved document at a time.\nIn general, most black-box generation-based RAG methods apply\ninput-layer integration since neither the intermediate layer of the\ngeneration model or the output distribution is accessible.\nMore specially for LLMs, input-layer integration may use the\nretrieved content as (additional) prompts or demonstrations on top\nof using it as supplementary to the original input as in traditional\nRAGs [ 120]. Prompt retrieval aims to find suitable natural language\nprompts automatically through retrieval to teach the LLM to learn\nin context [ 7] or to induce the LLM to reason[ 154]. It may boost\nthe zero-shot ability of LLMs without delicate prompt engineering.\nFor example, Cheng et al . [16] propose to learn a prompt retriever\nbased on the input-prompt pair data with score labels resulting\nfrom a frozen LLM.\n6\nA Survey on RAG Meets LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\n3.3.2 Output-Layer Integration. Another kind of augmentation is\npost-hoc, i.e., output-layer integration, which joints retrieval and\ngeneration results. For example, kNN-LM [ 57] interpolates two\nnext-token distributions in prediction: one induced by the LM and\nthe other induced by the nearest neighbors from the retrieval cor-\npus. Output-layer linear integration [ 41,188] is flexible to apply\nsince it can be plugged into most generation models without addi-\ntional training. However, the simplicity of output-layer integration\nalso limits the model\u2019s ability to reason about the retrieved text.\nTo tackle this limitation, Yogatama et al . [171] propose to add an\nextra gating network to post-process the retrieved data and achieve\ncomparatively better performance. For LLMs, output-layer inte-\ngration is as reasonable and adaptive as input-layer integration.\nREFEED[174] proposes an answer refining mechanism that applies\nan LLM to evaluate the retrieved information and adjust the initial\nanswer accordingly to enhance the accuracy of the response. Sim-\nilarly, Zhang et al . [182] propose the COMBO framework, which\nmatches LLM-generated passages with retrieved counterparts into\ncompatible pairs based on pre-trained discriminators. The passage\npairs are then handled by a Fusion-in-Decoder-based [ 49] to derive\na final answer.\n3.3.3 Intermediate-Layer Integration. Compared to the above two\nnon-parametric approaches, a more engaging augmentation is to\ndesign a semi-parametric module to integrate the retrieved results\nthrough the internal layers of the generation model, which is called\nintermediate-layer integration. Such integration might add addi-\ntional complexity and is promising to enhance the capability of the\ngeneration model with effective training. Typically, a Transformer\nmodule is introduced to leverage retrieved information (mostly\nencoded into dense representations) into the generation model to\ninteract with the representations in the middle stage of the genera-\ntion. For example, R ETRO [6] introduces a Chunked Cross Attention\n(CCA) layer to process the retrieved chunks in the generator blocks,\nand Wu et al . [157] introduces the kNN-Augmented Attention Layer.\nSimilarly, E AE [35] and TOME [22] use Entity Memory and Mem-\noryAttention layer to incorporate the retrieved Entity and Entity\nMentions, respectively. Such intermediate-layer integration can\nuse many blocks frequently and efficiently to enhance the capa-\nbility of the whole RAG model. It offers an efficient alternative to\nincorporate a large number of text chunks frequently retrieved,\nwhich are challenging to process with input-layer integration due\nto the input length limit of LMs [ 6]. However, it also needs to be\nnoted that intermediate-layer integration requires high access to\nthe generation models, which is not feasible for most LLMs that\nare accessible through inference APIs [92].\n3.4 Retrieval Augmentation Necessity and\nFrequency\nThe retrieval operation in LLM-based generation generally aims to\nsupplement knowledge to enhance generation. Although retrieval-\naugmented models have emerged promising, they have been criti-\ncized for not being a universal solution [ 70,103] as indiscriminately\naugmenting LLMs with irrelevant passages can override poten-\ntially correct knowledge already possessed by LLMs and result in\nincorrect responses instead [ 93]. Thakur et al . [139] contribute a\nhuman-annotated dataset to help evaluate the robustness of LLMsagainst errors in external retrieved knowledge and observe that\nLLMs may double the hallucination rate on the non-relevant re-\ntrieved passages than on the relevant ones. Therefore, it is critical\nfor RA-LLMs to accurately recall the prior knowledge while selec-\ntively incorporating retrieved information only when necessary,\nwhich is the path to robust RA-LLMs.\nMost existing methods determine the necessity of retrieval based\non the preliminary answers of LLMs or their internal reasoning re-\nsults [ 96,111]. For example, Self-RAG [ 5] introduces special tokens\nto assess the necessity of retrieval and control retrieval behavior.\nOther methods design iterative prompts to decide if extra informa-\ntion is required during generation, which thereby needs to invoke\nretrieval or other actions for LLMs [ 154,166]. In traditional RAGs,\nretrieval necessity judgment has also been explored and proposed\nto address by intuitive approaches such as assessing the confidence\nof the logits produced by the generation models [ 43,51,54]. Such a\nsolution is also applicable to RA-LLMs, for example, FLARE [ 52] dy-\nnamically triggers RAG if logits are lower than a specific threshold.\nMore flexibly, Tan et al . [138] introduces SlimPLM, a collabora-\ntive approach that detects missing knowledge in LLMs with a slim\nproxy model, which functions to generate a \u201cheuristic answer\u201d. The\n\u201cheuristic answer\u201d is used to assess the necessity of retrieval and\nfacilitate the retrieval process if necessary by being applied in query\nrewriting.\nIn traditional RAGs that rarely consider retrieval necessity, re-\ntrieval frequency (also called retrieval stride) is an important design\naspect to determine the degree of using the retrieval in the gen-\neration, thereby greatly affecting the overall performance of RAG\nmodels [ 111]. Retrieval frequency controls how much to rely on the\nretrieval results, thereby affecting both the efficiency and effective-\nness of the model. When the necessity of retrieval is not considered,\nretrieval frequency is often pre-defined and fixed, which have three\ncommon settings: one-time, every-n-token, and every-token. One-\ntime retrieval invokes the retrieval function only once and tries to\nfind all desired information in that one-time operation. One-time\nretrieval is usually operated at the beginning of the generation pro-\ncess, and then provides all retrieved documents to the generation\nmodels along with the original input, as applied in REALM [ 42].\nOne-time retrieval is more suitable for the cases that the informa-\ntion needs in external databases are obvious to LLMs [ 52]. However,\nfor language tasks requiring long-form output such as open-domain\nsummarization, the dependency among the tokens in the output is\nmore important to be considered during the generation. In these\ncases, pre-retrieved documents (through one-time retrieval) might\nnot be enough to support the generation of the whole sequence of\noutput, which calls for in-generation retrieval operations. To this\nend, In-Context RALM [ 111] and RETRO [ 6] apply every-n-token\nretrieval in the process of generation for better augmentation. In\ncomparison, kNN-LM [ 57] adopts a more frequent retrieval strat-\negy, which retrieves information for the prediction of every token\nduring the generation. Overall, applying different frequencies of re-\ntrieval can impact both the effectiveness and efficiency of the whole\nRAG method. For example, more frequent retrieval leads to better\nperformance but also increases the computing cost [ 111]. Choosing\nretrieval frequency is almost a trade-off between computing cost\nand performance.\n7\nConference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYujuan Ding1, Wenqi Fan1\u2217, Liangbo Ning1, Shijie Wang1, Hengyun Li1,\nDawei Yin2, Tat-Seng Chua3, and Qing Li1\n4 RA-LLMS TRAINING\nBased on whether training is required or not, existing RAG methods\ncan be categorized into two main classes: train-free approaches\nandtraining-based approaches. Training-free methods usually\ndirectly leverage the retrieved knowledge during inference time\nwithout introducing extra training by inserting the retrieved text\ninto the prompt, which is computationally efficient. However, one\npotential challenge is that the retriever and generator components\nare not specifically optimized for downstream tasks, which could\neasily lead to sub-optimal utilization of the retrieved knowledge.\nTo fully exploit the external knowledge, extensive methods are\nproposed to fine-tune the retriever and generator, thereby guiding\nlarge language models to effectively adapt and integrate retrieved\ninformation [121, 122, 124, 128, 145, 191].\nAccording to the training strategies, we categorize these training-\nbased approaches into three classes: 1) Independent Training\napproaches independently train each component in the RAG proce-\ndure, 2) Sequential Training methods train one module first and\nfreeze the well-trained component to guide the tuning process of\nthe other part, and 3) Joint Training approaches train retriever\nand generator simultaneously. In the following section, we will\ncomprehensively review the training-free, independent training,\nsequential training, and joint training methods. The comparison of\nthese different training methods is depicted in Figure 4.\n4.1 Training-free\nWith the huge number of parameters, LLMs have exhibited human-\nlevel intelligence and achieved promising prediction performance\non various downstream tasks. However, it is extremely challenging\nto frequently perform fine-tuning and update the knowledge stored\nin the model parameters [ 69] due to the considerable time and\ncomputational resources required. Recently, numerous studies have\nsuggested enhancing LLMs with retrieval mechanisms, enabling\nthem to dynamically acquire new knowledge from external sources\nwithout extra training processes (i.e., training-free ) [49,52,58], in-\nstead of relying solely on the implicit knowledge encoded in the\nmodel\u2019s parameters. These approaches have shown significant per-\nformance improvement for various knowledge-intensive tasks, such\nas open-domain question answering [ 69] and document summariza-\ntion [ 134]. According to the different ways in which LLMs utilize\nretrieved information, we categorize these training-free methods\ninto two categories: 1) Prompt Engineering-based Methods\nintegrate retrieved knowledge into the original prompt directly,\nand 2) Retrieval-Guided Token Generation Methods retrieve\ninformation to calibrate the token generation process.\n4.1.1 Prompt Engineering-based Methods. As the LLMs\u2019 generation\nperformance highly depends on the input query, numerous training-\nfree RAG approaches employ external knowledge by refining the\noriginal prompts [ 52,58,75]. Specifically, the retrieved texts are usu-\nally used as contextual information and combined with the original\nprompt to guide the generation of LLMs [ 49,52,58,60,75,106,150].\nFor example, In-Context RALM [ 111] keeps the LLM parameters\nunchanged and directly incorporates the retrieved document before\nthe original prompt to augment the generation process. IRCoT [ 141]\ninterleaves chain-of-thought (CoT) generation and knowledge re-\ntrieval steps, enabling the retrieval of more relevant information forsubsequent reasoning steps compared to standard retrieval methods\nthat rely solely on the question as the query. Instead of retrieving\nknowledge from a large corpus, GENREAD [ 173] first prompts a\nLLM to generate contextual documents based on the query, and\nthen generate answers based on the given context and question.\nSKR [ 151] proposes guiding LLMs to determine whether they can\nanswer a given question based on their internal knowledge, en-\nabling flexible utilization of both internal and external knowledge\nby selectively calling the retriever. TOC [ 60] first retrieves relevant\nknowledge for ambiguous questions and recursively constructs\na tree structure by clarifying ambiguous questions into multiple\ndisambiguate questions, which is further aggregated to generate\nlong-form answers.\n4.1.2 Retrieval-Guided Token Generation Methods. In addition to\ndirectly integrating external knowledge into the original prompt,\nthe auxiliary information can be employed to adjust the token gen-\neration process. For example, KNN-KMs [ 57] first retrieves \ud835\udc58most\nrelevant contexts from the datastore based on the given query, and\ncomputes a neighbor distribution based on the distance. The output\ndistribution is calibrated by interpolating the neighbor distribution\nand the original model\u2019s output distribution. Rest [ 45] is proposed\nto replace the parametric draft model with a non-parametric re-\ntrieval datastore and retrieves relevant tokens based on the current\ncontext for speculative decoding [9, 66, 137].\n4.2 Independent Training\nIndependent training refers to training the retriever and LLMs as\ntwo entirely independent processes, in which there is no interac-\ntion between the retriever and the LLMs during the training pro-\ncess [ 56,64,189]. Compared with training-free methods, the perfor-\nmance of the RAG-empowered models can be effectively enhanced\nby training LLMs to leverage the retrieved knowledge or retrievers\nto bridge the gap between information retrieval and language gen-\neration. For the training of LLMs, the negative loglikelihood loss is\nthe most representative training objective [ 109,140], which aims\nto guide the LLMs to generate desired output based on the given\ninput. Regarding the retriever, it can be categorized into two types:\n1) Sparse retriever [ 114,119], and 2) Dense retriever [ 56,64,189].\nThe sparse retrievers usually exploit sparse features, e.g., word fre-\nquencies, to represent the documents and calculate the relevance\nscores based on task-specific metrics [ 72,114,119] such as TF-IDF\nand BM25. As for the dense retrievers, deep neural networks are\nemployed to encode the query and documents into dense repre-\nsentations, and then the inner product is usually used to calculate\nrelevance scores and retrieve the relevant external knowledge. For\nexample, DPR [ 56] adopts two independent BERT [ 24] networks\nto encode the query and passages respectively, and trains these\nmodels by utilizing contrastive learning. CoG [ 64] proposes to train\na prefix encoder and a phrase encoder for retrieval and reformulate\nthe text generation as multiple copy-and-paste operations from\nexisting source text collection.\n4.3 Sequential Training\nIndependent training is an efficient approach to exploit the exter-\nnal knowledge during the generation process since the retriever\nand generator can be trained offline and any off-the-shelf models\n8\nA Survey on RAG Meets LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nRetriever\u00a0 Datastore\u00a0\nInput OutputDatastore\u00a0 Retriever\u00a0\nInput OutputRetriever\u00a0 Datastore\u00a0\nInput Output\nRetriever\u00a0 Datastore\u00a0Input Output\nRetriever\u00a0 Datastore\u00a0\nInput OutputRetriever\u00a0 Datastore\u00a0\nInput Output1.

Existing RA-\nLLMs approaches can be categorized into two classes: training-free approaches usually directly leverage retrieved information\nduring the inference time by integrating the retrieved knowledge into the prompt, and training-based approaches fine-tune the\nretrieval and generator to enhance the generation performance. Based on the training strategies, training-based methods can\nbe further categorized into three groups: independent training, where the retrieval and generator components are trained\nindependently; sequential training, where they are trained sequentially; and joint training, where they are trained jointly.\ncan be utilized, avoiding extra training costs. To better enhance\nthe synergy between the retriever and generator, several methods\nhave been proposed to train the retriever and LLMs sequentially.\nIn these sequential training methods, the process typically begins\nwith the independent pre-training of either the retriever or the\ngenerator, after which the pre-trained module is fixed while the\nother module undergoes training. Note that various existing mod-\nels (e.g., BERT [ 24,59,117], CLIP [ 107], T5 [ 110]) can be directly\nemployed as the fixed retriever and generator, thereby bypassing\nthe first pertaining process. Compared to independent training,\nsequential training involves coordinated training of the retriever\nand generator, where the trainable module benefits from the assis-\ntance of the fixed module. Based on the training order between the\nretriever and generator, sequential training can be categorized into\ntwo classes: 1) Retriever First [5,121,122,145,191], and 2) LLMs\nFirst [124, 128, 149].\n4.3.1 Retriever First. These methods first train the retrieval model\nand then fix it. LLMs are then trained by utilizing the retrieved\nknowledge. For instance, RETRO [ 6] adopts the BERT model that is\npre-trained independently as the retriever, and an encoder-decoder\narchitecture is trained to integrate retrieval chunks into the model\u2019spredictions. RALMs [ 172] adopts Google Search and the open-\nsource COLBERTV2 [ 59] as the pre-trained retriever and fine-\ntunes the LLM to effectively leverage the retrieved passages. ITER-\nRTGEN [ 118] utilizes the pre-trained S-BERT [ 117] as the retriever\nand introduces an adaptive hybrid retrieval strategy for retrieving\ndemonstrations. Additionally, it leverages T5 [ 110] as the generator,\nwhich undergoes further fine-tuning based on the target label and\ninput combining the original prompt with retrieved demonstrations.\nSMALLCAP [ 115] proposes using the CLIP [ 107], which is a pow-\nerful pre-trained multi-modal network, to encode the input image\nand the textual data of the external datastore and retrieve the most\nrelevant items based on the cosine similarity. A cross-attention\nlayer is trained and GPT-2 [ 109] is used as the decoder to produce\ncaptions.\n4.3.2 LLMs First. Similarly, it can also pre-train LLMs first, and\nthen tune the retriever under the supervision of the well-trained\nLLMs. For example, DKRR [ 48] shows that attention scores from a\nsequence-to-sequence model can indicate the document\u2019s relevance.\nTherefore, they propose to leverage the attention scores of a reader\nmodel to produce synthetic labels to train the retriever. AAR [ 175]\nproposes using a small language model to generate the supervised\nsignal for training retrievers. The well-trained retriever can be\n9\nConference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYujuan Ding1, Wenqi Fan1\u2217, Liangbo Ning1, Shijie Wang1, Hengyun Li1,\nDawei Yin2, Tat-Seng Chua3, and Qing Li1\nApplications\nNLP Applications\nQA Systems ChatBots Fact VerificationDownstream\nTasks\nRecommendationsSoftware\nEngineeringDomain-specific\nApplications\nAI for Science Finance\nRETRO [6]\nFusion-in-Decoder [49]\nREALM [42], etc.Ghazvininejad et al .\n[39]\nKDBTS [14]\nKomeili et al.

A frozen LLM is employed\nto guide the fine-tuning process of the prompt retriever, and this\nretriever then retrieves prompts for different tasks with various\nLLMs during inference.\n4.4 Joint Training\nJoint training methods [ 17,46,55,74,159,188] employ the end-to-\nend paradigm to optimize the retriever and generator simultane-\nously. Instead of training each module sequentially, joint training\nmethods effectively enhance the retriever\u2019s ability to locate external\nknowledge for generation and the generator\u2019s capacity to effectively\nleverage the retrieved information. For instance, RAG [ 69] mini-\nmizes the negative loglikelihood to jointly train the retriever and\ngenerator. REALM [ 42] adopts a similar training paradigm to that\nof RAG [ 69], and Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) [ 15,27,\n113,125] technique is used to locate the most relevant documents.\nTo employ MIPS, all external documents are embedded first and a\nsearch index is produced for each embedding. An asynchronous\nindex updating strategy [ 42,47,50,133] is proposed to refresh the\nindex every several hundred training steps to avoid time consump-\ntion of re-indexing all documents.\n5 APPLICATIONS\nIn this section, we will introduce some representative applications\nof retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-LLMs). To pro-\nvide a clear overview of the applications of RA-LLMs, we will review\nthem from three perspectives: NLP applications ,downstream tasks ,and domain-specific applications . The studies mentioned in this\nsection are summarized and categorized in Figure 5.\n5.1 NLP Applications\nDue to the intrinsic capability in text generation, RA-LLMs have\nvarious applications in the NLP field, such as Question Answer\n(QA) Systems, ChatBot, and Fact Verification.\n5.1.1 QA Systems. QA Systems aim to provide precise answers\nto user\u2019s queries. However, even when trained on extensive data,\nthese systems may lack the latest information or specific domain\nknowledge that is not included in their training data [ 49,85]. To\naddress this limitation, the integration of RA-LLMs has played a cru-\ncial role in advancing the capabilities of QA systems by enhancing\ntheir ability to retrieve and synthesize relevant information [ 6,49].\nSpecifically, RA-LLMs can provide coherent and contextually rele-\nvant answers by leveraging their retrieval component to access a\nvast knowledge base. For example, REALM [ 42] integrates a knowl-\nedge retriever that can retrieve information from a large corpus\nduring pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference. This approach al-\nlows REALM to effectively retrieve from a vast knowledge corpus,\nthereby improving the accuracy of its responses. Similarly, Fusion-\nin-Decoder [ 49] retrieves passages from support documents and\nthen fuses them with questions to generate the answer, achieving\nhigher accuracy. In addition, Borgeaud et al . [6] indicate that the\nquality of the answers may rely more on the output of the retrieval\nencoder.\n5.1.2 ChatBot. ChatBot is designed to interact with users in a\nnatural and conversational manner [ 81]. Different from the QA\nsystem, ChatBot focuses on maintaining a coherent and contextu-\nally rich conversation with the user. To enhance these capabilities,\nrecent methods focus on integrating RA-LLMs [ 55,63,179] for its\nability to augment the ChatBot with relevant external knowledge,\n10\nA Survey on RAG Meets LLMs: Towards Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models Conference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USA\nfacilitating more engaging and context-rich interactions with users.\nFor example, some studies [ 14,39] retrieve relevant knowledge\nfrom static databases (e.g., a Wikipedia dump) to augment conver-\nsation. Komeili et al . [63] propose retrieving information from the\ninternet search to further augment conversation performance. Con-\nsidering the dynamic nature of knowledge in the world, another\nmodel [ 144] further accesses large amounts of dynamic information\nin search engines to generate responses.\n5.1.3 Fact Verification. Fact Verification is a critical task in veri-\nfying the accuracy and reliability of information. With the need\nfor trusted evidence, RA-LLMs are being utilized to enhance the\ncapabilities of fact verification [ 50,69,69]. Lewis et al . [69] first\npropose retrieval of external knowledge to augment a range of\nknowledge-intensive tasks including fact verification. On the other\nhand, Atlas [ 50] examines the performance of the RA-LLMs for fact\nverification under few-shot learning. Recently, Self-RAG [ 5] has\ngreatly made a notable impression by incorporating a self-reflective\nmechanism. Specifically, Self-RAG reflects on whether retrieved\ninformation is helpful and judges the reliability of retrieved infor-\nmation, thereby greatly improving the verification accuracy.\n5.2 Downstream Tasks\nIn addition to NLP applications, RA-LLMs can also be applied to\nvarious downstream tasks, such as recommendations and software\nengineering.\n5.2.1 Recommendations. Recommender systems play an impor-\ntant role in modeling users\u2019 preferences and providing personalized\nrecommendations [ 30\u201332,146,180,187]. Recently, RA-LLMs have\ndemonstrated great potential in providing personalized and con-\ntextually relevant recommendations by integrating retrieval and\ngeneration processes [ 25,88,155]. For example, Di Palma [25] pro-\nposes a simple retrieval-augmented recommendation model, that\nleverages knowledge from movie or book datasets to enhance rec-\nommendations. Additionally, Lu et al . [88] further retrieval from\nthe reviews to enrich item information in recommender systems.\nCoRAL [ 155] utilizes reinforcement learning to retrieve collabo-\nrative information from the dataset and align it with semantic\ninformation for more accurate recommendations.\n5.2.2 Software Engineering. The rise of RA-LLMs has influenced\nmany aspects of software engineering [ 99,168,189]. For example,\nsome studies propose the retrieval-augmented generation paradigm\nfor code generation [ 189] and program repair [ 99]. Similarly, Parvez\net al. [102] retrieve top-ranked codes or summaries from the code-\nbase and aggregate them with input to enhance code generation and\nsummarization. In addition, RA-LLMs show potential in tabular data\nprocessing [71, 168] and Text-to-SQL semantic parsing [105, 127].\n5.3 Domain-specific Applications\nRA-LLMs have been widely adopted for various domain-specific\ntasks, such as AI for Science and Finance.\n5.3.1 AI for Science. RA-LLMs have proven to be beneficial for\nthe realms of science, such as molecular and protein. Molecules\ninclude identifying the molecule\u2019s property and predicting newmolecules, thereby favoring drug discovery. Currently, some RA-\nLLMs have been applied to molecules by integrating retrieval of\nmolecule structure and biomedical entities like protein, molecule,\nand disease [ 84,152,153,165], etc. Li et al . [72] , Wang et al . [152]\npropose retrieval-based frameworks by retrieving from the database\nto guide molecule generation. Liu et al . [84] introduce a multi-modal\nmolecule structure-text model by retrieving textual knowledge from\na large-scale dataset for molecular property prediction. In addition,\nRA-LLMs also significantly influence Protein representation and\ngeneration [ 91,136]. For instance, RSA [ 91] queries protein se-\nquences associated with a collection of structurally or functionally\nsimilar sequences in the database to enhance protein representa-\ntions. Furthermore, Lozano et al . [86] present a clinical QA system\nbased on retrieving published review articles.\n5.3.2 Finance. In the highly data-driven and information-intensive\nfield of finance, RA-LLMs have proved to be a significant technology\nfor enhancing decision-making [ 73,169,178]. For example, Zhang\net al. [178] retrieve financial information from external sources,\nsuch as news platforms (e.g., Bloomberg and Reuters) and social\nmedia platforms (e.g., Twitter, Reddit), to combine with the original\nquery to enhance the precision of financial sentiment analysis. In\naddition, financial QA is another primary task of financial analysis,\nwhich usually extracts relevant knowledge from financial docu-\nments. As professional documents are usually stored in PDF format,\nLin[79] introduces a PDF parser combined with RA-LLMs to re-\ntrieve knowledge from financial reports. On the other hand, Yepes\net al. [169] propose a document chunking method based on struc-\nture instead of chunking based on paragraphs, further improving\nthe quality of RA-LLMs outputs.\n6 FUTURE CHALLENGES AND\nOPPORTUNITIES\nSince the studies of RA-LLMs are still in the early stage, we present\nsome potential research directions that can be explored in the future\nin the field of RA-LLMs.\nTrustworthy RA-LLMs . The essential objective of developing\nRAG-empowered LLMs is to enhance the capability of the language\nmodels, thereby benefiting users and society by alleviating redun-\ndant and meaningless labor, increasing conveniences, and spurring\nsocial progress. However, recent research indicates that RA-LLMs\ncan be maliciously and unintentionally manipulated to make un-\nreliable decisions and harm humans [ 23,192], which may have\nserious consequences in safety-critical scenarios [ 11,13,29,34,82].\nIn addition, private retrieval database has a risk of leakage, raising\nconcerns regarding the privacy of RA-LLMs [ 177]. Therefore, de-\nveloping trustworthy RA-LLMs is of paramount importance as it\ncan significantly mitigate the potential negative impacts of LLMs\ntechnology and provide people with powerful AI models that can be\nfully trusted. To be specific, the ideal trustworthiness in RA-LLMs\nsystems should possess the following characteristics: 1) robust-\nness , 2)fairness , 3)explainability , and 4) privacy . For example,\nrobustness means a trustworthy RA-LLMs system should be ro-\nbust against malicious or inadvertent perturbations introduced by\nattackers. Fairness indicates a trustworthy RA-LLMs system ought\nto avoid discrimination during the decision-making process. Ex-\nplainability requires a complete understanding of the intrinsic\n11\nConference\u201917, July 2017, Washington, DC, USAYujuan Ding1, Wenqi Fan1\u2217, Liangbo Ning1, Shijie Wang1, Hengyun Li1,\nDawei Yin2, Tat-Seng Chua3, and Qing Li1\nworkings of RA-LLMs systems, i.e., the predictions of RA-LLMs sys-\ntems are explainable and transparent. Privacy entails safeguarding\nthe safety of this private information housed within the datastore\nwhen establishing trustworthy RA-LLMs systems.\nMulti-Lingual RA-LLMs . The ability of leveraging knowledge\nfrom multiple languages can greatly enhance the capabilities of\nretrieval-augmented language models. As the world becomes in-\ncreasingly interconnected, there is a growing need for AI systems\nthat can understand and communicate across different languages.\nBy incorporating multilingual knowledge retrieval and generation,\nthese models can access and synthesize information from diverse\nlinguistic sources, enabling more comprehensive and nuanced un-\nderstanding and generation capabilities. Additionally, multilingual\nmodels can facilitate cross-cultural communication and knowledge\nsharing and breaking down language barriers, thereby bringing con-\nvenience to people across different regions of the world, especially\nthose in areas with minority languages [ 53,75]. For example, users\nfrom countries with less prevalent languages can utilize abundant\nEnglish and Chinese corpora for knowledge retrieval, enhancing\nthe performance of large language models in downstream tasks.\nMulti-modal RA-LLMs . Multi-modal retrieval-augmented gener-\nation extends the knowledge sources beyond text to include various\ndata modalities such as images, videos, and audio. By integrating\nvarious modalities, LLMs can leverage richer contextual informa-\ntion than single-modal RAG and develop a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of users\u2019 needs, bringing precise, fine-grained, and\nhigh-quality generation. For instance, an image or video can provide\nvaluable visual cues that complement textual information, leading\nto more precise language generation [ 46,191]. By fusing multiple\nmodalities, multi-modal RA-LLMs can develop a more comprehen-\nsive understanding of the world, leading to more accurate and\ninsightful outputs, benefiting a wide range of domains, including\nhealthcare [ 191], drug discovery [ 129], molecular analysis [ 3,84],\netc.\nQuality of External Knowledge . As a commonly used datastore\nin current RAG systems, Wikipedia [ 56,191] serves as a vast reposi-\ntory of external textual knowledge used to augment the generation\nprocess, which contains millions of articles covering various disci-\nplines. However, the reliability and accuracy of individual articles\nwithin Wikipedia vary significantly, and the introduction of some\ntexts that deviate from facts might even mislead the model\u2019s gener-\nation process. Therefore, it is crucial to enhance the quality of the\nexternal knowledge corpus and mitigate the negative impact of low-\nquality knowledge on the performance of LLMs. By enhancing the\nquality of the external knowledge and tailing robust mechanisms\nby filtering out low-quality or unreliable information, the RAG-\nempowered LLM systems might produce more accurate, reliable\noutputs, thereby improving their effectiveness in various real-world\napplications.\n7 CONCLUSION\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG), a cutting-edge AI tech-\nnique, has achieved remarkable success across various applications,\nincluding recommendations, molecule generation, protein represen-\ntation, and software engineering, owing to the powerful capabilitiesof retrieval in providing supplementary information to enhance gen-\neration performance. Recently, increasing efforts have been made\nto alleviate the limitations of large language models (LLMs), such\nas hallucination and out-of-date internal knowledge, by leveraging\nretrieval to provide the latest auxiliary information and teaching\nLLMs to harness the retrieved external knowledge. With the rapid\nadvancements in retrieval-augmented large language models (RA-\nLLMs), there is a pressing need for a comprehensive and systematic\noverview. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we comprehensively\nreview the RA-LLMs from architectures, training strategies, and\napplications perspectives, providing researchers with an in-depth\nunderstanding. Moreover, since the studies of RA-LLMs are still in\nthe early stage, we also discuss the current limitations and several\npotential research directions for future research.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Josh Achiam, Steven Adler, Sandhini Agarwal, Lama Ahmad, Ilge Akkaya, Floren-\ncia Leoni Aleman, Diogo Almeida, Janko Altenschmidt, Sam Altman, Shyamal\nAnadkat, et al .2023.

This textbook provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence and\nsecurity issues, defining critical terms and reviewing the history of intelligence as\npracticed in the United States. Designed in a practical sequence, the book begins with the\nbasics of intelligence, progresses through its history, describes best practices, and\nexplores the way the intelligence community looks and operates today. The authors\nexamine the \u2018pillars\u2019 of the American intelligence system\u2014collection, analysis,\ncounterintelligence, and covert operations\u2014and demonstrate how these work together to\nprovide \u2018decision advantage\u2019. The book offers equal treatment to the functions of the\nintelligence world\u2014balancing coverage on intelligence collection, counterintelligence,\ninformation management, critical thinking, and decision-making. It also covers such\nvital issues as laws and ethics, writing and briefing for the intelligence community, and\nthe emerging threats and challenges that intelligence professionals will face in the future.\nThis revised and updated second edition addresses issues such as the growing influence\nof Russia and China, the emergence of the Islamic State, and the effects the Snowden and\nManning leaks have had on the intelligence community.\nThis book will be essential reading for students of intelligence studies, US national\nsecurity, and IR in general.\nCarl J.

It is knowledge that has been specially prepared for a customer\u2019s unique\ncircumstances. The word knowledge highlights the need for human involvement. Intelligence collection systems\nproduce \u2026 data, not intelligence; only the human mind can provide that special touch that makes sense of data\nfor different customers\u2019 requirements.\nCaptain William S.

Information and the intelligence drawn from that\ninformation directly influence the daily decisions of individuals, businesses, industry, the\nmilitary, and the government. Nations have risen and fallen on the power of intelligence\nand the decisions that have resulted from it. Thus, the ability to know, anticipate, and\nplan is very powerful.\nThe hope of decision-makers is that intelligence will provide knowledge of\nquantitative factors and afford insight into the intangible. When that happens,\nintelligence can describe existing situations and identify or confirm capabilities that will\nshape future conditions.\nThroughout the text, we will expand on the ideas presented in this chapter. One\noverriding theme that readers should keep in mind is this: however we examine\nintelligence, from the perspective of the public (government), military, or the private\nsector (business), its purpose is to provide that critical edge in decision-making that shifts\nthe balance in favor of the decision-maker. This is a concept known as \ndecision\nadvantage\n, where one knows more than a competitor or adversary. This concept is very\nimportant in today\u2019s intelligence world. In a 2008 publication titled \nVision 2015: A\nGlobally Networked and Integrated Intelligence Enterprise\n, the Director of National\nIntelligence (DNI) quoted Georgetown professor Jennifer Sims when describing the\nbenefits of decision advantage:\nThe key to intelligence-driven victories may not be the collection of objective \u2018truth\u2019 so much as the gaining of\nan information edge or competitive advantage over an adversary. Such an advantage can dissolve a decision-\nmaker\u2019s quandary and allow him to act. This ability to lubricate choice is the real objective of intelligence.\n(Director of National Intelligence, 2008: 8)\n10\nWhat Is Intelligence?\nAs we shall see, intelligence is itself a dynamic concept that does not have just one\ndefinition or application. As mentioned above, the ultimate purpose of the intelligence\nproduct is simple: provide an edge to the decision-maker. Intelligence is many things, but\nfoundationally, its core mission is to provide knowledge of the world in which we live.\nThis may come as a surprise to \nthose weaned on spy movies and fiction\u2014although the\nIntelligence Community (IC) does engage in covert and operational activities when the\nneed arises, the production of knowledge is its main mission. At a conference your\nauthors once attended, a senior IC official explained to students why the suave, fictional\nMI-6 operative James Bond may, in reality, be the world\u2019s worst spy. We include his\nexplanation in \nBox 1.1\n.\nBox 1.1\n \nJames Bond: World\u2019s Worst Spy?\nJames Bond is a fictional spy created by Ian Fleming, who once worked for British\nIntelligence. Bond movies are wildly entertaining, with numerous action sequences\nand intense romances. However, at a conference attended by your authors, a\nprominent figure from an American intelligence agency once described why Bond\nmay be the world\u2019s worst spy:\nEveryone knows who he is\u2014the phrase \u201cBond, James Bond\u201d brings instant\nrecognition. In reality, spies need to keep their identities confidential.\nBond causes a scene everywhere he goes\u2014from car chases to shooting on\nthe run, he wreaks havoc wherever he is. Real spies must remain discreet.\nHe has questionable and frequent romantic relationships, often with agents\nfrom the other side. In reality, such actions can lead to compromising\nsituations and blackmail.\nWhile intelligence agencies run on information, Bond never files reports.\nHe seems to do all his talking with his fists.\n11\nThe Challenge of Defining Intelligence\nNo single definition of intelligence is accepted by all. The term itself is used in a variety\nof ways, which makes it difficult to come up with a single definition. Complicating the\nproblem, different agencies have particular missions and operate under different rules.\nFor example, the focus of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is international. It has\nan entirely different set of guidelines than the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),\nwhich has both a law enforcement and domestic intelligence mission. Hence, both define\nintelligence differently.\nThe title of a 2002 article by Michael Warner frames the issue nicely: \u201cWanted: A\nDefinition of \u2018Intelligence\u2019\u201d (Warner, 2002). Noting the many definitions that abound,\nWarner concluded that although definitions vary, the common purpose of the\nintelligence enterprise remains relatively consistent. Using the Hoover Commission of\n1955 as an example, he noted that its simple definition seemed to do the trick:\nintelligence \u201cdeal[s] with all the \nthings which should be known in advance of initiating a\ncourse of action\u201d (Warner, 2002).\nAlthough Warner may have been satisfied with that simple description, the issue\nremains unsettled. For example, the \nInternational Dictionary of Intelligence\n defines it as:\n[T]he product resulting from the collecting and processing of information concerning actual and potential\nsituations and conditions relating to domestic and foreign activities and to domestic and foreign or US and\nenemy-held areas. (Carl & Bancroft, 1990)\nContrast the above with the definition used by the FBI:\nSimply defined, intelligence is information that has been analyzed and refined so that it is useful to policymakers\nin making decisions\u2014specifically, decisions about potential threats to our national security. (Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, n.d.)\nThe FBI further articulates three aspects of intelligence:\n1\n. \nIntelligence is a product that consists of information that has been refined to meet the needs of\npolicymakers.\n2\n. \nIntelligence is also a process through which that information is identified, collected, and analyzed.\n3\n. \nIntelligence refers to both the individual organizations that shape raw data into a finished\nintelligence product for the benefit of decision-makers and the larger community of these\norganizations.\n(Federal Bureau of Investigation, n.d.)\nThe 2013 Department of Defense publication, \nJoint Intelligence (JP 2-O)\n, provides yet\nanother definition, one with a decidedly military spin:\nThe product resulting from the collection, processing, integration, evaluation, analysis, and interpretation of\navailable information concerning foreign nations, hostile or potentially hostile forces or elements, or areas of\nactual or potential operations. (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2013: GL 8)\n12\nAn examination of each definition makes one thing clear: agencies define intelligence to\nmeet their particular needs and missions. For example, the FBI is concerned primarily\nwith domestic and international threats confronting the homeland, what it defines as\n\u201cpotential threats to our national security.\u201d The military, on the other hand, is concerned\nwith \u201cforeign nations, \nhostile or potentially hostile forces or elements, or areas of actual\nor potential operations.\u201d\nIn its 1999 \nConsumers\u2019 Guide to Intelligence\n, the CIA provided this succinct definition:\nReduced to its simplest terms, intelligence is knowledge and foreknowledge of the world around us\u2014the prelude\nto decision and action by US policymakers. (Central Intelligence Agency, 1999: vii)\nNote that the CIA adds the requirement that intelligence should act as a \u201cprelude to\ndecision and action,\u201d implying that it should not merely satisfy idle curiosity; according\nto this definition, intelligence must be useful for some larger purpose, generally one that\nserves the national interest. This sort of intelligence, which can empower a consumer\ntoward some level of understanding or action, is often termed \nactionable intelligence\n.\nSome argue that \nall\n intelligence should strive toward this state.\nEach of these definitions contains elements of the larger picture, and all have the\nbenefit of brevity. Yet none encompasses the wide range of activities carried out by\ntoday\u2019s IC. A more comprehensive and illuminating definition appears in \nIntelligence:\nFrom Secrets to Policy\n, written by retired CIA analyst Mark Lowenthal:\nIntelligence is the process by which specific types of information important to national security are requested,\ncollected, analyzed, and provided to policymakers; the products of that process; the safeguarding of these\nprocesses and this information by counterintelligence activities; and the carrying out of operations as requested\nby lawful authorities. (Lowenthal, 2015: 10)\nLowenthal\u2019s definition is salient for several reasons. In the first place, it highlights the\nvarious aspects of the definition as commonly used today. Intelligence is a \nprocess\n, one\nthat involves many steps. These will be discussed at length in \nChapter 7\n (\u201cPutting It All\nTogether: The Intelligence Cycle\u201d). As a process, it is also dynamic\u2014that is, intelligence\nactivities do not stop.\nIntelligence is also a \nproduct\n, such as national intelligence estimates that detail\nanalyses of particular strategic issues, or the Presidential Daily Brief, which is a succinct\nrendering of important issues prepared specially for the President of the United States.\nMany, but not all, of these products are classified\u2014 that is, only those individuals with a\nsufficient security clearance and a \u201cneed-to-know\u201d may access them.\nIntelligence is also about protecting what we know\u2014what is termed\ncounterintelligence.\n Achieving decision advantage is not just about learning as \nmuch as\npossible about an adversary; it is also about protecting one\u2019s own information. Just as a\nfootball team needs to play both offense and defense well, the IC needs to both protect\nand acquire\u2014if either is not achieved, decision advantage can be lost.\nFinally, intelligence often refers to the \ncommunity\n that collects and analyzes important\ninformation and disseminates it as intelligence. \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d) discusses the\nmyriad parts of today\u2019s IC: the 17 agencies that make up the nucleus of the federal\n13\nintelligence world; the other federal, state, and local agencies that also participate in the\neffort; and the private sector, with its huge resources and wide breadth.\n14\nInformation and Intelligence\nAt this point, readers should realize that we have made a great effort to separate the\nterms \u201cinformation\u201d and \u201cintelligence.\u201d In fact, they are not synonymous. \nInformation\n is\nunprocessed material of every description that can be used to produce intelligence. It is,\nin essence, \u201craw data.\u201d Since intelligence is derived from information, it shares many\nattributes with information. Information, and the intelligence that results from it, is\nperishable. Information will often be incomplete, sometimes confusing, and\ncontradictory. Not all information will be important or even relevant, and much of it\nmay be inaccurate or misleading. Too much information can be as harmful as too little.\nWith all information, we seek not a large amount, but rather to have the right\ninformation available when needed. In today\u2019s world, obtaining the \u201cright\u201d information\nis becoming increasingly more difficult because of the sheer amount of data available.\nBox 1.2\n provides a description of the \u201cKnowledge Doubling Curve,\u201d an idea articulated\nby architect and futurist R. Buckminster Fuller in 1981 that helps explain how and why\nwe are awash in so much information.\nBox 1.2\n \nKnowledge Doubling Curve\nR. Buckminster Fuller was a visionary in many areas, including architecture and\nimagining the future. In his 1981 book \nCritical Path\n, Fuller created the \u201cKnowledge\nDoubling Curve,\u201d an analysis of the rate at which human knowledge has increased\nthroughout history (Fuller, 1981). Until 1900, human knowledge doubled\napproximately every century; by the end of World War II, that window had shrunk\nto every 25 years. According to Schilling (2013), certain types of technical\nknowledge double every 18 months in today\u2019s world; he cites an IBM study that\nsuggests the \u201cinternet of things\u201d will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12\nhours in the future.\nThe world of intelligence is one fraught with ambiguity and uncertainty\u2014 agencies\nrarely have enough good, reliable information upon which to make ironclad judgments.\nIn addition, adversaries also want to gain decision advantage. As a result, they feed\ndisinformation\n, or intentionally false information, in the hope of disguising their true\nactivities or intentions.\nCan raw information ever rise to the level of intelligence? The dividing line is far from\nclear. However, if a member of the IC received uncorroborated and unverified\ninformation that someone had planted a nuclear device across town that would detonate\nin 30 minutes, unless they had very good reason to doubt its authenticity, they would act\n15\nas if it were intelligence\u2014that is, they would assume that both the source and\ninformation might be credible and would take appropriate action. The risk of acting\notherwise would be too great. Ideally, all information will undergo the process described\nin \nChapter 7\n (\u201cPutting It All Together: The Intelligence Cycle\u201d). However, operational\nrealities and short deadlines often preclude that. Instead, the trend indicates that more\nand more decision-makers want to see raw data rather than wait for a finished product.\nAlthough their impatience is understandable, some critics worry that this shortcuts the\nimportant \u201cvalue-added\u201d that analysts with a deep understanding of the subject provide.\n16\nTypes of Intelligence\nIntelligence products can be divided into various categories depending on their focus or\nscope. Some products are \ntactical\n, which means they are designed for near-term use,\nusually by on-the-ground personnel. For example, an army unit on patrol would be\ninterested in whether the enemy is over the next hill; likewise, drug agents may want to\nknow the background of the suspected drug dealers they are about to meet. Such\nintelligence has a great deal of immediacy. As a result, the process by which it is\nconverted from information to intelligence is often shortcut. In some cases, this is\nnecessary and desirable. If a Predator unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) spotted what\nappeared to be an enemy patrol in Afghanistan about to ambush coalition forces, it\nwould be imprudent not to warn the soldiers in the field. However, haste can lead to\nmiscalculations; on more than a few occasions, \u201cfriendly fire\u201d has killed allies or civilians\nmistaken for enemy combatants on the battlefield.\nAnother type of intelligence, generally consumed by senior leaders and policymakers,\nis \nstrategic\n intelligence. This refers to longer-term issues that have large implications\nand potential consequences (see \nFigure 1.1\n). It may entail broad topics, such as economic\nprojections, and often looks out into the future. For example, the DNI has produced a\nseries of studies concerning whether Iran intends to produce nuclear weapons. This is, of\ncourse, an \nissue that concerns individuals at the highest levels of the chain-of-command,\nincluding the President, who have to make the serious decision of whether to carry out a\nmilitary strike. Usually, strategic products require much more lead-time than tactical\nones. By definition, they require meticulous research and analysis, given their\nseriousness. The highest-level strategic product disseminated by the U.S. IC is a National\nIntelligence Estimate, further described in \nChapter 11\n (\u201cWriting and Briefing for the\nIntelligence Community\u201d). Multiple analysts working for various agencies prepare these\nproducts. They go through an exceptional preparation and review process to ensure that\nthe information is as correct as possible and that the analysis is solid.\n17\nFigure 1.1\n U.S. Army and Colombian military personnel scrutinize intelligence to formulate operational\nstrategies. (Source: Sgt. Mahlet Tesfaye, U.S. Army South Public Affairs)\nA third type of intelligence, termed \noperational\n intelligence, is often used by the\nmilitary. This type falls somewhere between tactical and strategic and is usually used at\na battalion or expeditionary force level.\nIntelligence can also be categorized based on the area it covers. The IC draws a sharp\ndistinction between \nforeign\n and \ndomestic\n intelligence. The reason for this should be\nobvious\u2014those residing in the United States\u2014\u201cU.S. persons\u201d\u2014are afforded significant\nrights under the Constitution; these same rights do not apply to non-U.S. citizens\nresiding overseas.\nAccording to Title 50, United States Code 401a, which has its origin with the National\nSecurity Act of 1947, foreign intelligence is defined as:\n[I]nformation relating to the capabilities, intentions, or activities of foreign governments or elements thereof,\nforeign organizations, or foreign persons, or international terrorist activities. (Government Printing Office, 2009)\nForeign intelligence exists to provide information to decision-makers at all levels of\ngovernment so that they can apply the power they have at their disposal more precisely.\nAgencies such as the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) have a foreign mission\u2014 they are not permitted to focus on\ndomestic intelligence issues.\nDomestic intelligence agencies exist to provide the same service to policy makers who\nwield power domestically. Even though a single agency could collect and analyze\nintelligence information both overseas and at home, as the Soviet Union\u2019s KGB did, in\nthe U.S., foreign and domestic intelligence collection is separated to protect domestic\ncivil liberties. Agencies such as the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\nhave domestic powers; each also stations personnel overseas to work with foreign law\nenforcement and intelligence organizations (Marrin, 2003).\n18\nFunctions of Intelligence Agencies\nIntelligence agencies engage in up to five discrete activities. Some agencies, such as the\nCIA, engage in all five; others perform fewer. In his book \nIntelligence: From Secrets to\nPolicy\n, Lowenthal (2015) discusses four: collection, analysis, covert activities, and\ncounterintelligence. To this list, we add a fifth: the management of intelligence.\nCollection\n is the act of gathering information and data. In the IC, the collection\nplatform is often used to describe the type of intelligence that is produced. This has given\nrise to the naming convention of the \u201cINTs,\u201d which is the suffix attached to an acronym\ndescribing the type of information collected (acronyms are ubiquitous in the intelligence\nworld). For example, HUMINT refers to \u201chuman intelligence,\u201d or information obtained\nfrom human sources. Even though the suffix \u201cINT\u201d is used, readers should be cautioned\nthat what is being gathered is information, not intelligence. As discussed above,\ninformation must generally go through a process to become intelligence.\nThe explosion in technology over the past 20 years has given rise to new sources of\ninformation\u2014satellites, computers, cell phones, and the like, provide scores of data.\nToday, the issue for the IC is not lack of information; rather, it is \u201cseparating the wheat\nfrom the chaff\u201d\u2014finding one piece \nof information among the terabytes that, when linked\nwith other data, will provide the answers that policymakers seek. Collection issues are\nexamined in \nChapter 4\n (\u201cCollection\u201d).\nRaw information in and of itself usually does not equal intelligence. First, it must be\nlinked, interpreted, and contextualized; this is the process of \nanalysis\n. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, many experts blame recent intelligence lapses, such as the failure to prevent\nthe 9/11 attacks and the false conclusion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of\nmass destruction, on problems with analysis, not collection. The phrase \u201cconnecting the\ndots\u201d has come to epitomize the rather simplistic conclusion that, if only analysts had\npaid more attention and had better shared information, they could have prevented the\nattacks of 9/11. Although this conceivably may have been the case, it severely\nunderestimates the difficulty in performing analysis. As previously explained,\ninformation is often ambiguous and of questionable reliability; additionally, the sheer\nvolume that is received makes it difficult to prioritize what is the most important.\nChapter 5\n (\u201cBarriers to Analysis\u201d) describes the difficulties associated with analysis,\nwhereas \nChapter 6\n (\u201cAnalytical Methods\u201d) discusses strategies the IC has used to\nimprove its analytical methods.\nThe next function that IC agencies engage in is \ncounterintelligence\n (CI), or the\nprotection of information and intelligence. There are many ways this can be\naccomplished. The first is primarily defensive\u2014information is assigned a level of\nclassification based on its sensitivity and potential harm to national security if released.\nMost readers will be familiar with the terms \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201csecret,\u201d and \u201ctop secret.\u201d\n19\nThese are levels of security ranging from low to high. To access classified information,\nindividuals must possess security clearances equal to or greater than the intelligence they\nwish to view. To receive a clearance, a person must successfully pass an in-depth\nbackground investigation. This is a detailed process where agencies examine every facet\nof an individual\u2019s life. Additionally, drug tests and polygraph examinations are often\nincluded as part of the investigation.\nCounterintelligence also has an offensive aspect. Every agency of the IC has a security\noffice responsible for seeking out security breaches and leaks. Unfortunately, the United\nStates has had its share of double agents who betrayed the trust of the country by\nproviding classified information to adversaries. Of course, this is what HUMINT is all\nabout\u2014CIA Case Officers attempt to convince citizens of foreign countries to do exactly\nthe same thing for the benefit of the United States. Individuals caught spying are usually\nsubjected to harsh punishments\u2014 in many countries, the penalty is death. In the United\nStates, spies such as Robert Hanssen and Aldrich Ames often receive a sentence of life in\nprison. The FBI is the lead agency in the United States for conducting\ncounterintelligence; it is the Bureau\u2019s second priority, just behind the prevention of\nterrorism.\nAnother offensive way to carry out CI is by disseminating disinformation. If\nsuccessful, this can tie up an adversary\u2019s resources and send them in false directions. It\ncan also mislead them about intentions or capabilities. CI is discussed in \nChapter 8\n(\u201cCounterintelligence\u201d).\nWhen many people think of the IC, they envision \ncovert operations\n, such as the\nfailed Bay of Pigs operation or the killing of Osama Bin Laden. In fact, the IC carries out\ncovert ops relatively infrequently and only with permission from the highest authorities.\nThe key characteristic of a successful covert op is \nplausible deniability\n, where the\noperation itself cannot be traced back to the U.S. government. Oftentimes, this\ndeniability fails, especially when the operation proves unsuccessful. There has been\nmuch debate concerning whether covert operations have, in the long run, helped or hurt\nU.S. interests. Proponents claim that much good has been accomplished over the years,\noften out of the glare of media scrutiny. Others maintain that these types of activities are\noften discovered and, even when successful, lead to undesirable and unintended\nconsequences. For example, in 1953, the CIA engineered a coup that led to the overthrow\nof the popularly-elected prime minister of Iran. Years later, however, another coup\ndeposed the U.S.-selected leader and led to the formation of an anti-American theocracy\nthat persists to this day. Presently, Iran is a major foreign policy challenge for the United\nStates. Covert operations are discussed in \nChapter 9\n (\u201cCovert Operations\u201d).\nFinally, IC agencies engage in \nintelligence management\n. This consists of several\nphases. The first involves organizing and processing the voluminous amounts of data\nthat arrive daily. It also involves storing intelligence once produced. There are literally\nlibraries-worth of information and intelligence that the IC stores and maintains because\none never knows what may prove important someday. Lastly, managing intelligence\nincludes its proper dissemination. This is a critical and sometimes overlooked step in the\n20\nprocess. Intelligence that is not delivered properly will be ignored. Ignored intelligence is\nno better than intelligence that was never produced. In Greek mythology, Cassandra was\na beautiful noblewoman who was granted the giftof prophecy by Apollo. However,\nbecause she spurned his romantic advances, he placed a curse on her that no one would\nbelieve her predictions. Analysts who cannot articulate their thoughts properly will\nsuffer the fate of Cassandra.\nOn the other hand, intelligence that makes its way to the wrong hands can prove\ndeadly. The history of the IC is littered with stories about the imprisonment and deaths\nof human sources whose clandestine activities were compromised. \nBox 1.3\n describes the\ncareer and death of Soviet Colonel Oleg Penkovsky, who provided much important\ninformation to the United States and the United Kingdom during the Cold War.\nBox 1.3\n \nFrom the CIA: The Capture and Execution of\nColonel OLEG Penkovsky, 1963\nOn the afternoon of October 22, 1962, a nondescript man was suddenly seized off the\nstreets of Moscow by the KGB. He had been under surveil-lance on suspicion of\ntreason. Thus ended Oleg Penkovsky\u2019s career of spying for the United States and\nGreat Britain. Penkovsky is considered one of the most valuable assets in Agency\nhistory.\nPenkovsky the Spy\nPenkovsky was a colonel in the GRU\u2014Soviet military intelligence\u2014and the highest\nlevel Soviet officer to spy for the United States or Great Britain up to that time.\nDuring his time in the military, Penkovsky grew disillusioned with the Soviet\nregime. He felt that Nikita Krushchev was leading the Soviet Union down the path\nto destruction with his relentless pursuit of spreading Communism throughout the\nworld. Penkovsky wanted to help prevent a nuclear war between the superpowers,\nso he volunteered to spy for the United States and the United Kingdom.\n***\nIn the summer of 1962, the Soviet Union deployed nuclear missiles to Cuba. The\nSoviets believed that the United States would not detect the missiles until it was too\nlate to take action. Penkovsky provided detailed plans and descriptions of the\nlaunch sites in Cuba. Without this information, it would have been very difficult to\nidentify which missiles were at the launch sites and track their operational\nreadiness.\nDuring the Cuban Missile Crisis, Penkovsky\u2019s information gave the Kennedy\n21\nAdministration technical insights about the Soviet nuclear missiles deployed to\nCuba that assisted in the pursuit of an eventual diplomatic solution. Because of\nPenkovksy, Kennedy knew that he had three days before the Soviet missiles were\nfully functional to negotiate a diplomatic solution. For this reason, Penkovsky is\ncredited with altering the course of the Cold War.\n***\nCapture, Trial, and Execution\nTo this day, it is unclear who or what implicated Penkovsky \u2026 At that point, the\nKGB began to keep a close watch on Penkovsky. KGB officers were stationed in\napartments above and across the river from Penkovksy\u2019s home. After an extended\nperiod of surveillance, the KGB arrested Penkovsky and put him on trial for treason\nand espionage.\nAfter a public trial in May 1963, Penkovsky was sentenced to death. He was\nexecuted in Lubyanka Prison in Moscow on May 16, 1963. Penkovsky\u2019s ashes\nallegedly were dumped into a mass grave at Donskoi Monastery cemetery in\nMoscow.\nSource:\n Central Intelligence Agency (2013).\nAs you might imagine, the IC places a great deal of emphasis on writing and briefing.\nWriting must be concise, clear, and accurate. Important information, such as one\u2019s\nconclusion, is rendered first. This style is termed \nbottom line up front (BLUF)\n. Because\npolicymakers are busy people, they generally do not have time for long-winded\nexplanations. This holds true for both writing and briefing\u2014an experienced briefer will\nget to the main points quickly while avoiding \u201cfluff.\u201d We discuss management and\ncommunications in \nChapters 7\n (\u201cPutting It All Together: The Intelligence Cycle\u201d) and 11\n(\u201cWriting and Briefing for the Intelligence Community\u201d).\n22\nPolicymakers and Decision-Makers\nIn this text, we use the terms \u201cpolicymaker\u201d and \u201cdecision-maker\u201d interchangeably. We\nnote, however, that they do not necessarily mean the same thing. A decision-maker is, as\nthe name implies, one who has to make decisions, oftentimes for an agency or\norganization. This can occur at both the strategic and tactical levels. A policymaker, on\nthe other hand, makes decisions that affect policy\u2014in many cases, this means a decision\nat the strategic level. Every policymaker is a decision-maker, but the opposite is not\nnecessarily true. Each, however, is a potential consumer of intelligence.\nIt is important to understand the relationship between the IC and\npolicymakers/decision-makers. In fact, those who produce intelligence should refrain\nfrom formulating policy\u2014that is not their job. Instead, intelligence professionals should\ndescribe the world around them in the most objective way possible, free from political or\npersonal concerns. It is their responsibility to \u201ctell it like it is\u201d to the decision-maker.\nOccasionally, this involves passing along bad news, for example, telling a policymaker\nthat his or her plans or policies are not achieving their desired ends. This takes a great\ndeal of bravery\u2014no one likes hearing bad news. Given the political intrigue that is often\nfound in organizations, the IC analyst may be the \nonly\n individual \nwho tells the boss\nunfortunate news. This is the beauty and the power of the position\u2014good decisions can\nonly be made in honest circumstances. To that end, the brave analyst, one who is willing\nto speak the truth, may be the best friend policymakers have, whether they recognize it\nor not.\nThis relationship can prove quite tricky. In a very real sense, the IC professional and\npolicymaker share a producer\u2013consumer relationship. Policy-makers are under no\nobligation to \u201cbuy\u201d what the IC has to \u201csell.\u201d The IC\u2019s product is, of course, its\nintelligence. If the intel provides a value-added component, a wise policymaker will\ncontinue to access and utilize it. However, if it appears to be of limited utility, the\npolicymaker will soon begin to ignore both it and the messenger; the analyst will lose\never-important \naccess\n to the consumer. In this case, they will truly become a Cassandra\n\u2014even their most well-constructed analysis will be for naught.\nThis is complicated by the fact that many policymakers feel that they already have a\ngood \u201chandle\u201d on the subject being analyzed. Some whose level of knowledge may be no\ndeeper than that obtained by watching television news may feel that they have all the\nanswers and that analysts, even those with decades of experience, may have little to\noffer.\nAs one can imagine, this can become a difficult situation. There is no perfect solution.\nEven looking at presidents over time, one sees widely differing relationships with the IC.\nSome loved covert operations, whereas others refused to engage in them. Some insisted\non regular briefings and meetings, whereas others would go for long periods of time\n23\nwithout significant contact. To a large extent, this appears to have been driven by\npersonality and experience. For example, the first President Bush was a former director\nof the CIA before his ascension to the Presidency. He had a familiarity with intel matters\nand an appreciation for what the IC could do. As a result, his contact with intelligence\nagencies was frequent. President Clinton, on the other hand, lacked this level of\nfamiliarity and comfort; his dealings were much more sporadic.\n24\nIntelligence Foundations in U.S. Government\nIntelligence has been a function of the government since the beginning of the republic.\nGeorge Washington (\nFigure 1.2\n) put intelligence to decisive military use during the\nAmerican Revolution; it has been an integral part of U.S. military operations ever since.\nOver the next 200 years, the intelligence of the U.S. government evolved into an\nelaborate and complex collection of agencies with global capabilities. The rich history of\nthe evolution of U.S. intelligence will be discussed in \nChapter 2\n.\nFigure 1.2\n George Washington, the nation\u2019s first Spymaster. (Source: Library of Congress Prints and\nPhotographs Division Washington, D.C.)\n25\nU.S. Intelligence Community\nThe U.S. IC is a coalition of 17 agencies and organizations within the executive branch\nthat works both independently and collaboratively to gather the intelligence necessary to\nconduct foreign relations and national security activities (\nFigure 1.3\n). The primary\nmission of the IC is to collect and convey the essential information that the president and\nmembers of the policymaking, law enforcement, and military communities require to\nexecute their appointed duties. The 17 agencies possess a wide range of capabilities and\nintelligence needs themselves. In addition to these 17 organizations, the IC also consists\nof other federal, local, state, and private organizations, all of which are described in\nChapter 3\n.\nFigure 1.3\n Organizational Chart of the U.S. Intelligence Community. (Source: Office of the Director of\nNational Intelligence)\n26\nPurpose of Intelligence\nThe decision-maker generally wants intelligence to answer three basic questions:\n1\n. \nWhat capabilities do our adversaries possess?\n2\n. \nWhat are their intentions\u2014in particular, what is the most dangerous thing they\nmay do?\n3\n. \nWhat effect might all this have on our ability to accomplish our national goals?\nObviously, answers to these questions are very important, especially when they concern\nsuch volatile situations as Iran, North Korea, or the Islamic State. Perhaps the biggest\nvalue-added for policymakers is that good intelligence reduces uncertainty\u2014although it\nmay not answer every question, it allows leaders to make better decisions; indeed, it\nprovides them with decision advantage.\n27\nLimitations of Intelligence\nThere are limits to what intelligence can provide. Intelligence may reveal \u201csecrets\u201d\n(information that is knowable but hidden); however, some situations remain \u201cmysteries,\u201d\nand agencies cannot discern their true nature. What a foreign leader is thinking, for\nexample, cannot be known unless the leader makes it known. Whether the same foreign\nleader will even be in power in a year\u2019s time is a \u201cmystery\u201d that only time will reveal.\n28\nConclusion\nThere is nothing mysterious about intelligence. Although collection and production may\ninvolve the use of high technology sensors and networks, good intelligence is primarily\nthe result of solid headwork and legwork. Good intelligence begins with decision-makers\nclearly identifying their concerns and needs. It is developed through the focused\ncollection of information, thorough study, and, most importantly, through effective\nanalysis and synthesis. The result is an intelligence product that provides knowledge,\nreduces uncertainty, and supports effective decision-making.\nFor the United States today, intelligence is more important than ever given the current\nthreat environment. Challenges are global and often emanate from transnational\nenterprises that rely on sophisticated information technology. They transcend\ngeographic boundaries as well as the boundaries of authorities in the U.S. national\nsecurity infrastructure. In this environment, having the right intelligence at the right\ntime is essential to protecting national security.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nHow would you define \u201cintelligence?\u201d What factors did you consider in\nformulating this definition?\n2\n. \nIs there really a big difference between \u201cintelligence\u201d and \u201cinformation?\u201d Why\nor why not?\n3\n. \nOf the five functions of intelligence agencies discussed in the chapter, which is\nthe most important? Why?\n4\n. \nThe relationship between the policymaker and intelligence professional is often\ndescribed as a \u201cconsumer\u2013producer\u201d relationship. Is this a good analogy? Why\nor why not? Can you think of a better description?\n5\n. \nWe briefly discussed the limitations of intelligence in the chapter. Can you\nthink of some others?\n6\n. \nThe IC receives billions of dollars of funding every year; between the public\nand private sectors, it is a massive undertaking. Yet, it has had several big\nfailures, such as not preventing the 9/11 attacks and not foreseeing the fall of\nthe Soviet Union in the latter part of the twentieth century. Why do you think\nthis was the case?\n29\nKey Terms\nAccess to the decision-maker\nActionable intelligence\nAnalysis\nBottom line up front (BLUF)\nCollection\nCounterintelligence\nCovert operations\nDecision advantage\nDomestic intelligence\nForeign intelligence\nInformation\nIntelligence\nIntelligence management\nOperational intelligence\nPlausible deniability\nStrategic intelligence\nTactical intelligence\n30\nReferences\nBrei, W.

Thanks primarily to its nonthreatening neighbors to the north and\nsouth, and oceans to the east and west, the United States has not faced existential threats.\nAdditionally, the Bill of Rights and privacy have long been staples of the American\nrepublic. Spying is, by definition, a surreptitious and invasive activity; until recently, the\nfederal government limited its use. This is not to say, however, that America has never\nengaged in intelligence collection. Indeed, over the years, the United States has enjoyed\ngreat success in the intelligence arena; it has also suffered some catastrophic failures,\nsuch as the attacks of September 11, 2001, and the surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor in\n1941. To understand why the intelligence community (IC) today is structured the way it\nis, one must first understand its history.\n33\nRevolutionary War to Civil War\nGeorge Washington was no stranger to intelligence. He developed his affinity for\nintelligence while serving the British during the French and Indian War in the 1750s,\nroughly two decades before the American Revolution. In his earliest days as an\nintelligence collector, he worked for the Virginia Royal governor, Robert Dinwiddie.\nBoth Dinwiddie and the British believed that the French were infringing upon their\nterritory in the Ohio River Valley. Dinwiddie tasked Washington to deliver a letter to the\nFrench, formally asking about their intentions regarding the region. Over copious\namounts of wine, the French soldiers revealed to a sober Washington their intent to\nbuild forts and capture territory within the valley. Washington listened carefully to their\nboasts and later conveyed all that he learned to Dinwiddie, who prepared to launch an\noffensive against the French. Thus began Washington\u2019s lifelong interest in intelligence\n(Daigler, 2014).\nIntelligence obtained paramount importance during the Revolutionary War, for both\nthe Americans and the British. In the eighteenth century, intelligence methods were\namateur, at best; long distances and ill-developed reconnaissance abilities meant an\noverreliance on such methods as invisible ink by militaries. Furthermore, the challenge\nof collecting intelligence on a new continent, i.e., North America, flustered the British,\nwho were far more \naccustomed to centuries of scouting and securing European land. As\nfor the Americans, the sheer size and ability of the British army forced them to rely on\nintelligence. Quite simply, the Americans\u2019 Continental Army could not out-power the\nBritish; they would have to outthink them. The Americans\u2019 ability to create an extensive\nintelligence apparatus helped secure their ultimate victory in 1781.\nTo enhance the Continental Army\u2019s military capability, Washington created both the\nSecret Committee\n and the \nCommittee of Secret Correspondence\n, which reported on\nBritish troop movements, carried out various covert activities, and conducted sensitive\nnegotiations with foreign governments. Washington knew that the British army was\nhighly organized and well supplied; he realized that he needed the decision advantage\ndescribed in \nChapter 1\n (\u201cAn Overview of Intelligence\u201d) if America was to prevail. He\nrelied upon a team of spies, known as the \nCulper Spy Ring\n, to transport intelligence\nabout the movements of the British. Being a spy in the eighteenth century was not an\nhonorable profession; the spies, headed by New Englander Benjamin Tallmadge, took\ntheir identities to the grave. Only since the 1930s have researchers been able to mine\nhistorical documents uncovering the spies\u2019 identities (Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2014).\nPart of the Americans\u2019 advantage consisted of keeping valuable information out of the\nhands of the enemy. In 1776, Congress passed the First Espionage Act, which made\n\u201clurking as spies in or about the fortification or encampments of the armies of the United\nStates\u201d punishable by death (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007a). Advantage also resided\n34\nin the Americans\u2019 ability to secure allies\u2019 support. Central to that support was an alliance\nwith the French, a longtime enemy of the British. Benjamin Franklin served as the first\nAmerican ambassador to France. Skilled at diplomacy, Franklin brokered intelligence\nfrom the ground in North America to the French in Paris to secure funding and military\naid.\nThere were both intelligence heroes and villains in America\u2019s struggle against the\nBritish. One of the heroes was young Nathan Hale, who agreed to go behind enemy lines\nin the Battle of Long Island to gather information. Almost immediately, he was captured\nand hanged; legend has it that, on the gallows, he uttered the famous words: \u201cI regret\nthat I have but one life to lose for my country.\u201d Today, a statue of Hale can be found on\nthe campus of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)\u2019s headquarters in Langley, Virginia.\nHale\u2019s legend as a martyr for the revolution has preceded his actual intelligence\ncapabilities. In reality, he was well intentioned, though poorly trained; the British\ncaptured him on his first mission. They discovered Hale\u2019s identity as a spy because he\nrevealed himself to a British soldier, over a friendly pint at a tavern. The British soldier,\npretending to be a Patriot, listened with delight \nas Hale described in detail his mission.\nHale\u2019s death weighed heavily upon Washington and exemplified the Americans\u2019\noccasionally feeble attempts at intelligence. Though their efforts at intelligence would\nultimately prove successful, they suffered their fair share of setbacks (Daigler, 2014).\nAn infamous setback, on the part of the Americans, involved the recruitment of a\nContinental Army general by the British. Just as the Americans sought to hone their\nintelligence skills during the War, the British did the same. One of the British\u2019s\nintelligence successes stemmed from the defection of an American soldier, Benedict\nArnold, to the British side. Arnold had planned to surrender to the British the\nContinental Army\u2019s command post at West Point. Though the plot was exposed, he was\nwelcomed to the British side and lived out the reminder of his life following the\nRevolutionary War in England. Over the course of the Revolution, the British became\nincreasingly skilled at collecting and analyzing intelligence. Nevertheless, their greatest\nsuccesses\u2014seen in their ability to scout strategic areas, recruit spies, and centralize\ninformation pouring in from deserters, refugees, and prisoners\u2014 would not mature in\ntime to allow them to win. British intelligence capability was as strong as it would ever\nbe in 1781, and yet they still lost the war. The British loss demonstrates that intelligence\nnot properly implemented on the battlefield is useless (Kaplan, 1990).\nOnce the Revolutionary War ended, Washington did not form a permanent American\nintelligence service. Instead, in the early days of the republic, Presidents ordered spying\nand covert activities as the need arose, such as it did during the War of 1812 and the\nMexican War of 1846. However, in neither case were American intelligence efforts\nnearly as successful as they had been during the Revolutionary War.\n35\nCivil War to World War I\nBoth the North and the South set up intelligence operations during the Civil War. For the\nmost part, military commanders were given wide discretion in how they gathered\nintelligence and used spies. For example, the Confederacy employed Belle Boyd and Rose\nO\u2019Neal Greenhow, who gleaned valuable information from Union officers and passed it\non to southern forces. In some cases, their intelligence was crucial in helping the\nConfederates win decisive victories.\nNot all spies were employed by the government. In 1850, Allan Pinkerton (\nFigure 2.1\n)\nset up his famous detective agency for the purpose of allowing businessmen to covertly\nkeep track of their employees. In 1861, the Pinker-tons allegedly foiled a plot to\nassassinate President-elect Abraham Lincoln in Baltimore, Maryland. Although\nhistorians debate whether the plot was in \nfact real, the buzz it generated provided great\npublicity for the agency, which went on to guard Lincoln throughout the Civil War.\nPinkerton detectives also worked as spies and agents for Union Major General George B.\nMcClellan and ran his military intelligence service (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007b).\nFigure 2.1\n Allan Pinkerton. (Source: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington, D.C.)\nPerhaps the most interesting intelligence operations of the War involved Harriet\n36\nTubman, famous for her work with the Underground Railroad. Tubman also served as an\narmed scout and a spy and helped lead a covert operation in South Carolina that freed\n700 slaves. In addition, she made sure that runaway slaves escaping to the North via the\nUnderground Railroad provided information on activities they had observed. In some\ncases, she and others were able to convince freed slaves to return to the South to engage\nin espionage and surveil-lance. The information provided by Tubman and her peers\nbecame known as the \nBlack Dispatches\n and provided much valuable intelligence to the\nNorth.\nThe Civil War also witnessed new types of intelligence collection, brought about by\nincreasingly improving technologies. For example, Thaddeus Lowe flew above the\nbattlefields in a balloon and reported on Confederate troop movements. Not everyone\nappreciated his efforts. Amazingly, President Abraham Lincoln had to convince his\ndoubting generals that this form of collection was a good idea (National Air and Space\nMuseum, 2000).\nBy the latter part of the nineteenth century, the Navy recognized that it\ntechnologically lagged behind the navies of the European powers. In 1882, it formed the\nOffice of Naval Intelligence, whose primary mission was to help modernize U.S. forces\nby learning the secrets of other countries; it also gathered military intelligence during the\nSpanish\u2013American War (Office of Naval Intelligence, n.d.). The Army soon followed suit\nand formed the Military Information Division in 1885.\n37\nLaw Enforcement Intelligence: The Palmer Raids\nAs World War I neared, there was great upheaval throughout much of the world. With\nthe Russian Revolution only a few years off, workers from around the world organized\nto oppose what they considered to be oppressive conditions foisted upon them by\nwealthy business owners and capitalists. Many of these people went on strike for fairer\nwages, fewer working hours, and better job conditions. Some, however, resorted to\nviolence. One such group, which shared many views in common with the Communists,\nwas known as the \nanarchists\n. In the United States, many anarchists included\nimmigrants who lacked citizenship. As devotees of Karl Marx, these anarchists\noriginated in Europe and became frustrated that the Communist revolutions they so\ndesperately hoped for had not taken place. In an effort to speed Communist revolutions\nalong, they resorted to violence. In the early twentieth century, many European\ngovernments dealt with the threat of anarchy within their own countries by shipping\nanarchists as immigrants to the United States. Over time, these anarchists developed a\ntransatlantic communication, where anarchists in Europe conveyed their ideas for\nrevolution to their friends and allies within the United States. Soon, the threat of anarchy\nspread from the Old World to the New. In 1914, radical anarchists began a series of\nbombings that targeted government authorities and businesses. The introduction of\ndynamite gave anarchists a huge advantage; not only could they threaten violence and a\nrevolution, but they also had the weaponized means to garner attention and to inflict\nserious harm (Messer-Kruse, 2012).\nOne Italian anarchist, Luigi Galleani, amassed a group of followers. When the\nDepartment of Labor deported Galleani back to Italy in 1919, his U.S. supporters reacted\nviolently, mailing bombs to political figures across the \ncountry. They made the grave\nmistake of mailing a bomb to then-Attorney General Mitchell Palmer. The bomb made it\nto Palmer\u2019s front door, where it exploded. Palmer was irate, and he decided it was time\nfor anarchists to return to their home countries. He enlisted the help of the Bureau of\nInvestigation (later to become the FBI). J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the General\nIntelligence Division, led the Bureau\u2019s mission to round up anarchists, known as the\nPalmer Raids\n. Although Palmer and Hoover would initially try to charge alleged\nanarchists under criminal statutes, a federal judge ruled that they could not do so\nwithout probable cause that the immigrants were engaged in illegal acts. That became a\nproblem, because Palmer and Hoover went after many people simply for their affiliation\nwith anarchist, communist, and socialist groups. To continue their quest against\nimmigrants, Palmer and Hoover got creative and decided to deport their subjects. On\nNovember 7, 1919, the two-year anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, Palmer began\nrounding up immigrants. By the time he finished, over 10,000 were arrested, 3,500 were\ndetained, and 556 were deported. In retrospect, Palmer overre-acted. His quest for\n38\nrevenge against anarchists would lead the United States on a path of xenophobia,\nnativism, and racism against immigrants. It would also usher in the Red Scare, an\nintense fear of Communist takeover among Americans. Groups such as the American\nCivil Liberties Union strongly objected to the treatment doled out, in many cases to\nindividuals who were likely innocent (Murray, 1955; Irons, 1999).\nDespite the excessiveness of the Palmer Raids in 1919, Palmer and Hoover\u2019s fear of\nanarchists as a violent threat was confirmed yet again in 1920 when terrorists bombed\nNew York City. Galleani\u2019s followers, still angry and armed with dynamite, planted a\nhorse drawn carriage, filled with explosives, in front of J.P. Morgan\u2019s bank on Wall\nStreet. The cart exploded, killing 38 people and injuring more than 400 (Gage, 2010).\nThe BOI became the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1935, with Hoover serving as\nits director until 1972; as history would prove, he never lost his zeal for investigating\nsuspected radicals and subversives.\n39\nWorld War I to Pearl Harbor\nImmediately after World War I, the United States realized that it needed to enhance its\nintelligence capabilities. By this time, America had developed the ability to intercept\ndiplomatic communications, but a problem remained: most messages were coded. To\nsolve the dilemma, the State Department and military collaborated on a project officially\nnamed the Cipher Bureau, but generally referred to as the \nBlack Chamber\n. Headed by\ncryptanalyst Herbert O. Yard-ley, the Black Chamber decrypted the message traffic of\nforeign governments, \nto include those of the Japanese diplomatic service; this provided\nthe United States with a negotiating edge during the 1922 Washington Conference\n(Hannah, 1981). Despite its success, the Black Chamber lasted only until 1929. In shutting\nit down, Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson famously remarked that \u201cgentlemen don\u2019t\nread each other\u2019s mail,\u201d once again underscoring America\u2019s seeming repugnance toward\nintelligence (Knowledgerush, n.d.).\nDespite Yardley\u2019s work overseeing the Black Chamber, the United States was a novice\nin the field of intelligence. President Woodrow Wilson developed a hobby-like obsession\nwith cryptology, finding time in his evenings to create his own code, which could be\neasily broken by comparatively novice codebreakers, like Yardley. The United States was\nin an awkward phase; it possessed wealth that countries like Great Britain and France\ndesperately sought during World War I, and the United States\u2019 involvement in the war\nmeant an influx of capital, steel, and oil, all commodities the Allies needed to win the\nwar. Yet, the United States was an amateur at the table of diplomatic relations. It had\nhardly any intelligence capability to speak of and possessed an immature understanding\nof wartime negotiations. Germany took advantage of the United States\u2019 weaknesses\nwhen it sent the famous Zimmerman Telegram to Mexico. In the telegram, Germany\npromised to giftparts of the Western United States to Mexico, if Mexico would join\nGermany in the war. British intelligence intercepted the telegram and presented it to the\nAmericans. Upon reading it, Wilson knew there was no turning back; the United States\nwas forced to enter the war. Luckily, Americans found success in World War I, and by\nthe end of the war, the United States was elevated to a new global position. It had\ncapital, wealth, and commodities; it had helped win a major world war; and yet, it still\nrefused to create a permanent peacetime intelligence agency. In 1929, Secretary of State\nHenry Stimson shut down Yardley\u2019s Black Chamber, which had retained a small\ncodebreaking office in the Department of State. His decision would later haunt him, as\nAmerica would soon see the need to establish an intelligence arm to fight in World War\nII.\nIn 1929, however, the United States was focused on one thing: the Great Depression.\nThe collapse of the stock market in 1929 presented an unprecedented challenge for\ndemocracy. During that time, the United States watched apprehensively as Communism\n40\ncontinued in the Soviet Union and fascism overtook Italy and Germany. Advocates of\nboth forms of government campaigned for a change within the United States. During\nthat time, America saw its democratic government threatened, both by Communism and\nfascism as well as abject poverty\u2014the collapse of the stock market proved, to some, that\ndemocracy had overstayed its welcome. Interestingly, during a time in which democracy\nwas most under threat, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt opted to secure democracy\nnot through intelligence or military \nmeans, but through social means, found in the\nfinancial relief of the New Deal, a social agenda that provided jobs and welfare to\nmillions of Americas (Katznelson, 2013). The Great Depression would mark the last time\nthat the United States answered a threat to democracy with something other than\nintelligence gathering or military action.\nFigure 2.2\n \nJ. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Bureau of Investigation, later renamed the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, from 1924 until 1972. (Source: FBI)\nBy the late 1930s, Germany\u2019s Adolf Hitler was making his way across Central Europe,\nand World War II had begun. In the early days of the war, Roosevelt had mixed feelings\nregarding intelligence. On the one hand, he directed FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (\nFigure\n2.2\n) to aggressively investigate \nthe German American Bund, Asians, Communists, and\n41\nsubversives in the United States and Latin America. However, he was less than\naggressive, and at times disinterested, when it came to other types of collection. With\nimproving technology, signals intelligence (SIGINT) was becoming a viable way to\nmonitor a potential enemy\u2019s communications. Roosevelt, however, seemed reluctant to\npursue it in any sustained manner. This would prove disastrous; had America been able\nto break the Japanese naval code, it is entirely possible that forewarning of the\nimpending Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor could have been provided. As it turned out,\nthe bombing on December 7, 1941, took America by surprise. The Navy had collected\nSIGINT related to Japanese communications in the form of MAGIC codes. Yet, the Navy\ndid not have much of an interest in codes and placed low priority on decrypting the\nmessages. After the Japanese attack against Pearl Harbor, the United States awoke to the\nfact that it needed an intelligence apparatus, yet again. Then-Secretary of Defense Henry\nStimson, the same man who had shut down Black Chamber twelve years earlier, would\nfind that the reading of others\u2019 mail was, in fact, a necessity (Andrew, 1996).\n42\nWorld War II\nEven though the Pearl Harbor attack came as a shock, the United States had been\npreparing for war for some time. Even before the attacks, Roosevelt realized that he\nneeded better intelligence but faced several obstacles. Chief among these was the\nfragmented nature of the American intelligence enterprise. Disparate agencies, such as\nthe FBI and the military, rarely worked together and generally did not share\ninformation. In mid-1941, Roosevelt created the position of \nCoordinator of Information\n(COI)\n, whose mission was to better integrate intelligence among agencies and to\nencourage information sharing, not an easy task given the often competitive relationship\nthat existed. As the first COI, Roosevelt chose William \u201cWild Bill\u201d Donovan, a Medal of\nHonor recipient, successful lawyer, prosecutor, and diplomat.\nBy 1942, it had become clear that the Office of the COI needed to expand to support\nthe war effort. Reappointing Donovan to the Army, Roosevelt placed him in charge of a\nnew organization, the \nOffice of Strategic Services (OSS)\n. The OSS was a true\nintelligence service. At its height, it boasted 24,000 employees and a budget exceeding\n$10 million. During the war, OSS operatives engaged in all sorts of operations. They\ntrained and equipped underground movements, inserted spies into enemy territory to\ngather information, and engaged in sabotage.\nOn the home front, the FBI investigated suspected foreign spies and saboteurs. One of\nits most famous cases was the capture of members of the Nazi \nOperation Pastorius\n ring,\nwho had landed on the beaches of Long Island, hoping to destroy American factories and\neconomic targets.\nFigure 2.3\n \nThe Enigma machine. (Source: National Security Agency)\n43\nThe Bureau also operated the \nSpecial Intelligence Service (SIS)\n during the war.\nBecause the CIA did not yet exist, the United States needed an intelligence arm to\nmonitor the large German population in Central and South America, many of whom\nwere sympathetic to the German cause. In due course, hundreds of Special Agents were\nassigned south of the border to keep track of potential spies and saboteurs. According to\nthe FBI:\nBy 1946, [the SIS] had identified 887 Axis spies, 281 propaganda agents, 222 agents smuggling strategic war\nmaterials, 30 saboteurs, and 97 other agents. It had located 24 secret Axis radio stations and confiscated 40 radio\ntransmitters and 18 receiving sets. And the FBI had even used some of these radio networks to pass false and\nmisleading information back to Nazi Germany. (Federal Bureau of Investigation, n.d.(a))\nIntelligence proved critical to the war effort. One of the allies\u2019 greatest successes was the\nbreaking of the sophisticated Nazi cipher that was generated on its \u201cenigma\u201d machines\n(see \nFigure 2.3\n). Dubbed \nProject Ultra\n, cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park in England, led by\nAlan Turing, the creator of the modern computer, worked feverishly to decode as many\nGerman messages as possible \n(Hodges, 1983). Shrouded in great secrecy so as not to alert\nthe Germans that their code had been broken, the Project Ultra messages proved crucial\nin assisting the allies with operations throughout the war. Allied code-breakers also\nmanaged to break the Japanese \u201cPurple\u201d code, which assisted in gaining victories in\nnaval engagements in the Pacific.\nDue in part to the OSS\u2019s somewhat dubious success, President Harry S. Truman\ndisbanded the organization after the war. Donovan was an intelligence klutz,\naccidentally leaving a briefcase full of classified documents at a cocktail party in\nBucharest. He was known for promoting based upon an \u201cold boy\u201d network of Ivy League\nfraternity men rather than merit. Although he sent his agents all over the world, he did\nnot always keep tabs on them. In one instance, he detached men to Liberia and forgot\nabout them; in another instance, he mistakenly sent paramilitary agents into neutral\nSweden (Andrew, 1996). Despite Donovan and the OSS\u2019s deficiencies, both President\nTruman and Congress believed that the United States needed a permanent intelligence\nagency beyond that provided by the military. Even though the world was technically at\npeace, it had become a dangerous and complicated place. With both sides soon to be\narmed with weapons that could wreak unfathomable harm, a new type of war was about\nto emerge. Unlike the \u201chot\u201d one that had just concluded, this one would be fought with\nspies on \u201cproxy\u201d battlefields. The role of intelligence was about to achieve a level of\nimportance unprecedented in American history.\n44\nThe Cold War\nThe world\u2019s first Communist state, the Soviet Union, was formed through revolution in\n1917. In just about every way, the values of Communism and those of capitalism stood in\nsharp contrast. Of great concern to the West was the notion that the Communist\nrevolution was an ongoing enterprise\u2014 it would not cease until all nations of the world\nhad been \u201cliberated\u201d and brought within the Communist sphere of influence.\nEven before the end of World War II, Western nations realized that they would soon\nbe in competition with their ally. This point was driven home forcefully in a series of\nconferences in which Allied leaders planned the post-war world. At the end of the day,\ncountries in Eastern Europe were ceded to the Soviets, whereas those in the West fell\nunder the influence of democracies. Germany was divided in half, with West Germany\ngoing to the West and East Germany falling under the Communists. The capital city of\nBerlin, which was geographically located inside East Germany, was likewise divided in\nhalf, featuring democratic West Berlin and Communist East Berlin.\nThe United States did not wait until the end of the war to begin gathering intelligence\non the Soviets. In 1943, the U.S. Army, working with British intelligence, initiated an\naggressive SIGINT operation called \nProject Venona\n, which monitored Soviet\ncommunications until 1980. Among other things, Venona provided information that a\nNew York City\u2013based espionage ring had provided atomic secrets to the Soviets,\nallowing them to deto-nate an atom bomb in 1949. Venona would provide the FBI with\nevidence needed to prosecute husband-and-wife team Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for\npassing along atomic secrets. Because of the secret nature of the cables and the fact that\nthe FBI refused to reveal the source for its top-secret information, some Americans began\nto question whether the government really had the evidence needed to prosecute alleged\nCommunists. The declassification of Venona cables in recent years has supported the\ngovernment\u2019s contention that many of the accused truly did have connections to\nCommunism (Schrecker, 1998).\nOne of the first memorable events of the \nCold War\n came in a 1946 speech delivered\nby Winston Churchill in Fulton, Missouri, in which he declared that an \nIron Curtain\nhad descended over Europe, dividing the \u201cfree\u201d countries from those controlled by the\nCommunists. The phrase \u201cIron Curtain\u201d would resonate for the next 40 years, signifying\nthat the world had become bipolar, with two opposing philosophies seeking to expand\ntheir spheres of influence over nonaligned \u201cthird world\u201d countries.\nIn 1946, the Deputy Chief of the U.S. Mission in Moscow, George Kennan, articulated\nin his \u201c\nLong Telegram\n\u201d what came to be America\u2019s strategy for dealing with the\nSoviets; rather than trying to work with them or confront them in battle, a more realistic\ngoal was to \u201ccontain\u201d their expansion. The philosophy of \ncontainment\n would guide U.S.\nforeign policy throughout the Cold War, directing intelligence and diplomatic efforts and\n45\nprodding America into two major military actions and several conflicts. Though Kennan\noriginally intended his plan for containment to apply to Soviet expansion within Europe,\nthe theory would later extend worldwide, providing justification for American\ninvolvement in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and in covert coups in Latin America\n(Craig & Logevall, 2012).\nBy 1949, the Soviets had developed their own atomic bomb, in no small measure as the\nresult of secrets passed by U.S. spies, such as the \nRosenberg Spy Ring\n (see \nFigure 2.4\n).\nWith both sides possessing nuclear weapons, direct military confrontation embodied the\nintelligence community and the defense sector\u2019s greatest fears. Prior to the introduction\nof the atomic bomb, the world had witnessed the implementation of new military\ntechnology into modern warfare. In other words, there was every reason to think that\natomic warfare would simply become the norm for warfare (Gaddis, 2006). Luckily, \nboth\nthe Americans and the Soviets recognized the costs and implications associated with\nincorporating atomic bombs and weaponry into warfare. They were extremely hesitant\nto rely upon atomic power, and they placed great emphasis on intelligence as a means of\ndeterrence against military action. The role of intelligence for both nations and their\nalliances gained even greater importance. As the United States and the Soviet Union\nraced to develop and stockpile nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons, the world\nbalanced on the edge of another global conflict. The United States adopted the military\nstrategy of \nMutually Assured Destruction\n, in which each side was deterred from going\nto war, lest both be destroyed in the process.\nFigure 2.4\n Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. (Source: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division\n46\nWashington, D.C.)\nOver the next 40 years, the Cold War would prove to be a conflict of \u201cproxy\u201d wars, to\ninclude conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. In addition to actual combat, both\nsides engaged in a war of propaganda, in which they \nhurled rhetoric against each other,\nattempting to solidify their position with their allies while drawing the favor of\nnonaligned countries. It was a diplomatic war, where such heralded foreign policy\nventures as the Marshall Plan had at their core the goal of strengthening allies to make\nCommunism unattractive to their citizenry. Finally, it was an intelligence war, with both\nsides spying on each other and conducting covert operations in increasingly aggressive\nways. Occasionally, the Cold War threatened to become \u201chot,\u201d with events such as the\nCuban Missile Crisis. In a very real sense, the Cold War gave birth to the U.S.\nintelligence infrastructure.\nNational Security Act of 1947\nAfter World War II, Congress and the President Truman realized that they could no\nlonger place a low priority on intelligence. At the same time, Truman was concerned\nthat an overly powerful intelligence infrastructure could damage liberty and privacy. He\nbelieved that the OSS was too powerful for peacetime and that a civilian agency should\nbe established. He decided instead to appoint a \nDirector of Central Intelligence (DCI)\nto oversee events. As a further step, the Congress passed the \nNational Security Act of\n1947\n, an extremely important piece of legislation that created the CIA, the Department\nof Defense, and the \nNational Security Council\n as well as established laws relating to\nintelligence collection and covert activities. To keep the CIA from becoming too\npowerful, two very important restrictions were placed upon it: (1) it was not given law\nenforcement powers, and (2) it was mandated to operate primarily outside the United\nStates. The adoption of the National Security Act of 1947 was an important rite of\npassage for the United States, as it signaled a departure from the country\u2019s earlier\nisolationism. President Eisenhower would later voice his fears of the creation of a\n\u201cmilitary industrial complex,\u201d a structure that allowed for constant war vigilance. In\nmany ways, the years after World War II solidified the United States\u2019 new approach to\nnational security (Hogan, 2000).\nEarly Days of the CIA\nBy 1947, it was clear that the intent of Communism was to spread its influence around\nthe world. In Italy, Communism was gaining popularity. The western IC worried that\nthe Communists might prevail in the 1948 Italian elections, extending the reach of the\n\u201cIron Curtain\u201d to the Mediterranean. To counter this threat, the CIA engaged in one of\nits first major covert actions, funneling large sums of cash to the opposition party and\n47\nauthoring letters and anticommunist books. The CIA-backed Christian Democrats won,\ngiving the CIA an early Cold War victory (Weiner, 2006).\nThe success of the Italian operation emboldened American policymakers; another\nmajor challenge came in Iran, where the popularly elected Prime Minister Mohammed\nMosaddeq threatened to nationalize the oil companies inside that country that belonged\nto Britain. Distraught over this prospect but unable to do anything themselves, the\nBritish approached the Truman administration in the hopes that the United States would\nsee this as a way to deter Communism and intervene. Although President Truman was\ncool to the idea, his successor, Dwight Eisenhower, had no such qualms.\nIn 1953, Mosaddeq was overthrown in a coup engineered by the CIA in what was\ntermed \nOperation Ajax\n. His successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was a member of the\nIranian royal family and, understandably, a great fan of the United States. Better known\nin the West as the Shah of Iran, Pahlavi was a friend to America throughout his reign,\nwhich lasted until 1979. However, he was also an absolute and tyrannical monarch and\nemployed a fearsome secret police force known as the SAVAK. This proved wildly\nunpopular with many Iranians, who did not soon forget the United States\u2019 complicity in\nthe overthrow of their democratically elected government. By the late 1970s, the stage\nwas set for yet another coup in Iran. This time, however, the people rose up against the\nShah and replaced him with a popular Shiite Muslim cleric, the Grand Ayatollah\nRuhollah Mousavi Khomeini, who had been exiled years before. Khomeini shared his\ncountrymen\u2019s disdain for the United States, turning a once strong ally into a bitter foe\nvirtually overnight (Kinzer, 2004).\nThroughout this period, the CIA was busy confronting Communism throughout the\nworld. As had happened in Iran, the democratically elected President of Guatemala,\nJacobo Arbenz Guzm\u00e1n, contemplated redistributing foreign wealth to his citizens.\n\u201cRedistribution of wealth\u201d sounded a great deal like Communism to the Eisenhower\nadministration, which once again turned to covert action, staging a coup against\nGuzman in 1954. The operation turned into a farce, with horrendously poor planning\nand sloppy execution. Nevertheless, it succeeded. By the mid-1950s, it appeared that\ncovert operations were providing America with a significant strategic advantage.\nHowever, as future years would demonstrate, these actions could become a double-edged\nsword; even when they succeeded in the short term, as in Iran, their long-term effects\ncould prove quite damaging (see Cullather, 1999).\nKorean War\nLike many other countries, Korea was divided in two after World War II, with a\nCommunist North and a democratic South. This relationship, however, proved difficult.\nOn June 25, 1950, North Korean forces invaded the South in a surprise attack, hoping to\nunify the country under Communist rule. As \nit had with Pearl Harbor, the IC missed\nmany signals of an impending invasion and incorrectly concluded that the South would\n48\nbe able to withstand an onslaught from the North.\nThe United Nations, led by the United States, condemned the attack and committed\ntroops to fight the North. The Korean War, which lasted until 1953, was the first \nproxy\nwar\n or so called \u201cpolice action\u201d in which the United States and the Soviet Union\nindirectly confronted one another; it would not be the last. The conflict, which ended in\na stalemate, pointed out significant gaps in U.S. intelligence, which included failures that\ndirectly influenced the decision of Communist China to enter the conflict against the\nUnited States and the United Nation\u2019s forces.\nCreation of the National Security Agency\nThe 1940s and 1950s witnessed significant technological advances in communications. In\naddition, Project Ultra had convinced the United States of the value of SIGINT.\nConsequently, in 1949, the military established the Armed Forces Security Agency\n(AFSA), whose primary mission was to intercept and analyze foreign SIGINT. However,\nduring the Korean War, it soon became clear that AFSA was not up to the task; by 1952,\nit had been replaced by the National Security Agency (NSA), a super-secret organization\nwhose mission was strictly SIGINT. By the end of the Cold War, both SIGINT and\nimagery intelligence (IMINT) played a huge role in gathering intelligence about the\nSoviets and their allies. In large part, this had to do with the organizational structure of\nthe Soviet Union. With its large militaries and massive bureaucracies, the Soviets needed\nto communicate constantly to maintain command and control (SIGINT). As well, the\nUnited States could easily count Soviet tanks and ships from the air and could thereby\nkeep a close eye on the military capabilities of its number one adversary (IMINT) (Burns,\n1990).\nEvolution of IMINT\nAs the United States entered the Cold War, it had little in the way of an IMINT\ncapability; the best America could do was to refurbish old bombers and fly them near the\nSoviet border or into Soviet airspace. President Eisenhower, who had used SIGINT and\nIMINT extensively as a military commander, was thoroughly dissatisfied with this\nsituation.\nTo fix the problem, he commissioned the construction of a special plane designed\nspecifically for spying. Dubbed the U-2, the first prototype aircraftflew in 1955. The U-2\nwas an exceptional plane for its day, flying upwards of 70,000 feet and equipped with\nsophisticated cameras.\nNot wishing to provoke a military response in case of an accident, Eisenhower turned\nthe U-2 over to the CIA instead of the military. However, the majority of individuals\ncapable of flying such a difficult and sophisticated aircraftwere, in fact, Air Force or\n49\nNavy pilots. To alleviate the problem, military pilots temporarily resigned their\ncommissions and joined the CIA; this was a procedure that became known as \u201csheep\ndipping.\u201d\nThe U-2s began their missions in the mid-1950s, flying directly over the Soviet Union\nand providing excellent photographs. However, on May 1, 1960, a U-2 piloted by \nFrancis\nGary Powers\n was shot down by a missile near Sverdlovsk in the Soviet Union. This\nincident provided the Soviet Union with an excellent stage upon which to grab the\nattention of the world\u2014the United States had been caught spying. The Eisenhower\nadministration belatedly admitted its culpability in the affair, provoking condemnation\nfrom the Communist bloc countries.\nThe U-2 program would continue for several years, during which time it produced\nmuch valuable data. Sensing that satellites were the ultimate IMINT platform, the United\nStates began work on the Corona program, which was operational by 1960. At the same\ntime, it developed a sort of space-plane called the SR-71, which flew higher, faster, and\nfarther than the U-2.\nToday, the term IMINT has been replaced by GEOINT (geospatial intelligence). Both\nthe National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office\nhave responsibility for U.S. satellites, which are responsible for much of the GEOINT\ngathered today.\nCuba\nIn 1956, Communist revolutionary Fidel Castro led a group of 82 people in an assault on\nthe island of Cuba, hoping to stage a popular uprising. Against all odds, he succeeded.\nCuba is only 90 miles from Florida, and the thought of a staunch, dedicated Communist\nally in America\u2019s backyard alarmed the Eisenhower administration. Cuba became a\nfocus of the U.S. IC, and getting rid of Castro, either by assassination or coup, became a\npriority.\nIn 1960, the CIA began training and funding a group of Cuban exiles to invade the\nisland with the hope of sparking a popular rebellion. In hindsight, the plan was fraught\nwith miscalculations, poor planning, and unwarranted assumptions. For one thing, it was\nassumed that the Cuban people would back an invading force and rise up against Castro.\nBy the CIA\u2019s own admission, it failed to organize sufficient internal resistance;\nultimately, the majority of the citizenry sided with Castro. In addition, the Cuban\ngovernment had learned about the planned invasion and took steps to respond.\nOn April 15, 1961, a group of American B-26 bombers, flown by exiles and disguised\nto look like aircraftof the Cuban Air Force, attacked military airfields in Cuba. On April\n17, approximately 1300 exiles came ashore on a beach at the mouth of Bah\u00eda de\nCochinos, or the \nBay of Pigs\n.\nThe invasion soon failed. The initial airstrikes had been largely ineffective; the\nKennedy administration, fearful that its hand in the operation would be revealed,\n50\ncanceled subsequent ones. Assisted by the mostly intact Cuban Air Force and thousands\nof civilian volunteers, the Cuban Army defeated the invaders within three days (Higgins,\n1987, 2008). The event would serve as a huge intelligence failure that led to the creation\nof the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The DIA did not replace the intelligence\nservices of the armed forces; rather, its mission included collecting, analyzing, and\nintegrating intelligence and advising the Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint\nChiefs of Staff in matters pertaining to military intelligence. The Pentagon hoped that\nDIA could integrate intelligence from the various branches within the military, a dire\nneed that the Bay of Pigs illuminated.\nThe Bay of Pigs did not end covert activities against Cuba. In 1961, the President\napproved Operation Mongoose, a series of secret programs including propaganda,\npsychological warfare, and sabotage, designed to topple the Castro regime by 1962\n(United States Department of State, 1962).\nCovert activities against Cuba convinced the Soviets and Castro that the United States\nwould never waver in its quest to topple the government. In order to guard against that,\nand to give the Soviets a strategic advantage in the western hemisphere, Soviet leader\nNikita Khrushchev ordered nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles placed in Cuba in\nearly 1962.\nThe first reports of offensive missiles in Cuba came to the IC through human sources.\nHowever, those reports were primarily from ordinary citizens who had little knowledge\nof missile technology; as a result, the information was largely ignored. On October 14,\nhowever, the IC uncovered hard evidence\u2014a U-2 photographed a site in western Cuba\nthat clearly showed the presence of Soviet nuclear missiles (Library of Congress, 1996)\n(see \nFigure 2.5\n).\nFor the next several days, the Kennedy Administration debated courses of action. The\noptions considered ranged from complete inaction to mounting an all-out invasion of the\nisland. Finally, the administration forwarded a series of stern warnings to the Soviet\ngovernment and installed a naval quarantine around the island. The Soviets finally\nagreed to remove the missiles if the United States agreed to not invade Cuba, an offer the\nUnited States accepted. More quietly, the United States also agreed to remove its own\nnuclear missiles from Turkey.\n51\nFigure 2.5\n Photo of Russian missiles in Cuba. (Source: U.S. Air Force)\nCuba illustrates both the benefits and limits of intelligence. Despite the best efforts of\nthe United States in the early 1960s, Castro remained in power. Cuba today is one of the\nfew remaining Communist states; the United States has only recently extended an offer\nfor reconciliation with Cuba. In 2015, the Department of State removed Cuba from its list\nof state-sponsors of terrorism and reestablished its embassy in Havana. (United States\nDepartment of State, 2015). The \nCuban Missile Crisis\n, however, remains a shining\nintelligence success in the history of the United States\u2019 intelligence community. The\nintelligence provided to the President during the crisis was crucial in bringing about a\npeaceful solution that avoided nuclear war and allowed the United States to maintain a\nstrategic advantage in its own backyard.\nVietnam Era\nEven as America remained preoccupied with Cuba, another threat materialized half a\nworld away.\n1\n France had established Vietnam as a colony in the mid-nineteenth century.\nWith the end of World War II, France again attempted to reassert control over the\ncountry, which produced significant amounts of tobacco, tea, coffee, and indigo.\nHowever, by the early days of the Cold War, a burgeoning nationalist movement led by\nHo Chi Minh was expanding its power base in the north. French forces fought Ho\u2019s\nSoviet-backed army, the Viet Minh, until their eventual defeat in the siege at Dien Bien\nPhu in 1954. After that, a truce was negotiated, with the country divided into the\nCommunist North and an empire in the South under the control of Prime Minister Ngo\n52\nDinh Diem.\nThe 1954 truce, however, did not end hostilities. A guerilla army in the North, the\nVietcong, began attacks on Diem\u2019s government in the hope of overthrowing it and\nreuniting the country under Ho. Diem attempted to maintain control; as part of his\nstrategy, he clamped down severely on Buddhists, whom he believed were attempting to\nundermine his reign.\nInitially, the United States supported Diem, primarily because of his opposition to the\nCommunist North. America began supplying military advisors to assist the South\nVietnamese in the 1950s. Gradually, the number of advisors, and American involvement,\nincreased.\nDiem\u2019s mistreatment of Buddhists and his lethargy in confronting the North finally\nconvinced the Kennedy administration to support a coup to topple him; the CIA\ndisagreed with this strategy, but was overruled. In 1963, Diem was removed from power;\nhe was subsequently executed, much to the consternation of the administration, who\nnow felt an obligation to continue its activities in Vietnam.\nAt first, military estimates regarding the defeat of the North were quite optimistic.\nAgain, the CIA disagreed; it had information that convinced analysts that the Vietcong\nand the North Vietnamese Army were a better fighting force than assessed by the\nmilitary. Following the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, the Johnson\nadministration continued the buildup in Vietnam. By 1965, regular U.S. forces were\ndeployed to engage directly in the fighting. At the height of the war, more than one-half\nmillion U.S. troops were deployed to Vietnam; by war\u2019s end, America had suffered more\nthan 56,000 casualties and a divided home front.\nThroughout the Vietnam conflict, both the military and the CIA conducted numerous\ncovert operations, in some cases crossing into neighboring countries. Furthermore, CIA\nanalysts correctly predicted the Tet Offensive, which proved to be a military disaster but\na public relations victory for the North.\nThe Vietnam War ultimately proved highly unpopular with the American people. In\n1973, the Nixon Administration signed the Paris Peace Accords, effectively ending direct\nAmerican involvement in the war. However, the North did not cease its aggression. The\nSouth Vietnamese Army continued to resist but the North proved too powerful and with\nthe military support of the United States withdrawn, the South Vietnamese held little\nhope that they could remain independent. On April 30, 1975, the last North Vietnamese\noffensive ended as Saigon fell, and the world witnessed North Vietnamese tanks burst\nthrough the gates of the U.S. Embassy; America\u2019s war in Indochina was over.\nWar at Home\nThe 1960s and early 1970s were an extremely disruptive period in the United States. The\nunpopular Vietnam War gave rise to terrorist groups such as the Weather Underground,\nwhich attempted to spark violent revolution (Burroughs, 2015). However, even before\n53\nthis, law enforcement groups were focused on dissidents and individuals they deemed to\nbe \u201csubversive.\u201d\nThe 1950s gave rise to the \u201cRed Scare,\u201d where accusations of Communist sympathy\ncould ruin a career or subject one to special scrutiny from government agencies. The FBI\nunder its director, J. Edgar Hoover, aggressively investigated individuals whom they\nbelieved served as agents of Communist powers, such as the Soviet Union and China.\nSuch investigations, which rarely resulted in prosecutions, were undertaken for \u201cnational\nsecurity\u201d reasons; their goal was to gather information and thwart plots rather than\narrest individuals after the fact.\nIn 1956, the FBI began a secret program known as \nCOINTELPRO\n (Counterintelligence\nProgram) that initially targeted members of the Communist Party, USA. Rather than\nmerely investigating suspected subversive groups, the Bureau also attempted to disrupt\nand increase factionalism between members. COINTELPRO tactics included infiltration\nand the planting of false information in the media. It also included illegal wiretapping\nand burglaries, termed \u201cblack bag jobs.\u201d\nCOINTELPRO soon extended beyond the Communist Party to include the Ku Klux\nKlan, the Black Panther Party, the American Nazi Party, the new left, women\u2019s rights\ngroups, and certain parts of the civil rights movement. One infamous example of\nCOINTELPRO activity included the bugging of Martin Luther King, Jr. at the order of\nthe Kennedy Justice Department. COINTELPRO activities continued until April 1971.\nIn the 1960s, the CIA conducted its own investigation of suspected domestic dissidents\nand subversives, including members of the Students for a Democratic Society, the Black\nPanther Party, and Women Strike for Peace. The CIA also implemented a program to\nread Americans\u2019 mail. This project, dubbed \nOperation CHAOS\n, was subsequently\njudged to violate the CIA\u2019s mandate of not investigating U.S. citizens. Even the Army\nwas found to have spied on up to 100,000 Americans during the Vietnam War.\nUp to that point, the inner workings of government agencies such as the FBI and CIA\nwere largely secret; few in the United States understood how \ninvestigations and\noperations were conducted. In the 1970s, that changed dramatically. First, on March 8,\n1971, the FBI office in Media, Pennsylvania, was burglarized and several thousand\ndocuments were stolen by a group calling itself the Citizen\u2019s Commission to Investigate\nthe FBI. The stolen documents were turned over to the leftwing press, which published\nmany of them in 1972. For the first time, the public learned of the existence of\nCOINTELPRO and its tactics (Medsger, 2014).\nIn 1975, former Case Officer Philip Agee published \nInside the Company: CIA Diary\n,\ndetailing his experiences in the CIA from 1957 to 1968. Agee\u2019s portrayal of the Agency\nwas not flattering; he accused it of supporting authoritarian governments and engaging\nin assassinations, domestic espionage, and other illegal activities. Those in the CIA were\nfurious and accused Agee of revealing the names of several CIA Case Officers and\nagents, thereby jeopardizing their safety. For his part, Agee chose to live in Cuba, where\nhe died in 2008.\n54\nWatergate and the Church and Pike Committees\nEven as the unpopular Vietnam War wound to a close, the Nixon administration found\nitself embroiled in a controversy that would ultimately destroy it. A botched burglary at\nthe Democratic Headquarters in the Watergate Hotel in 1972 was traced back to the\nWhite House. Ultimately, the President was heard on tape in an apparent attempt to\nobstruct justice; it was also later determined that he tried to have his aides use the CIA\nto stymie the FBI\u2019s investigation of the incident. When it became clear that he would be\nimpeached by the House of Representatives and convicted in the Senate, Richard Nixon\nbecame the first President in American history to resign.\nBy 1974, with the resignation of a President for criminal behavior and the end of a war\nthat bred no end of controversy, trust in the U.S. government was at an all-time low. The\nrevelations regarding COINTELPRO and Project CHAOS soon prompted a series of\ninvestigations by both the executive and legislative branches into the IC. This was an\nunheard-of occurrence; up until the 1970s, there had been modest scrutiny into the\nactivities of the CIA and FBI, which some claim created an environment conducive to\nexcesses and illegal behavior. In the Senate, the \nChurch Committee\n examined whether\nagencies had violated the law, whereas in the House, the \nPike Committee\n tried to\ndetermine whether IC agencies were carrying out their duties effectively and efficiently\n(Haines, n.d.).\nBecause of internal disagreements, the findings of the Pike Committee were never\nofficially released. However, the Church Committee results were published in several\nvolumes in the mid-1970s and proved to be a bombshell. \nEach finding was included in a\nseparate volume; the titles of each are illuminating with regard to what the committee\nfound (Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations, 1976):\nViolating and Ignoring the Law\nOverbreadth [sic] of Domestic Intelligence Activity\nExcessive Use of Intrusive Techniques\nUsing Covert Action to Disrupt and Discredit Domestic Groups\nPolitical Abuse of Intelligence Information\nInadequate Controls on Dissemination and Retention\nDeficiencies in Control and Accountability\nThe Church Committee findings prompted the passage of the \nForeign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act\n (FISA) in 1978. The purpose of FISA was to provide judicial oversight\nover the government\u2019s surveillance of foreign individuals in the United States, while\nmaintaining the secrecy needed to protect national security. The Act regulated electronic\nsurveillance and physical searches and brought the requirements for utilizing each more\nin line with what was required for a criminal wiretap or search warrant. However, to\nprovide for secrecy, FISA also created the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, where\nevery judge had a security clearance and could review classified information. \nChapter 10\n55\n(\u201cConstitutional Mandates\u2014Overview of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Roles\u201d)\nprovides an in-depth look at FISA and other legal matters.\nThe Church and Pike Committees also ushered in an era of increased Congressional\nscrutiny over intelligence activities. Although many find this necessary to ensure that\n\u201crogue elements\u201d within the IC do not emerge to trample civil rights or harm America\u2019s\ninternational reputation, others have been quick to criticize what they see as an\noverabundance of second-guessing and control:\nWhile the old CIA may have been noted for the \u201ccowboy\u201d swagger of its personnel, the new CIA is, in the words\nof one critic, composed of \u201ccautious bureaucrats who avoid the risks that come with taking action.\u201d (Knott, 2001)\nThe Carter Years\nAfter Jimmy Carter was sworn in as President of the United States in 1977, he appointed\nStansfield Turner, a Navy admiral, as the Director of the CIA. Turner had a technical\nbackground and favored SIGINT and IMINT over human intelligence; one of his most\nsignificant, and controversial, actions was to eliminate more than 800 operational\npositions from the agency. At that time, the Soviet Union, China, and their allies were\nseen as the largest \nchallenges facing the United States. To that end, SIGINT and other\ntechnical means of collection made sense; against a smaller, networked enemy, however,\nit is generally recognized that humans provide the best means of collection. In \nBox 4.7\n,\nwe discuss many of the intelligence victories during this period, such as \nOperation Ivy\nBells\n.\nTwo events of great significance occurred during the Carter presidency. First, the Shah\nof Iran, who had been installed in a CIA-backed coup in 1953, had become increasingly\nunpopular among his own people. By 1978, rioting and demonstrations had\noverwhelmed even the brutal SAVAK (secret police) and military. As a result, the Shah\nabdicated the throne and leftIran in early 1979. He was eventually replaced by the\nAyatollah Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini, who shared the Iranian peoples\u2019 enmity for both\nthe Shah and the United States.\nSecond, on November 4, 1979, Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran,\ntaking 53 Americans hostage. The Iran Hostage Crisis, as it came to be known, lasted 444\ndays and became an overriding feature of the Carter presidency. At one point, the\nmilitary attempted a covert rescue operation, Operation Eagle Claw. Although the rescue\nwas unsuccessful, operational, tactical, and intelligence lessons were gained that\ninformed future operations, such as the attempted capture and killing of Osama bin\nLaden in 2011.\nIn another profound event, but one that received less attention at the time in the\nUnited States, the Marxist government of Afghanistan invited the Soviet Army to assist\nit in battling a growing insurgency by an Islamic group made up of \nmujahedeen\n (Islamic\nfreedom fighters). This assistance eventually grew into a war, one which kept the Soviets\nengaged in Afghanistan through 1989.\n56\nThe Reagan Years: End of the Cold War\nRonald Reagan entered the Presidency in 1981 as an unapologetic anti-Communist and a\nstrong supporter of the IC. He appointed another cold warrior, William Casey, as the\nDirector of the CIA; together, they would usher in an era of covert activities and support\nto anti-Communist \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d that was unprecedented and that considerably\nswelled the IC and military budgets before the end of the decade.\nPresident Reagan was also not opposed to using the might of the U.S. military when\nhe deemed it necessary. For example, in 1983, the government of the island of Grenada\nwas toppled by a Communist coup. Although of limited strategic importance, Grenada\nwas home to a medical school attended by many American students. Using the\nprotection of these students as justification, President Reagan ordered American troops\nto invade the island on \nOctober 19, 1983. The U.S. military rescued the students and\ndislodged the government, thereby preventing another Communist state in the\nCaribbean.\nThe Reagan administration used every tool at its disposal to fight Communists. For\nexample, it covertly supported the fledgling \u201cSolidarity\u201d movement in Poland that\nemerged in the early 1980s. However, it had a special interest in Central and South\nAmerica, where it believed the Soviets were attempting to expand their empire. In the\nearly 1980s, the administration recognized an opportunity in Nicaragua, where a group\nof rebels known as the \u201cContras\u201d was attempting to unseat the Marxist Sandinista\ngovernment. What followed was a covert operation that almost brought down the\nReagan presidency. What became known as the \u201cIran-Contra Affair\u201d is further described\nin \nChapter 9\n (\u201cCovert Operations\u201d).\nPerhaps the most successful of all the CIA\u2019s covert activities during this period was its\narming of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan. In the early years of their war against the\nSoviets, the mujahedeen suffered terrible casualties. This was to be expected\u2014rather than\nbeing a well-trained, well-supplied fighting force, they were instead a group of young\nMuslim volunteers who had come from throughout the world to fight the Soviets. Their\nmotivation was to expel an \u201cinfidel\u201d force that had come to attack Islam.\nBy 1986, the CIA was supplying the mujahedeen with heavy machine guns,\nantiaircraft cannon, and\u2014most importantly\u2014Stinger missiles. Up to that point, the\nSoviets had relied heavily on their helicopter gunships, which gave them a distinct\nadvantage in battle. Suddenly, the mujahedeen were shooting Soviet helicopters out of\nthe air. The entire course of the war shifted; on February 15, 1989, the last of the Soviet\ntroops left Afghanistan, weakened, demoralized, and defeated (see, inter alia, Jones,\n2009).\nEnd of the Soviet Union\nGeorge H. W. Bush, who had been Ronald Reagan\u2019s Vice-President for two terms, was\n57\nsworn in as President of the United States on January 20, 1989. Probably no President\nunderstood the IC better than Bush, who had been the Director of the CIA for a year in\nthe 1970s.\nDespite his background, what the President and most experts in the IC failed to realize\nwas that the Soviet Union was in its final days. Even with its huge analytical cadre, the\nIC did not correctly estimate the extent to which the military arsenal and bloated\nbureaucracy was taking a huge toll on the weak Soviet economy. In a blisteringly short\nperiod, between February and September 1989, remarkable freedoms, unthinkable a\ndecade earlier, came to the people under Soviet influence.\nThe most significant of these events occurred on November 9, 1989, when the Berlin\nWall, the ultimate symbol of the divide between East and West, came down. Almost\novernight, the Soviet Union ceased to exist, and Russia and a host of countries emerged\nwith various degrees of independence.\nAt least part of the credit for the peaceful implosion of the Soviet Union has to be\ngiven to its last ruler, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. In an effort to keep the union\ntogether, he had permitted certain freedoms, such as allowing a non-Communist\ngovernment in Poland and opening the Hungarian border with Austria; these acts\nultimately proved contagious. It also appears that the defense buildup and covert actions\nof the Reagan administration may have provided the final nail in the coffin; however, it\nwas not one thing that spelled the end of the Soviet Union, but rather the convergence of\na series of events going back decades.\n58\nEmergence of Terrorism\nWith the fall of the Soviet Union, the bipolar world of the Cold War ended, and a new\nmultipolar world emerged, filled with new dangers and intelligence challenges.\nTerrorism was called the \u201cnew threat,\u201d but it had been around for a long time. Since at\nleast the 1970s, when terrorists from the Palestinian group Black September took the\nIsraeli Olympic team hostage during the Munich Olympics, it had been in the lexicon of\nmilitary, law enforcement, and intelligence professionals.\nMost intelligence and law enforcement agencies describe terrorism as being either\ndomestic or international. The FBI defines international terrorism as that which occurs\nprimarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or is caused by groups\nthat were formed and operate primarily outside of U.S. borders. An example of this type\nof group would be al Qa\u2019ida. Domestic groups, on the other hand, are those that are\nformed and operate primarily in the United States, such as the Ku Klux Klan.\nOver the years, the terrorist threat has waxed and waned; historically, it has been\ntreated primarily as a law enforcement problem. The United States has faced its share of\nterrorists, from the political right and the left, and from inside and outside the country.\nAs America witnessed a new round of terrorism in the 1980s, the threat appeared to be\nprimarily linked to the Middle East, where many opposed the role of the United States in\nthat part of the world and were keen on the destruction of Israel, a staunch U.S. ally.\nAmerica viewed the stability of the Middle East, with its rich energy reserves, as a vital\nnational interest.\nDirect support for Israel sparked the U.S. intervention into Lebanon in the early 1980s.\nIn 1983, the terrorist group \nHezbollah\n conducted suicide \nbombings against the American\nembassy and Marine barracks in Beirut; 241 American service personnel were killed in\nthe barracks bombing. On December 21, 1988, a bomb planted by members of the Libyan\nintelligence service exploded aboard Pan American (Pan Am) World Airways flight 103\nover Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 259 on the plane and 11 on the ground (\nFigure 2.6\n).\nHowever, more quietly, a greater threat was forming among a former ally: the\nmujahedeen who had fought in Afghanistan. In the mid-1980s, a young Saudi named\nOsama bin Laden answered the call for jihad in Afghanistan; he formed an organization,\nthe Maktab al-Khidimat, to recruit Islamic soldiers from around the world for the\nAfghan resistance. After the war, he returned to Saudi Arabia, intent on venting his\noutrage over the fact that the Saudi kingdom had allowed foreign troops to be stationed\nthere; he also criticized his former benefactor, the United States, for a host of reasons.\n59\nFigure 2.6\n \nPan Am 103, Lockerbie, Scotland. (Source: FBI)\nBy 1993, bin Laden was not the only radical Muslim to harbor a strong dislike toward\nthe United States. On February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in the basement of Tower One\nof the World Trade Center in New York City, killing six and injuring 1,040. The\nsubsequent investigation led to a Pakistani \nnamed Ramzi Yousef, the nephew of Khalid\nSheikh Mohammed, who would later help bin Laden plan the 9/11 attacks.\nFigure 2.7\n \nUSS Cole\n, under tow. (Source: Defense Intelligence Agency)\n60\nIn 1992, bin Laden issued his first religious decree (\nfatwa\n) against America. By this\ntime, he had started calling his group \nal Qa\u2019ida\n, Arabic for \u201cthe base.\u201d In 1998, al Qa\u2019ida\nattacked U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam; two years later, a small boat\ncarrying al Qa\u2019ida suicide bombers exploded next to the destroyer \nUSS Cole\n in a Yemeni\nport, killing 17 American sailors (9\u201311 Commission, 2004) (\nFigure 2.7\n).\nBeginning in the 1970s, the IC began to devote increasing resources to the terrorism\nproblem. By the end of the 1990s, there was not a single agency of the IC that was not\nengaged in investigating al Qa\u2019ida and trying to find Osama bin Laden. However, the IC\nwas still configured to fight a Cold War enemy; it had not yet evolved to understand a\nnetworked, stealthy, and very deadly adversary.\n61\nEspionage in 1980s and 1990s\nA well-placed spy can wreak havoc. As a result, the goal of any intelligence service is to\nlearn as much about an opponent as possible while protecting its own secrets. America\u2019s\nfounding fathers understood this, passing the First Espionage Act in 1776, which made\nspying a capital offense.\nOver the years, the United States has not had an unusually large number of its citizens\nturn traitor; however, in the 1980s and 1990s, there were a series of penetrations that\ncompromised a significant amount of sensitive material. In fact, there was so much\nactivity uncovered in 1985, it was dubbed the \u201cYear of the Spy\u201d by the FBI, America\u2019s\nprimary counterintelligence organization (Federal Bureau of Investigation, n.d.(b)). One\nof those arrested that year was young U.S. Navy analyst Jonathan Jay Pollard. Pollard\ndid not work for the Soviet Union or one of its allies, as one might suspect; rather, his\nemployer was Israel, a strong U.S. ally in the Middle East. This provides one of the\ntruisms of intelligence: with few exceptions, everyone spies on everyone else.\nFour other individuals were arrested for espionage in 1985. Two of them spied for the\nSoviet Union, one of them spied for China, and one for Ghana (Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, n.d.(b)).\nTwo of the most devastating spies who ever betrayed the United States did not emerge\nuntil much later. Beginning in 1985, the CIA realized that several of its Soviet agents\nwere disappearing, prompting the agency to suspect that it had a mole, or spy, in its\nmidst. As the CIA attempted to identify the traitor, it approached the FBI for assistance.\nSuspicion soon fell on Aldrich Ames, a Case Officer assigned to CIA Headquarters in\nLangley, who appeared to be living well beyond his means. Deeply in debt in 1985, Ames\napproached the Soviet Union and offered his services, which were readily accepted.\nBecause of his position at Langley, Ames had access to the names of Soviet agents who\nwere spying for the CIA; he turned these over, resulting in the deaths of at least 10\nindividuals. Even as Ames spied for the Soviets, he passed two CIA polygraph\nexaminations, prompting critics to question the effectiveness of the device. Ames and his\nwife, who was complicit in his activities, were arrested in 1994. As part of a plea deal,\nAmes received life in prison while his wife was sentenced to five years (Earley, n.d.).\nWith the arrest of Ames, the IC thought it had found its mole. However, when cases\ncontinued to be compromised and agents lost, the IC knew there was still a significant\nbreach. The arrests of FBI Special Agent Earl Edwin Pitts and CIA Case Officer Harold\nJames Nicholson in 1996 for spying did not stop the leaks, and the search continued. By\n1998, a joint CIA\u2013FBI counterintelligence team had zeroed in on a CIA employee, Brian\nKelley, who turned out to be innocent. By the late 1990s, the FBI, desperate at this point,\napproached a known Russian agent and offered him a huge sum of money to reveal the\nmole. The Russian cooperated and, although he did not know the individual\u2019s name, he\n62\nhad a tape recording of an earlier conversation with the spy. As CIA and FBI personnel\nlistened, they recognized the voice as belonging to FBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen, a\nSoviet specialist assigned to FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C. Hanssen was\nunusually good with \ncomputers; as a result, he gained access to files that should have\nbeen closed to him. Moreover, he had been an FBI agent since 1976 and was recognized\nfor his expertise regarding the Soviet Union; colleagues readily shared information with\nhim.\nThe FBI immediately placed Hanssen under surveillance. On February 18, 2001, he was\narrested near his home in Virginia as he attempted to make a \u201cdead drop\u201d of material for\nhis Russian handlers.\nHanssen\u2019s espionage career lasted 22 years; for all his efforts, he received\napproximately $1.4 million from the Russians. Hanssen inflicted extreme damage,\ndescribed in one official report as being \u201cpossibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S.\nhistory.\u201d He pled guilty for his crimes and was sentenced to life in prison with no\npossibility of parole (Department of Justice, 2002).\nEvery time a spy is caught, the IC reviews and strengthens its security regulations.\nAfter Robert Hanssen\u2019s arrest, regular polygraphs became mandatory for anyone in the\nFBI involved in national security cases. In addition, access to information usually\nbecomes more restricted. Devising better ways to share information while maintaining\nsecurity is one of the major challenges facing the IC today.\n63\nThe Clinton Years\nWilliam J. Clinton was elected to the Presidency with the promise of providing a \u201cpeace\ndividend\u201d to the American people. The Soviet Union was no more, and Clinton\u2019s\npredecessor, George H. W. Bush, had liberated Kuwait from the grip of Iraqi dictator\nSaddam Hussein, thereby establishing America as the \u201cworld\u2019s remaining superpower.\u201d\nClinton soon made good on his promise, reducing the U.S. intelligence budget by 20%.\nHowever, the demise of the Soviet Union did not bring about world peace. Indeed, old\nrivalries rose to the surface, and new ones formed in places such as Somalia, Rwanda,\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, and Haiti. The United States found itself sending\ntroops abroad, not to fight proxy wars, but to engage in \u201cpeacekeeping missions.\u201d\nIn addition, Clinton\u2019s presidency overlapped almost perfectly with the ascendancy of\nIslamic terrorism directed at the United States. The first attack on the World Trade\nCenter came in 1993 with subsequent al Qa\u2019ida attacks on American embassies in Africa\n(1998) and the \nUSS Cole\n in Yemen (2000). However, for much of the decade, American\nlaw enforcement was engaged in combating domestic acts of extremism from a variety\nof sources. The most devastating terrorist attack up to that point on American soil\noccurred on April 19, 1995, when Timothy McVeigh, an Army veteran of the first Gulf\nWar, detonated an ammonium nitrate/fuel oil bomb adjacent to the Murrah Federal\nBuilding in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, destroying it and killing 168 individuals (\nFigure\n2.8\n). McVeigh was angry at the federal government over its handling of a siege outside of\nWaco, Texas, between the FBI and a religious group, the Branch Davidians. After a 51-\nday standoff, the FBI attempted to insert tear gas into the building housing the\nDavidians; shortly after the insertion commenced, a fire broke out, killing 76.\n64\nFigure 2.8\n \nOklahoma City Bombing. (Source: FBI)\nThe FBI found itself squaring off against a variety of domestic threats in the 1990s:\nenvironmental extremists, antiabortionists, militia groups, and \nwhite supremacists. As\nthe threat of terrorism increased, the IC attempted to change itself to meet the challenge.\nAn IC used to dealing with the huge, bureaucratic Soviet Union tried to retool itself to\nconfront a small, highly mobile, dynamic, and tech-savvy foe. Unfortunately, as events\nwould soon show, the fix proved to be too little, too late.\n65\n9/11 and Its Aftermath\nGeorge W. Bush assumed the Presidency in 2001. By that summer, a variety of indicators\nhad convinced terrorism experts in the IC that a huge al Qa\u2019ida event was in its final\nexecution stages. However, most believed it would occur overseas, like the African\nembassy bombings and the attack on the \nUSS Cole\n.\nNo one was prepared for the reality. On September 11, 2001, 19 young Middle Eastern\nmales, soldiers in the al Qa\u2019ida army, boarded four U.S. commercial airliners at airports\non the East Coast of the United States. They brought with them box cutters and other\nweapons that they knew would avoid scrutiny at security checkpoints. Once airborne,\nthe planes were hijacked, with one of the hijackers piloting each plane.\nThe terrorists on three of the planes managed to convince the flight crews, passengers,\nand controllers on the ground that these were \u201croutine\u201d hijackings, done for money or to\nsecure the release of colleagues. However, at 8:46 a.m., American Airlines Flight 11\ncrashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center; some 17 minutes later, United\nAirlines Flight 175 hit the South Tower. Then, at 9:37 a.m., a third plane, American\nAirlines Flight 77, hit the Pentagon. By this time, passengers aboard the final plane,\nUnited Flight 93, had been in contact with friends and relatives on the ground and\nlearned of the fate of the first three planes. The passengers attempted to retake the plane\nfrom the hijackers; after a struggle, United Flight 93 plunged into the ground, outside the\nsmall town of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. It is believed the target of this plane was the\nU.S. Capitol or the White House. In all, 2973 victims and 19 hijackers lost their lives in\nthe \n9/11 attacks\n.\nAs it had been at Pearl Harbor, the IC was caught completely off guard. Overnight,\nmissions and roles changed. Now, terrorism did not compete against other threats for\nattention, it became THE threat. Within two weeks, covert CIA personnel were on the\nground in Afghanistan, al Qa\u2019ida\u2019s sanctuary. They met with opposition leaders and\npaved the way for future military operations that toppled the pro-al Qa\u2019ida Taliban\ngovernment.\nLikewise, the FBI began aggressively investigating anyone who had any conceivable\nconnection to terrorism. They arrested numerous individuals, many for immigration\nviolations; ultimately, al Qa\u2019ida\u2019s leader, Osama bin Laden, took responsibility for the\nattacks.\nIn the wake of the attacks, the \n9/11 Commission\n was convened to determine what\nhad gone wrong; in particular, they sought to determine why a well-funded,\nsophisticated intelligence infrastructure had failed to predict and prevent the most\ndevastating terrorist attacks in the history of America.\nThe commission issued a scathing final report on May 27, 2004. Commission members\nnoted that the measures adopted by the U.S. government between 1998 and 2001 to\n66\nattack al Qa\u2019ida were ineffective; that leaders did not understand the gravity of the al\nQa\u2019ida threat; that the military, CIA, and FBI were not equipped to confront such an\nenemy; and that terrorism was not afforded the proper priority. The commission said\nthat the IC was beset by a \u201cCold War\u201d mentality that would not work against the\nterrorism threat and that organizations did not properly share information (9/11\nCommission).\nThe Commission also had a list of recommendations (\nIbid\n.):\nCreate a national counterterrorism center.\nAppoint a new Senate-confirmed national intelligence director.\nCreate a \u201cnetwork-based information sharing system that transcends traditional\ngovernmental boundaries.\u201d\nSet up a national security unit within the FBI.\nStrengthen Congressional oversight.\nStrengthen the FBI and Homeland defenders.\nEstablish a better dialogue between the West and the Islamic world.\n67\nIntelligence in the Iraq War\nIn 2002, following the 9/11 attacks, the Bush Administration and the intelligence\ncommunity wondered whether Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass\ndestruction. In the past, Hussein had shown little regard for human rights, using\nchemical warfare against Kurds. In 1999, an Iraqi engineer, Ahmed Hassan Mohammad,\ndefected to Germany. In exchange for a green card, he proffered his knowledge of Iraqi\nweapons of mass destruction. Over the course of many months, German intelligence\nagents interviewed Mohammad as he told stories of weapons programs, including a set\nof moving trucks that transported biological weapons. Mohammad\u2019s erratic and hostile\nbehavior led the Germans to classify him as an unreliable source. Nonetheless, American\nintelligence agencies used Mohammad\u2019s unconfirmed intelligence as a primary source\nfor Secretary of State Colin Powell\u2019s presentation before the United Nations in 2003,\nwhen he asserted that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Codenamed\n\u201cCurveball\u201d by the Defense Intelligence Agency, Mohammad\u2019s false intelligence would\nserve as justification for the United States\u2019 2003 invasion of Iraq.\nThe failure of analysis, demonstrated in the elevated importance of Curveball\u2019s\nunreliable account, led to a reform of analytical techniques across the intelligence\ncommunity. The Director of National Intelligence issued directives that forced analysts\nto \u201cproperly [describe] quality and credibility of underlying sources, data, and\nmethodologies.\u201d The mistakes made in relation to Curveball forced the intelligence\ncommunity to confront analytical biases and to think of better ways to conduct analysis,\nrelying upon \nStructured Analytic Techniques\n, otherwise known as formal methods of\nthinking, to overcome bias (Drogin, 2007).\n68\nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\nand Creation of the Director of National Intelligence\nMuch has been done in the wake of the 9/11 attacks to try to deal with terrorism. In\nOctober 2001, the President signed into law the \nUniting and Strengthening America by\nProviding Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of\n2001\n, more commonly known as the \nUSA PATRIOT Act\n. In addition, the government\ncreated a huge bureaucracy, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security\n, which absorbed\nmany existing agencies and created new ones. In addition, America has fought wars in\nIraq and Afghanistan to eliminate their sponsorship of terrorists.\nOf particular interest to the IC, in 2004, President George W. Bush signed the\nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act\n, which incorporated many of the\nrecommendations proposed by the 9\u201311 Commission. Among other things, the act\nestablished the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the National\nCounterterrorism Center, and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.\nThe creation of the DNI position was a huge change for the IC. Historically, the\nDirector of the CIA also served as the DCI, the nominal head of the IC. For years, critics\nhad complained that this gave the CIA an unfair bureaucratic advantage over other IC\nagencies and biased IC findings toward the position of the Agency. In the intelligence\nworld, access to policymakers is all-important. Presidents and others in high positions\nare free to ignore the advice given to them by their intelligence advisors. Therefore, the\nposition of DCI and his influence with the President had an enormous effect on whether\ncertain strategies would be followed and policies implemented.\nThe first DNI was John Negroponte, who was sworn in on April 21, 2005. He was\nfollowed by John McConnell, Dennis Blair, David Gompert (acting), James Clapper,\nMike Dempsey, and, most recently, Dan Coates. Negroponte had served as a career\ndiplomat, whereas McConnell and Blair were both Navy admirals. David Gompert had\nserved in the office of the DNI and had \nworked as a senior policy analyst at the RAND\nCorporation. James Clap-per was a retired Air Force general, while Mike Dempsey was a\ncareer CIA employee and Dan Coates served as a Republican Senator from Indiana.\nIn 2007, the DNI released 100 and 500 Day Plans, which outlined proposed changes\nand reforms for the IC. In addition, the DNI released \nVision 2015\n, a publication that\nspelled out the mission, vision, and strategy of the IC as it navigated the twenty-first\ncentury. Interestingly, \nVision 2015\n identified \u201cpersistent threats and emerging missions\u201d\nfor the IC that went well beyond historic areas of interest (see Director of National\nIntelligence, 2008). They included:\nFailed states\nSpace\n69\nFinancial\nClimate change\nRogue states\nEnergy and natural resources\nRising powers\nInsurgencies\nTerrorism\nCrime\nCounterintelligence\nDrugs\nCyber\nWeapons of mass destruction\nIn addition to the creation of the DNI, the attacks of 9/11 caused various agencies to\nrealign their missions and organizational structure. For example, the FBI reassigned\nmany agents from working traditional crimes, such as bank robbery, to terrorism\nmatters. In addition, the Bureau underwent a major restructuring, forming a National\nSecurity Branch and creating many intelligence analyst positions.\nIt is too early to assess the efficacy of the changes that have occurred in the IC. Some\ncritics have charged that the position of DNI carries with it too little authority, whereas\nothers contend that it has created an elephantine structure that does little to enhance\nsecurity while threatening civil liberties. The current structure of the IC is discussed in\nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d).\n70\nRecent Developments in the Struggle Against Terrorism\nAs this book is being written, significant events have occurred in America\u2019s struggle\nagainst terrorism. Domestically, many potential events have been thwarted as a result of\nthe vigilance of citizens and the efforts of federal, state, \nand local law enforcement\nagencies. Internationally, several senior al Qa\u2019ida leaders have been captured or killed by\nthe military and IC agencies. Under President Barack Obama, U.S. troops have departed\nIraq and made plans to reduce their numbers in Afghanistan.\nMost significantly, the architect of the 9/11 attacks and the world\u2019s number one\nterrorist, Osama bin Laden, was killed in his hideout in Pakistan in May 2011 by U.S.\nforces under the direction of the Obama administration (see \nBox 3.2\n, \u201cThe IC Today\u201d).\nDespite these successes, it is far too early to declare \u201cvictory\u201d in the struggle against\nterror.\nFinally, there were significant \u201cleaks\u201d of classified information by individuals such as\nNSA contractor Edward Snowden and U.S. Army soldier Chelsea Manning. To \u201cseal the\nleaks,\u201d the Obama Justice Department brought charges against numerous \u201cleakers.\u201d\n71\nThe Trump Administration and Its Relationship to the IC\nOn January 20, 2017, Donald J. Trump was inaugurated as the 45th President of the\nUnited States. A controversial figure, he became the first president to have attained the\noffice without ever having held a previous elected position in government. President\nTrump\u2019s early relationship with IC leaders proved contentious, at one point likening\nthem to \u201cNazis\u201d when unsubstantiated reports of alleged misconduct on his part was\nleaked to the press.\nPresident Trump also raised eyebrows when he appointed retired Lieutenant General\nMichael Flynn as his National Security Advisor (NSA). Flynn had previously served as\nthe Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but retired early amid reports that he\nwas an abusive and ineffective leader. Flynn was forced to resign the NSA post 24 days\nafter his appointment, ostensibly because he had misled the Vice President about his\nrelationship with Russia.\nOn May 9, 2017, President Trump once again courted controversy when he fired FBI\nDirector James Comey. The President offered many reasons for the firing, but some\ncritics have charged that it had to do with the FBI\u2019s investigation of alleged collusion\nbetween the Trump transition team and the government of Russia. On May 17, 2017, the\nDepartment of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a Special\nCounsel to oversee the Russian investigation.\n72\nConclusion\nThe U.S. intelligence infrastructure today is a product of its history. Over the years, the\nIC has waxed and waned in importance, depending on the current needs of the country.\nOften, its evolution appears to have been driven by \nfailure, such as the inability to\nprevent the attacks of Pearl Harbor and 9/11. Readers must remember, however, that\npolicymakers play a considerable role in the endeavor\u2014they are the ones who allocate\nresources and dictate threats; in addition, they can ignore the warnings of analysts if\nthey so choose.\nAt best, intelligence is a tricky business. Threats and challenges continue to emerge\nand evolve. In \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d), we discuss the IC as it currently exists. The\nlikelihood that it will remain that way for the next 10 years is doubtful. For example,\nrecent disclosures of IC activities by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden and Army\nPrivate Chelsea Manning compromised many IC programs and altered the manner in\nwhich agencies carry out their duties; we discuss these disclosures in depth in \nChapter 8\n(\u201cCounterintelligence\u201d). In a very real way, the history that is being written today is\ncreating the intelligence world of tomorrow.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nWhy was America\u2019s civilian intelligence effort so slow to start?\n2\n. \nIn the United States, foreign and domestic intelligence operations are sharply\ndivided. Is this a good idea? Why or why not?\n3\n. \nThe history of the IC is one of both success and failure. What factors led to the\nfailures? Are these things that can be permanently fixed, or will there always\nbe intelligence failures?\n4\n. \nHow have spies such as Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen shaped the history\nof the IC?\n5\n. \nIn this chapter, we assert that \u201cthe history that is being written today is\ncreating the intelligence world of tomorrow.\u201d Based on the history of the IC, do\nyou agree with that statement? What other factors will influence the\n\u201cintelligence world of tomorrow?\u201d\n73\nKey Terms\n9/11 attacks\n9/11 Commission\nal Qa\u2019ida\nAnarchists\nBay of Pigs\nBlack Chamber\nBlack Dispatches\nChurch Committee\nCOINTELPRO\nCold War\nCommittee of Secret Correspondence\nContainment\nCoordinator of Information (COI)\nCuban Missile Crisis\nCulper Spy Ring\nDepartment of Homeland Security\nDirector of Central Intelligence (DCI)\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)\nFrancis Gary Powers incident\nHezbollah\nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act\nIron Curtain\nLong Telegram\nMujahedeen\nMutually Assured Destruction\nNational Security Act of 1947\nNational Security Council\nOffice of Strategic Services (OSS)\nOperation Ajax\nOperation CHAOS\nOperation Pastorius\nPalmer Raids\nPearl Harbor attacks\nPike Committee\nProject Ultra\nProject Venona\nProxy War\n74\nRosenberg Spy Ring\nSecret Committee\nSpecial Intelligence Service (SIS)\nStructured Analytic Techniques\nUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required\nto Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act)\nVision 2015\nYear of the Spy\n75\nNote\n1\n References for this section generally are found in Central Intelligence Agency.

At times, intelligence\nhas been a high priority; at other times, it has remained firmly on the back burner.\nWorld War II and the Cold War brought about major changes in the way the\ngovernment gathered and analyzed information; organizations such as the Office of\nStrategic Services (OSS) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) emerged to meet the\nneeds of a nation that felt threatened by its enemies. The attacks of 9\u201311 had a similar\neffect; the government in general and the IC in particular went through a major\nreorganization.\nBecause the changes have been recent, that reorganization continues to this day. It is\nnot an understatement to say that the evolution of the IC is a \u201cwork in progress.\u201d\nAlthough the United States has not suffered another attack on the scale of 9/11, the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century\u2014everything from terrorism to economic instability\nto pandemics\u2014are enormous. Good intelligence plays a key role in meeting those\nchallenges. To do that, however, the community must be situated to meet the threats of\ntomorrow, not those of yesterday.\nA major criticism of the 9/11 Commission, and a great impetus for change, was that,\ndespite the collapse of the Soviet Union, the IC remained organized to wage the Cold\nWar. Adversaries that possess large land armies and great fleets are quite different than\nthose who occupy the shadowy world of the terrorist. The platforms that worked well\nagainst countries\u2014signals intelligence (SIGINT), measurement and signatures\nintelligence (MASINT), and geospatial intelligence (GEOINT)\u2014have less utility when\ndealing with al Qa\u2019ida cells. For example, when the United States made the decision to\ninvade Afghanistan, it discovered that its human sources were woefully inadequate for\nthe task. Developing a reasonable human intelligence (HUMINT) capability takes time\u2014\ngood sources of information must be cultivated and do not spring up overnight.\nBoth the attacks of 9/11 and the IC\u2019s incorrect assessment that Saddam Hussein\npossessed weapons of mass destruction prompted Congress and the Bush Administration\nto establish commissions to determine what went wrong. Both commissions came to\nsimilar conclusions about intelligence. In the words of the Commission on the\nIntelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction\n(the Iraq WMD Commission):\nThe Intelligence Community\u2019s performance in assessing Iraq\u2019s pre-war weapons of mass destruction programs\nwas a major intelligence failure. The failure \nwas not merely that the Intelligence Community\u2019s assessments were\nwrong. There were also serious shortcomings in the way these assessments were made and communicated to\npolicymakers. (Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass\nDestruction, 2005: 46)\n81\nPrompted primarily by the report of the 9/11 Commission, the Intelligence Reform and\nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004 was signed into law that same year. Referred to\ngenerally as IRTPA, this act made sweeping changes to the IC, which are further\ndescribed below.\nIn its response to the threat of terrorism, U.S. intelligence agencies became very\naggressive, especially in terms of collection activities. The series of revelations by former\nIC employees Chelsea Manning and Edward Snowden discussed in this chapter and\nChapter 8\n (\u201cCounterintelligence\u201d) caused significant scrutiny to be directed at IC\nagencies. As a result of classification issues, the extent of the leakers\u2019 damage remains\nunknown to the public; however, in the words of National Security Agency (NSA)\nDirector Admiral Mike Rogers, \u201cIt has had a material impact on our ability to generate\ninsights as to what terrorist groups around the world are doing \u2026 Anyone thinks this has\nnot had an impact \u2026 doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about\u201d (Risen, 2015).\nThe \nSnowden Effect\n has not so much changed the structure of the IC itself; rather, it\nhas affected the relationship between the intelligence community and the private sector,\nprimarily the communications industry. Today, messages and other communications\ntraffic are protected by complex encryption, making them impossible for the IC to read,\neven when legal thresholds are met. In remarks before the Senate Committee on\nHomeland Security and Government Affairs, FBI Director James Comey stated:\nWe live in a technologically driven society, and just as private industry has adapted to modern forms of\ncommunication, so, too, have terrorists. Unfortunately, changing forms of Internet communication and the use\nof encryption are posing real challenges to the FBI\u2019s ability to fulfill its public safety and national security\nmissions. This real and growing gap, to which the FBI refers as \u201cGoing Dark,\u201d is an area of continuing focus for\nthe FBI; we believe it must be addressed given the resulting risks are grave both in both traditional criminal\nmatters as well as in national security matters. (Comey, 2015)\nOn the other side of the issue, groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)\nendorse strong encryption, claiming that it makes everyone safer. In the words of EFF\nStaffAttorney Nate Cardozo:\nWe\u2019re living in a golden age of surveillance. With the advent of cloud services, smart phones, and ubiquitous\nwireless Internet connections, we are \nmore trackable and more of our private lives are online and accessible to\nlaw enforcement than ever before. (Cardozo, 2015)\nWhen we refer to the U.S. IC, we generally mean the 16 federal agencies that report to\nthe \nDirector of National Intelligence (DNI)\n. However, in reality, the actual IC is much\nbroader than that. Envision the IC as a series of concentric circles (see \nFigure 3.1\n). At the\ncenter are the 16 agencies and the DNI; proceeding out one ring, one finds other agencies\nthat have an intelligence capacity. These include other federal organizations, such as the\nSecret Service and the Centers for Disease Control; state agencies, such as the\nDepartment of Home-land Security (DHS) funded fusion centers and state police\norganizations; and local government entities, such as the Los Angeles and New York\nCity Police Departments. Going out yet another ring are private organizations that\nperform intelligence functions for the government as well as private clients.\n82\nFigure 3.1\n \nThe Public and Private U.S. Intelligence World\nSince \nFigure 3.1\n represents only the U.S. intelligence world, one major component we\nhave not included is the intelligence services of allied nations. However, they are quite\nimportant in the big picture\u2014much good intelligence flows from these agencies to the\nUnited States (and vice versa). Although many nations share information with the\nUnited States, four have a particularly close bond: the United Kingdom, Australia,\nCanada, and New Zealand. Collectively, along with the United States, these nations are\nreferred to as \nthe \n5 Eyes\n and routinely share all but the most sensitive intel. Just because\na country is a friend, however, does not mean that it refrains from gathering intelligence.\nConsider the case of Jonathan Pollard, an American analyst who served thirty years of a\nlife sentence in prison for espionage activities on behalf of close U.S. ally Israel. \nFigure\n3.2\n shows the DNI and the agencies that report to him, what most individuals commonly\nconsider \u201cthe IC.\u201d\n83\nFigure 3.2\n Organizational chart of the U.S. Intelligence Community\n84\nDesignated Federal Agencies and the DNI\nDirector of National Intelligence\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) was created by IRTPA in 2004.\nIts head, the DNI, has two primary missions (Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence, n.d.):\nLead intelligence integration.\nForge an Intelligence Community that delivers the most insightful intelligence\npossible.\nIn October 2012, Presidential Policy Directive 19 also gave the DNI the responsibility of\nprotecting IC whistleblowers from retaliation for reporting fraud, waste, and abuse.\nTo accomplish these missions, the DNI set the following goals (Office of the Director\nof National Intelligence, n.d.):\nIntegrate intelligence analysis and collection to inform decisions made from the\nWhite House to the foxhole.\nDrive responsible and secure information-sharing.\nSet strategic direction and priorities for national intelligence resources and\ncapabilities.\nDevelop and implement Unifying Intelligence Strategies across regional and\nfunctional portfolios.\nStrengthen partnerships to enrich intelligence.\nAdvance cutting-edge capabilities to provide global intelligence advantage.\nPromote a diverse, highly-skilled intelligence workforce that reflects the\nstrength of America.\nAlign management practices to best serve the Intelligence Community.\nAs both the mission and goals make clear, one of the chief responsibilities of the DNI is\nto foster collaboration and integration between various intelligence agencies. The\nemphasis on sharing can be traced to the history of the IC itself. Before the creation of\nthe DNI position, the head of the IC was the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), who\nalso served as the head of the CIA. Critics of this arrangement argued that the position\nof DCI gave the CIA extraordinary access and power, to the benefit of the CIA but to the\ndetriment of other agencies. In addition, a spirit of competition rather than collaboration\nexisted between agencies. In 2004, the 9/11 Commission concluded that the position of\nDNI was essential because a lack of intelligence sharing was a chief cause of preventing\n85\nthe attacks (National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004:\n411):\nThe current position of Director of Central Intelligence should be replaced by a National Intelligence Director\nwith two main areas of responsibility: (1) to oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest\nacross the U.S. government and (2) to manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that\ncontribute to it.\nOne of the chief roles that the DNI plays is to try to get IC members to collaborate better.\nAn example of this can be seen with the \nNational Counterterrorism Center (NCTC)\n,\nwhich was created in 2004 and which the \nDNI oversees. The NCTC brings together more\nthan 500 personnel from 16 different agencies in an effort to \u201cmeld\u201d intelligence from\nevery IC entity to address a single problem. As such, it is a \u201cproblem\u201d rather than an\n\u201cagency\u201d centered organization.\nThere is evidence to suggest that the DNI has achieved some success in getting\nagencies to better work together. In a 2011 joint statement before the Senate Committee\non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Zoe Baird Budinger and Jeffrey Smith\nof the Markle Foundation stated:\nA substantial change has occurred throughout government in the way security professionals do business.\nInformation sharing has become more widespread and the government has made real changes that are necessary\nto respond to new threats. (Budinger & Smith, 2011)\nSince 2005, there have been two acting and five permanent DNIs; three have been retired\nsenior military officers. The first permanent appointee to the post was John Negroponte,\na career diplomat who spent many years in the Foreign Service. At the time of this\nwriting, the current DNI is former Indiana Senator Dan Coats, who has served since\n2017. A list of the DNIs and their years of service appear in \nTable 3.1\n.\nTable 3.1\n \nDirectors of National Intelligence and Their Dates of Service\nAppointee\nDates of Service\nJohn Negroponte\nApril 21, 2005\u2013February 13, 2007\nVADM John Michael McConnell, USN (Ret.)\nFebruary 13, 2007\u2013January 27, 2009\nADM Dennis C. Blair, USN (Ret.)\nJanuary 29, 2009\u2013May 28, 2010\nDavid C. Gompert (Acting)\nMay 28, 2010\u2013August 5, 2010\nLt. Gen. James R. Clapper, USAF (Ret.)\nAugust 5, 2010\u2013January 20, 2017\nMike Dempsey (Acting)\nJanuary 20, 2017\u2013March 16, 2017\nDan Coats\nMarch 16, 2017\u2013Present\nSince it was first discussed in Congress, the role of the DNI has not been without\ncontroversy. Prior to approving the position, Congress debated about the role of the DNI\nas well as the amount of power he or she should yield. When the bill creating the office\nwas finally signed into law, it was weaker than many proponents had hoped. For\nexample, the military maintained significant control, including budgetary control, over\nits own agencies. Despite the fact that President Bush signed an executive order in 2008\n86\nstrengthening \nthe DNI\u2019s power, some critics still maintain it is still not strong enough to\ncarry out its duties.\nOn February 9, 2016, DNI Clapper provided a worldwide threat assessment to the\nSenate Armed Forces Committee (Clapper, 2016). In addition to regional threats, such as\nRussia, North Korea, and China, he highlighted a list of other challenges that the IC\ncurrently faces. A quick look at the list should reinforce the idea that Clapper was\ncorrect in his call for collaboration; no single agency has the reach, resources, or\nexpertise to individually deal with each threat:\nCyber and Technology\nTerrorism\nWeapons of Mass Destruction and Proliferation\nSpace and Counterspace\nCounterintelligence\nTransnational Organized Crime\nEconomics and Natural Resources\nHuman Security (this is a general term that refers to such threats as climate\nchange, shortages of water and other resources, health, and forced migration).\nIndependent Agencies: CIA\nFigure 3.3\n \nCIA seal. (Source: CIA)\nThe CIA (\nFigure 3.3\n) is the only independent member of the IC; that is, it reports\ndirectly to the DNI. All other agencies are part of a cabinet-level department and\ntherefore report to their respective secretaries. The National \nSecurity Act of 1947\nestablished the CIA and created the National Security Council. As discussed in \nChapter 2\n(\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d), the realities of the Cold War convinced\nthe United States that it needed a permanent, civilian intelligence organization. As the\nOSS disbanded following World War II, its missions were originally divided between the\nmilitary and the State Department. By 1946, the Central Intelligence Group (the\npredecessor to the CIA) was established and began to assume some intelligence missions.\n87\nThe CIA classifies its budget and number of personnel although one estimate puts its\nstrength at approximately 20,000 individuals (Crile, 2003). Referred to informally as \u201cthe\nAgency\u201d or \u201cthe Company,\u201d the CIA engages in all five areas of intelligence: collection,\nanalysis, counterintelligence, covert activities, and management. It is divided into four\n\u201cdirectorates\u201d that have different missions and functions. The CIA produces intelligence\nabout foreign threats; it has no internal security authority. In its own words, it carries\nout the following mission (Central Intelligence Agency, 2016):\nPreempt threats and further US national security objectives by collecting intelligence that matters, producing\nobjective all-source analysis, conducting effective covert action as directed by the President, and safeguarding\nthe secrets that help keep our Nation safe.\nThe \nDirectorate of Intelligence\n consists of analysts and other personnel who produce\nreports using many different sources of information. Although much of its reporting is\nclassified, the CIA produces a wealth of open source material, such as the \nWorld\nFactbook\n, which can be accessed through the CIA website. The \nNational Clandestine\nService\n, once known as the Directorate of Operations, consists of Case Officers and\nother individuals who gather information (largely HUMINT) in a clandestine manner.\nThey spend a large part of their careers abroad gathering information and carrying out\nother tasks as assigned. The NCS also conducts covert missions. As its name implies, the\nDirectorate of Support\n provides logistical support for operations and is responsible for\nsecurity, communications, information technology, and training. Finally, the \nDirectorate\nof Science and Technology\n is responsible for developing technologies to enhance the\nAgency\u2019s mission. This can range from super-secret eavesdropping devices to the U-2\nspy plane, which the CIA developed in conjunction with the Air Force.\nAficionados of the spy movie genre may think that most CIA Case Officers spend the\nbulk of their time engaged in covert operations, like the fictional James Bond. Although\nit is true that missions can become quite dangerous \nand deadly, most often their\nresponsibilities involve debriefing individuals with information and attempting to recruit\nspies.\nOf course, the attacks of 9/11 had a profound impact on the CIA. Both it and the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) were criticized by the 9/11 Commission for not\ndoing enough to prevent the terrible atrocity. That said, within a short time after the\nattacks, CIA officers were on the ground in Afghanistan, working with the Northern\nAlliance to dislodge the Taliban and capture Osama bin Laden. CIA paramilitary officer\nJohnny Michael Spann was the first American killed in combat during the U.S. invasion\nin 2001.\nMuch of what the CIA has done to stop terrorism remains classified. However, some\ntechniques have been revealed. For example, many Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS)\nand al Qa\u2019ida leaders have been killed or captured as a result of CIA unmanned aerial\nvehicles operating over Afghanistan, Pakistan, and other countries, such as Yemen. One\nof the more controversial techniques the CIA has used is extraordinary rendition, which\nis the abduction of suspected terrorists and their secret transfer to countries that may\n88\nallow them to be tortured. Another tactic that has been questioned is the use of\nenhanced interrogation techniques, such as \u201cwaterboarding,\u201d which some consider\ntorture.\nDepartment of Energy: Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence\nThe Department of Energy (DOE) has expertise for all things nuclear. As a result, its\nOffice of Intelligence and Counterintelligence studies the nuclear capabilities of foreign\ngovernments, to include the assessment of foreign nuclear weapons programs and\nproliferation activities. One of the big issues surrounding the IC today is the acquisition\nof nuclear technology by such non-friendly nations as North Korea and Iran. Some years\nago, a big worry centered around poorly guarded facilities that held the nuclear weapons\nof the former Soviet Union. But nuclear weapons are not the only interests of the DOE. It\nalso looks at radioactive waste and energy security, issues important to future U.S.\nnational security.\nDHS: Office of Intelligence and Analysis\nLike ODNI, the DHS was established in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. However, unlike\nODNI, DHS has 22 agencies that it directly oversees with more than 240,000 employees;\nin fiscal year 2010, its net cost of operations was \n$56.4 billion (United States Department\nof Homeland Security, 2011a). In 2016, Congress enacted a DHS budget of $66.3 billion\n(United States Department of Homeland Security, 2016). The DHS divides its funding\npriorities as follows (United States Department of Homeland Security, 2016):\nPrevent Terrorism and Enhance Security\nSecure and Manage Our Borders\nEnforce and Administer Our Immigration Laws\nSafeguard and Secure Cyberspace\nStrengthen National Preparedness and Resilience\nWithin the headquarters of DHS is its own Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA),\nwhich is overseen by an undersecretary. The OIA sets collection priorities for its\nagencies and analyzes information from a variety of sources. Although some of its\ncomponents are not members of the IC, they still provide vital intelligence. Consider the\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection; the agency is responsible for securing the borders\nand keeping an eye on America\u2019s seaports. Both of these responsibilities directly affect\nnational security.\nOne of OIA\u2019s biggest missions is to ensure that timely intelligence is disseminated to\nfederal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement organizations and the private sector. The\nOIA also distributes funds to state and local agencies; a good part of this goes to help\n89\nfund \nfusion centers\n (described later in the chapter) operated by the state and large\nmunicipalities. Some of its specific intelligence interests include border security;\nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear issues; explosives; infectious diseases; and\ncritical infrastructure protection.\nSince its inception, DHS has been a source of controversy. In a 2015 report by the\nSenate\u2019s Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Senator Tom\nCoburn noted: \u201cBased upon the available evidence, DHS is not successfully executing\nany of its five main missions. Many of DHS\u2019s programs, in fact, are ineffective and\nshould be reconsidered\u201d (Coburn, 2015: 3).\nOf note, Senator Coburn did not lay all of the blame at the feet of DHS. Indeed, he\noffered some positive comments, especially concerning DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson:\nOne of the most significant challenges DHS faces is Congress. Parochial politics and overlapping jurisdiction\nbetween various congressional committees and subcommittees too often hinder and impede DHS\u2019s mission and\nprograms. Reforming DHS, therefore, must begin with changing Congress\u2019s approach to homeland security. The\nDepartment must overcome many \nobstacles, but it confronts each with some great assets, including many of its\nemployees who risk their lives for our security every day. Likewise, Secretary Jeh Johnson has proven to be a\ncapable leader, a transparent partner with Congress, and committed to making tough decisions and improving\nthe Department. (Ibid.: 3\u20134)\nDHS: Coast Guard Intelligence\nThe Coast Guard has both a law enforcement and, in time of war, a military mission. It\nhas had a formal intelligence arm since 1915. One of the Coast Guard Intelligence\u2019s\n(CGI) earliest intelligence efforts was to identify \u201crum runners\u201d who attempted to\nsmuggle illegal liquor into the United States during prohibition.\nToday, \u201crum runners\u201d have been replaced by international drug cartels that also use\nthe waterways to smuggle contraband. In addition, the Coast Guard plays a major role in\nthe fight against terrorism. In 1996, the Coast Guard Investigative Service (CGIS) was\nestablished. The CGIS is an investigative arm of the CGI, responsible for criminal,\ncounterintelligence, and personnel security investigations within the Coast Guard\u2019s area\nof responsibility (United States Coast Guard, 2008).\nDepartment of Justice: FBI\nSince its earliest days, the FBI has been involved in intelligence operations. Readers will\nrecall that a young J. Edgar Hoover led the Bureau of Investigation and other agencies\nduring the Palmer Raids of 1919 and 1920. In addition, the FBI was heavily engaged in\nferreting out German saboteurs and spies operating in both the United States and South\nAmerica during World War II. A major focus of Bureau activities over much of its\nhistory has been tracking subversives, be they Communists, white supremacists,\nmembers of left-wing radical organizations, environmental terrorists, or those who are\nmotivated by a single cause (e.g., antiabortionists).\n90\nUnlike the CIA, which is strictly engaged in intelligence matters, the FBI also has a\nlaw enforcement mission. The Bureau is the federal government\u2019s \u201call purpose\u201d law\nenforcement agency; unlike the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or Bureau of\nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which have narrowly focused missions, the\nFBI investigates more than 200 different matters. As a result, at any given time FBI\nleadership must carefully apportion resources to ensure that important criminal or\nintelligence areas do not get neglected.\nAlong with the CIA, the FBI was heavily criticized by the 9/11 Commission for failing\nto prevent the attacks. Some critics argued that combining law enforcement and\nintelligence within the same agency was a bad idea; they insisted that the cultures of the\ntwo disciplines were too distinct to allow for any one organization to master both.\nProponents of this view favored creating a separate domestic intelligence agency, much\nlike the UK\u2019s MI-5. However, after strong lobbying by then-FBI Director Robert Mueller\n(\nFigure 3.4\n), Congress and the administration decided to leave the FBI intact. As a result,\nit continues to maintain both law enforcement and intelligence missions.\nFigure 3.4\n \nFBI Director Robert Mueller. (Source: FBI)\nHowever, to retain both missions, Director Mueller agreed to sweeping changes. The\nmost significant of these was an enhanced focus on intelligence. To facilitate these\nchanges, the Bureau reorganized itself and hired hundreds of analysts. Now, instead of\ninvestigations being handled almost exclusively \nby Special Agents assigned to field\n91\noffices, the process has become much more centralized, with agents and analysts sharing\nresponsibilities. New squads, called Field Intelligence Groups, were set up in all 56 FBI\nfield offices.\nTable 3.2\n FBI Priorities\nNational Security Priorities\n1. Terrorism\n2. Counterintelligence\n3.

Weapons of Mass Destruction\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation. What we investigate. \nwww.fbi.gov/about-\nus/investigate/what_we_investigate\n.\nThe FBI\u2019s priorities are listed in \nTable 3.2\n. The organization\u2019s top two priorities,\nterrorism and counterintelligence, are clearly part of its intelligence mission; however,\ntoday all investigations are carried out with an \u201cintelligence-led\u201d focus.\nThe FBI\u2019s operating budget for 2016 is approximately $8 billion; according to its\nfunding request to Congress, the FBI employs \u201c13,074 Special Agents (SAs), 3,083\nIntelligence Analysts (IAs), and 18,880 professional staff\u201d (Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, n.d.). It is organized into 56 different field offices and several hundred\nsmaller satellite offices called Resident Agencies. Despite the fact that the FBI\ninvestigates domestic crime and intelligence-related matters, many of its personnel are\nassigned overseas in order to address terrorism at its roots. In addition, the FBI operates\nmore than 100 \nJoint Terrorism Task Forces\n (JTTFs) in the United States; the JTTFs\nbring together personnel from federal, state, and local agencies to investigate terrorism\n92\nmatters. Since 9\u201311, the FBI and JTTFs have broken up numerous terrorism plots in the\nUnited States. Moreover, in 2010, Bureau agents arrested 10 individuals who were part of\na \u201csleeper cell\u201d planted by the Russian Intelligence Service, the SVR. The FBI also assigns\nLegal Attaches (LEGATs) to U.S. embassies overseas. LEGATs conduct liaison with\nforeign intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\nDepartment of Justice: DEA\nDrug cartels are large, complex organizations. As a result, investigations of these\norganizations gain considerably from intelligence collection and analysis. The early part\nof the twenty-first century has also introduced a new reality\u2014 the era of \u201cnarco-\nterrorism.\u201d Drug sales generate huge profits that, in turn, can fund terror operations (see\nBox 3.1\n for an example).\nThe DEA, then, is a member of the IC for two reasons: (1) illegal drugs threaten U.S.\nnational security, as set forth by the DNI in \nVision 2015\n; and (2) illicit drug sales fund\nterror organizations, such as the FARC in Colombia and the Taliban in Afghanistan.\nThe DEA was established in 1973 (\nFigure 3.5\n). It followed other federal agencies that\nhad engaged in narcotics and drug enforcement, to include the Federal Bureau of\nNarcotics (1930\u20131968) and the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (1968\u20131973).\nDEA personnel have historically worked with other elements of the IC, to include the\nCIA, in counter-narcotics efforts. They have a large overseas presence, including\nForeign-deployed Advisory and Support Teams that deploy as needed.\nBox 3.1\n \nDea and Terrorism\nDecember 15, 2011\u2014DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart and U.S. Attorney for\nthe Southern District of New York Preet Bharara announced today the filing of a\ncivil money-laundering and \nin rem\n forfeiture complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) alleging\na massive, international scheme in which Lebanese financial institutions, including\na bank and two exchange houses linked to Hizballah, used the U.S. financial system\nto launder narcotics trafficking and other criminal proceeds through West Africa\nand back into Lebanon. As part of the scheme, funds were wired from Lebanon to\nthe United States to buy used cars, which were then transported to West Africa.\nCash from the sale of the cars, along with proceeds of narcotics trafficking, were\nthen funneled to Lebanon through Hizballah-controlled money laundering\nchannels. Substantial portions of the cash were paid to Hizballah, which the U.S.\nDepartment of State designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 1997. As\nalleged in the Complaint, the Hizballah-linked financial institutions involved in the\nscheme include the Lebanese Canadian Bank (\u201cLCB\u201d) and two Lebanese exchange\nhouses\u2014the Hassan Ayash Exchange Company and Ellissa Holding\u2014and their\n93\nrelated subsidiaries and affiliates.\nSource:\n Drug Enforcement Administration.

In addition\nto providing tactical and strategic intelligence to assist in the investigation of drug\ncartels and organizations, it also produces the \nNational Drug Threat Assessment\nSummary\n, an unclassified publication that outlines \u201cthe threats posed to our\ncommunities by transnational criminal organizations and the illicit drugs they distribute\nthroughout the United States\u201d (Drug Enforcement Administration, 2015: iii).\nDepartment of State: Bureau of Intelligence and Research\nIn one form or another, the State Department has had a long history of intelligence. For\nexample, after World War I, the \u201cBlack Chamber\u201d cryptologic project was a joint effort\nbetween it and the military. The intelligence arm of the State Department, the Bureau of\nIntelligence and Research (INR), began as the Research and Analysis Branch of the OSS\nduring World War II. After the war and the dissolution of the OSS, it passed to the\nDepartment of State.\nThe mission of the INR is to develop intelligence to serve U.S. diplomacy. As one\nmight imagine, this can take many forms. It can help inform a \npolicymaker\u2019s decision\nregarding intervention in a foreign country, or it can help an ambassador in the field\nbetter understand his or her counterparts in a foreign land. The INR also closely\n94\nexamines law enforcement, geographic, and international boundary issues.\nGiven the sensitivities involved in foreign affairs, some of the most delicate issues in\ngovernment are discussed in classified diplomatic cables. Ambassadors in the field have\nto know that their often frank and candid assessments of foreign leaders and conditions\nin lands affecting the United States will be afforded the greatest level of secrecy.\nConsequently, when more than 250,000 classified State Department cables were released\non a website known as Wikileaks beginning in 2010, State Department personnel were\nunderstandably upset. The extent of the damage of the leaks has yet to be determined.\nThe alleged leaker, an Army Private First Class named Chelsea Manning, was convicted\nin 2013 of violations of the Espionage Act and other offenses. Manning was given a\nsentence of 35 years\u2019 imprisonment. On January 17, 2017, then-President Barack Obama\ncommuted Manning\u2019s sentence and released her from prison.\nIn March 2015, it was revealed that Hillary Clinton had used a private email server\nduring her tenure as Secretary of State rather than the official one maintained by the\nState Department. After an initial investigation, the State Department concluded that\n2,100 messages contained information deemed to be classified, including 22 at the Top\nSecret level, although none were marked classified at the time. This finding prompted\ninvestigations by the State Department\u2019s Inspector General and the FBI to determine\nwhether U.S. security had been compromised and/or whether Secretary Clinton had\nbroken the law.\nIn May 2016, the State Department\u2019s Inspector General released an 83-page report in\nwhich he concluded that Secretary Clinton had not obtained the required permissions to\nmaintain a private server for official business; in fact, had she sought such approval it\nwould not have been granted because of the potential for security risks. Likewise, she\nfailed to maintain her emails in proper fashion to permit preserving public records\n(Office of the Inspector General, 2016). In July 2016, the FBI concluded its investigation\nand recommended to the Attorney General that former Secretary of State Clinton not be\nprosecuted. This was an unusual move by the FBI, since its primary mission was to\ngather evidence and not recommend for or against prosecution.\nDepartment of the Treasury: Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence\nThe Treasury Department handles financial intelligence. Financing is important whether\none is an international terrorist, a member of an organized \ncrime faction, or the leader of\nan emerging state. Because everyone maintains some sort of financial records, they offer\npowerful insight into a group\u2019s membership and operations. Often, they provide valuable\nevidence that can be used in court.\nIn 2004, several entities merged to form the Treasury\u2019s Office of Terrorism and\nFinancial Intelligence (TFI). Its stated mission is:\nThe Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence (TFI) marshals the department\u2019s intelligence and enforcement\nfunctions with the twin aims of safeguarding the financial system against illicit use and combating rogue\n95\nnations, terrorist facilitators, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferators, money launderers, drug\nkingpins, and other national security threats. (United States Department of the Treasury, 2011)\nThe offices that fall under the TFI include the Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial\nCrimes, the OIA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, the Treasury Executive Office for\nAsset Forfeiture, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nMilitary Agencies: Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines\nThe military controls a huge portion of the IC\u2019s budget; some have estimated that it is as\nhigh as 80%. Of course, the first major use of intelligence by the United States was for\nmilitary purposes and occurred even as the Colonies fought for their independence. The\nfirst two permanent U.S. intelligence services were the Office of Naval Intelligence\n(established in 1882) and the Army\u2019s Military Intelligence Division (established in 1885\nand now referred to as the Army Intelligence and Security Command).\nEach of the services has its own intelligence component; because each performs a\nsimilar function for its branch, we will discuss them together. Generally, military\nintelligence supports the commander and allows him or her to make better decisions.\nThe admonition to \u201cknow one\u2019s enemy\u201d dates back to at least Sun Tzu and likely before.\nCommanders need all levels of intelligence\u2014frontline units engaged in meeting the\nenemy or operating in an unknown environment require tactical intelligence; this may\nbe as simple as knowing whether the enemy is over the next hill. Senior commanders use\nstrategic intelligence to make long-term decisions that will affect the entire theater. In\naddition to these two concepts, the military adds a third type\u2014operational intelligence.\nThis falls somewhere between strategic and tactical intelligence and concerns \nitself with\nmedium-range planning and decision-making. Military intelligence is further discussed\nin \nChapter 12\n (\u201cMilitary Intelligence\u201d). The intelligence components of the various\nbranches of the armed forces are listed in \nTable 3.3\n.\nTable 3.3\n Intelligence Components of the Armed Services\nService Branch\nCommand\nUnited States Air Force\nAir Force Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance\nAgency\nUnited States Army\nArmy Intelligence and Security Command\nUnited States Marine\nCorps\nMarine Corps Intelligence Activity\nUnited States Navy\nOffice of Naval Intelligence\nMilitary Agencies: Defense Intelligence Agency\nBy the end of World War II, service branches had developed a robust intelligence\n96\ncapability. However, their efforts were poorly coordinated, leading to waste, needless\nduplication, and confusing findings. As a result, beginning in the late 1950s, the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) took steps to improve coordination. In 1961, Secretary of\nDefense Robert S. McNamara created the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), whose\ndirector is appointed by, and reports to, the Secretary of Defense. The DIA was created\nto provide current all-source intelligence to the DoD, consolidate analysis on general\nmilitary topics performed by each of the military departments, coordinate DoD\u2019s\ncontribution to national intelligence estimates, confirm the needs of DoD components\nfor intelligence, and coordinate the performance of common functions.\nThe DIA manages certain department-wide intelligence activities. Its National\nMilitary Intelligence Collection Center confirms the need for intelligence requirements\nlevied by defense customers. The DIA also establishes overall priorities for intelligence\ngathering by national systems to satisfy military requirements. In a war or crisis,\nauthority to task these national systems passes to the Secretary of Defense, and DIA acts\nas the focal point for such taskings. The DIA also manages the Defense Attach\u00e9 System\nand coordinates intelligence analysis and production among the military departments\nand Unified Commands (Defense Intelligence Agency, n.d.).\nIn 2012, the DIA established the \nDefense Clandestine Service (DCS)\n, which oversees\nthe operation of approximately 500 clandestine operatives worldwide. DIA Case Officers\noperate much like their CIA counterparts, collecting information that is subsequently\nanalyzed and turned into \nintelligence. While the DIA\u2019s and CIA\u2019s missions often overlap,\nthe DIA tends to focus more on military threats and challenges.\nThe DCS was not an entirely \u201cnew\u201d entity when it was established; rather, it\nrepresented a consolidation of other DoD organizations that historically had performed\nespionage duties. In addition, by 2012 it was clear that threats and challenges to the\nmilitary were moving beyond traditional battle spaces. In order to remain relevant in an\nera of transnational terrorist groups and cyber \u201cwarriors\u201d who could operate anywhere\nin the world, the military needed to expand its base of operations\u2014the DCS is part of\nthat initiative.\nThe DCS appears to be paying dividends. A 2015 article in \nForeign Policy\n reported\nthat:\nThe Pentagon has also significantly expanded its human intelligence capabilities \u2026 especially so in the cases of\nthe Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s Defense Clandestine Service and special operations forces [SOF]. \u201cSOF is now\ncollecting a very hefty percentage of all defense intelligence,\u201d \u2026 a few years ago, \u201cit was barely on the scale.\u201d\n(Taylor, 2015)\nDIA personnel collect and analyze information across a broad spectrum of areas;\nvirtually anything related to a foreign military, from the capability of its weapons\nsystems to the personality of its leaders, are studied by the agency. Because the U.S.\nmilitary leadership is interested in foreign military technology, DIA engineers are adept\nat reverse engineering captured weapons and arms. Their personnel perform\nsophisticated MASINT operations to indirectly measure such things as suspected nuclear\ndetonations.\n97\nThe DIA maintains the following centers and directorates (Defense Intelligence\nAgency, n.d.):\nDirectorates\nDirectorate for Analysis\nDirectorate for Operations\nDirectorate for Science & Technology\nDirectorate for Mission Services\nIntelligence Centers\nAmericas Center\nAsia/Pacific Center\nDefense Combating Terrorism Center\nEurope/Eurasia Center\nMiddle East/Africa Center\nMilitary Agencies: National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\nCartography, otherwise known as mapmaking, has been a staple of navigation since its\nearliest days. Likewise, aerial intelligence has been used since the Civil War. As the two\ndisciplines grew, they found a common link\u2014maps could be drawn more accurately and\nintelligence obtained more holistically through aerial observation.\nHence, over the years the government has formed a series of agencies to enhance both\naerial intelligence and mapmaking. During World War II, the Army established its Map\nService, which used a variety of cartographic techniques. With the advent of satellites,\nthe ability to discern landforms and collect imagery intelligence (IMINT) grew\nexponentially, as did the efforts of the government to exploit these techniques. In 1968,\nthe Army established the Topographic Command, the forerunner of the Defense\nMapping Agency. The Topographic Command operated independently from the\nNational Photographic Interpretation Center, a joint CIA\u2013military intelligence program\nestablished in 1961.\nIn 1996, these and other agencies were brought together in the National Imagery and\nMapping Agency (NIMA), which had both a cartographic and an intelligence function.\nIn 2003, with the growing acceptance of the concept of GEONT, NIMA was renamed the\nNational Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).\nToday, NGA employs a host of individuals with expertise in fields as varied as\naeronautical and imagery analysis, marine analysis, computer science, and engineering.\nIn addition to providing intelligence on adversaries, NGA has assisted in humanitarian\n98\nmissions as well. For example, during the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts in 2005, NGA\nsatellite imagery helped emergency personnel crafttheir response plans.\nMilitary Agencies: National Security Agency\nHeadquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, the National Security Agency (NSA) (\nFigure\n3.6\n) is responsible for the collection and analysis of foreign communications and signals\nintelligence. Recently, it has also assumed responsibility for protecting U.S.\ncommunications and information systems. A super-secret organization, for years the\ngovernment refused to even acknowledge that the NSA existed, although many people\nknew otherwise; this prompted the frequently told Washington joke that NSA stood for\n\u201cno such agency.\u201d\nThe NSA was formed in 1952; it evolved out of the Armed Forces Security Agency,\nwhich was judged to be ineffective and lacking in sufficient power. \nAs electronic\ncommunications have grown more sophisticated, so has the NSA\u2019s ability to capture and\ndecode them. One of the NSA\u2019s major missions is \ncryptanalysis\n, or code breaking.\nBecause computers generate many of today\u2019s codes, the NSA employs many computer\nscientists, engineers, and mathematicians. It also employs analysts skilled in foreign\nlanguages who can both translate and analyze conversations.\nFigure 3.6\n NSA Headquarters, Fort Meade, Maryland. (Source: NSA)\nLike the CIA, the NSA is limited by law to monitoring only foreign communications.\n99\nThis has been problematic at times. For example, in 2005, \nThe New York Times\n revealed\nthat the Bush administration had ordered the NSA to secretly monitor the conversations\nof individuals in the United States who were calling suspected foreign terrorists overseas.\nCritics charged that this violated the law; the FBI was responsible for monitoring\ndomestic conversations and then only when a proper warrant had been obtained from\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Eventually, the ACLU sued the government\nover the matter; although the ACLU prevailed in the lower court, an appellate court\nreversed the decision, siding with the government (see Risen & Lichtblau, 2005).\nAlthough its budget and number of employees remain classified, the NSA is thought\nto be substantial. It has been said that the NSA is the largest employer of mathematicians\nin the United States and that it owns the world\u2019s largest concentration of\nsupercomputers, although the NSA will not confirm this. Edward Snowden was working\nas a contractor at the NSA when he released classified documents to journalists.\nMilitary Agencies: National Reconnaissance Office\nThe National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) designs, builds, launches, and operates\nsatellites to gather imagery for intelligence. It also conducts analysis of images captured\nfrom space. If the NGA\u2019s legacy is tied to the Army, the NRO traces its lineage to the Air\nForce. In 1960, President Eisenhower established the NRO to facilitate better\ncoordination between the Air Force and CIA\u2019s IMINT activities.\nIn its early days, the NRO operated America\u2019s first system of spy satellites, the Corona\nProgram. Since that time, its efforts have become ever more sophisticated. The NRO\u2019s\nmission and functions have historically been kept secret. In fact, the government did not\neven acknowledge that the agency existed until 1992.\nNRO satellites provide both GEOINT and SIGINT. At this point, readers might be\nconfused about the difference between the NGA and the NRO. In fact, the NGA is\nprimarily an analytical agency, using both the imagery produced by NRO and\ncommercial satellites to generate intelligence. Similarly, the NSA uses NRO satellites to\ngather SIGINT.\n100\nFederal, State, and Local Agencies\nFederal Agencies\nAlthough the organizations described above constitute the \u201cofficial\u201d IC, it would be\nwrong to conclude that they are the only ones that collect, analyze, and disseminate\nintelligence. Consider, for example, pandemics (infectious diseases that spread across\nhuman populations over a large region). Would such an event, especially one that\ninvolved a highly deadly pathogen, not threaten national security? Of course it would. In\naddition to killing large numbers of people, it would paralyze commerce, cripple military\nand law enforcement functions, and lead to general social disorder. In 1918, for example,\nthe \u201cSpanish Flu\u201d pandemic killed three percent of the world\u2019s population.\nTo that end, one has to expand the definition of \u201cintelligence\u201d beyond what is\nconventionally referred to as the IC. On the federal level, that would \ncertainly include\nlaw enforcement agencies. The Secret Service, Customs and Border Protection, Internal\nRevenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Bureau of Alcohol,\nTobacco, Firearms, and Explosives all employ analysts who produce intelligence. As the\npandemic example above makes clear, organizations that monitor health trends such as\nthe Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization should also be\ncounted. Indeed, the closer one looks, the more difficult it becomes to exclude almost any\nagency. The Census Bureau produces population projections and the Department of\nEducation tracks literacy rates. Although this may all seem far afield of what most\npeople consider intelligence, consider what really matters: is information analyzed in a\nway that reduces uncertainty and allows policymakers to make better decisions for the\ngood of the country? If the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d the organization is engaged in intelligence.\nState and Local Agencies\nThe same argument that was made above for federal agencies could be made for several\nthat operate at the state and local level\u2014they also produce intelligence that is beneficial\nfor the decision-maker. However, for the sake of brevity, the remainder of this chapter\nwill concentrate on those that are of importance to national security.\nState and Local Police Departments\nAt nearly 700,000 strong, state and local police officers are the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of national\nsecurity. No one knows a community better than the officer on the beat\u2014consequently,\n101\nno one is in a better position to recognize that something is amiss or out of place. Almost\nall state police agencies and many large local police and sheriffs\u2019 departments have some\nsort of intelligence capability. Perhaps none is more robust than that of the New York\nCity Police Department (NYPD), whose intelligence unit is run by former FBI official\nJohn Miller. According to its website, the NYPD Intelligence Division\u2019s analysts have\nqualifications similar to those employed by the CIA and DIA; many have graduate\ndegrees in math, physics, International Affairs, Strategic Studies, and Islam and the\nMiddle East. The division also has language expertise in Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto,\nGerman, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Chinese. To assist in terrorism and transnational\norganized crime matters, the NYPD stations detectives in 11 foreign countries, such as\nFrance and Israel, where they serve in a liaison capacity, much like FBI Legal Attach\u00e9s\n(New York City Police Department, n.d.).\nNew York has not suffered another large terrorist attack since 9/11, and many credit\nthe work of the NYPD and federal authorities for this excellent record. However, not\neveryone is enamored with the NYPD\u2019s efforts. Some civil liberties groups accuse it of\nspying on minority groups, especially Muslims, with little or no predication. Still, others\nnote that the Intelligence Division has not worked well with other agencies, particularly\nthe FBI (see, e.g., National Public Radio, 2011).\nAlthough no other American police agency has the resources of the NYPD, many\nothers, large and small, participate in intelligence operations. This has led in recent years\nto the creation of a new theory of law enforcement. Termed \nIntelligence Led Policing\n(ILP)\n, it emphasizes that intelligence should drive all facets of policing, from patrol to\ninvestigations. ILP was first started in the Kent Constabulary in England in the 1990s.\nInvestigators there had been plagued by a series of car thefts that they worked on as\nindividual cases. At some point, they decided to employ intelligence tactics to discern\nwhether a pattern would emerge. Sure enough, they soon discovered that the thefts were\nlinked and that a few individuals were behind the vast majority of them. Once the police\narrested the identified suspects, car thievery plunged dramatically.\nIn the early twenty-first century, the ILP movement took root in the United States.\nTwo important publications that describe how any agency can apply the principles of\nILP are the Justice Department\u2019s \nNational Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan\n (United\nStates Department of Justice, 2003) and Marilyn Peterson\u2019s \nIntelligence-Led Policing: The\nNew Intelligence Architecture\n (Peterson, 2005). Like the FBI and DEA, domestic law\nenforcement agencies are governed by strict laws and rules that regulate intelligence\nactivities directed at U.S. citizens. Agencies that gather foreign intelligence, such as the\nDIA, CIA, and NSA, operate under a far different set of rules.\nFusion Centers\nIn an ideal world, intelligence would flow across organizational boundaries and wind up\nwhere it is needed most. To that end, if a local police officer in the United States\n102\ndeveloped intelligence during a traffic stop that would assist soldiers on the ground in\nAfghanistan, the intelligence should somehow make its way to them (subject to\nappropriate laws and guidelines, of course). One of the lessons learned following the\nattacks of 9/11 was that too much good information from a host of sources was not\nmaking its way into the system; furthermore, the sharing of intelligence at all levels lefta\ngreat deal to be desired. As a result, in 2003 the DHS and Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ)\nOffice of Justice Programs began setting up \nfusion centers\n to be run \nby the various\nstates and, in some cases, large cities. According to the DHS, fusion centers:\n[S]erve as primary focal points within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and\nsharing of threat-related information among federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) partners. (United\nStates Department of Homeland Security, 2011b)\nAt fusion centers, police officers can work side by side with CIA and FBI personnel and\nindividuals from the private sector. Fusion center analysts produce intelligence reports\nfrom a wide variety of sources. In turn, these are released to consumers at many\ndifferent levels. To the greatest extent possible, information is declassified to ensure that\nit can be disseminated widely. Although fusion centers were first started to address the\nissue of terrorism, in many cases they have expanded their focus to an \u201call hazards\u201d\napproach that includes more traditional matters, such as drug trafficking and organized\ncrime. The proliferation of fusion centers has generated opposition from such groups as\nthe ACLU. For information regarding this debate, see \nChapter 10\n (\u201cConstitutional\nMandates\u2014Overview of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Roots\u201d).\n103\nPrivate Sector\nMany organizations in the private sector have intelligence departments that engage in\nbusiness or \u201ccompetitive\u201d intelligence. This gives them an edge over their competitors, as\nmuch as policymakers gain \u201cdecision advantage\u201d over adversaries. In this section,\nhowever, we concentrate on the private corporations that produce intelligence for\nnational security.\nA series of articles by the \nWashington Post\n in 2010 revealed some startling\ninformation: of the estimated 854,000 people then possessing government top-secret\nclearances, 265,000 were private contractors (Priest & Arkin, 2010). \nPost\n reporters Dana\nPriest and William Arkin further described some of the duties these individuals\nperformed:\nPrivate contractors \u2026 have recruited spies in Iraq, paid bribes for information in Afghanistan \u2026 helped snatch a\nsuspected extremist offthe streets \u2026 interrogated detainees once held at secret prisons abroad and watched over\ndefectors. (Priest & Arkin, 2010)\nIn short, it appears that private sector personnel perform most, if not all, of the same\nduties that government workers do. In fact, a \u201crevolving door\u201d currently exists between\nthe public and private intelligence sectors. It is not \nunusual for individuals to retire or\notherwise leave government service and begin work in a private capacity, either as an\nemployee for one of the big contracting firms or in one of the many small, niche\ncompanies that have sprung up in recent years. Although working in the private sector\nhas been a choice for retirees for a long time, a somewhat newer phenomenon has begun\nto emerge\u2014entry-level personnel often find it easier to join the intelligence world by first\ngaining employment in a private firm. There, they gain experience and the ever-\nimportant security clearance, which makes them considerably more competitive for the\ndifficult-to-get CIA, DEA, and other agency jobs.\nAre private contractors good for the IC? Many would argue they are necessary. It is\ndifficult and time consuming to hire a government employee. If a problem with a short\ndeadline appears, it is often much more efficacious to hire a private firm to address it.\nLikewise, hiring contractors gives the government a certain amount of flexibility\u2014when\nthe problem disappears or the contract expires, the private firm can be let go. This is\nmuch more difficult to do with a government employee who is afforded civil service\nprotections.\nThat said, not everyone is happy with the current relationship. In testimony before the\nSenate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, correspondent and\nformer private sector intelligence analyst Joshua Foust had this to say:\nThe current state of IC contracting is incoherent. There is broad confusion about the nature of what are\nappropriate government roles and contractor roles, along with inconsistent accountability and poor resourcing\nfor accountability mechanisms. Contracts are often worded vaguely or incompletely, and ever-changing\n104\nrequirements, deliverables, and performance metrics (all of which are supposed to catalogue and record how a\ncompany fulfills a contract) create an environment rife for exploitation by companies seeking to extract revenue\nfrom the process. (Foust, 2011: 2)\nDespite the discomfort of some, private companies are firmly entrenched in the IC.\nGiven the huge role they currently play, it is doubtful they will disappear soon.\n105\nConclusion\nOne of the most striking facets of the post 9/11 IC is its commitment to become a\n\u201ccommunity.\u201d Historically, agencies worked, often in isolation, to provide intelligence to\ntheir constituencies. The results were often fragmentary, contradictory, duplicative, and,\nas the 9/11 Commission pointed out,\nBox 3.2\n \nGetting Osama Bin Laden: A Lesson in\nCollaboration\nThe raid that killed Osama bin Laden represents a true collaboration among IC\nagencies, exactly the sort of thing that was envisioned when the ODNI was\nestablished. According to Losey (2011), one former senior intelligence official\nremarked:\n\u201c[A]t the end of the day, it\u2019s a lot of small things, like the emphasis on collaboration\u2014 squishy as that\nmay be\u2014that ultimately changes the way people behave and the way organizations perform.\u201d\nThe CIA led the overall intelligence effort. In addition:\nNRO provided satellite imagery of the compound.\nNGA made a series of maps and detailed images.\nODNI aided in collaboration.\nOther military intelligence agencies provided input and assistance.\nFinally, SEAL Team Six, an elite Navy Special Forces unit, carried out the raid.\nThey were supported by the Joint Special Operations Command, itself a\ncollaboration of highly specialized military units from all the services.\nAs should be clear, the name of the game today is \u201cjointness,\u201d which is another\nway of saying that everybody must work together.\nSource:\n Losey, S.

Some members of the\nintelligence community (IC), such as Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Case Officers,\nspend the bulk of their careers engaged almost solely in information collection, usually\nfrom human sources. Analysts also collect information, often from open sources.\nIn today\u2019s world, we are awash in a sea of information. Thanks to the internet and\nother communications technologies, the amount of data surrounding us is increasing at a\nrate that is almost unfathomable. This is both a blessing and a curse for the IC. On the\none hand, it is easier than ever to discover information almost instantaneously on just\nabout any subject. However, the sheer volume of information in the world makes data\ndifficult to manage. Finding the \u201cright\u201d material has often been compared to finding a\nneedle in a haystack. Consider that the haystacks of today are exponentially larger than\nat any time in human history. Although people willingly divulge all sorts of information\nabout themselves via Facebook, Twitter, and other networking sites, the information in\nthe greatest demand by analysts and policymakers is often protected and hidden away.\nFinally, it is getting ever more difficult to gauge the credibility of much of the data that\nexists. Someone may construct a website that appears professional and legitimate, and\nyet its information may be totally incorrect.\nOver the years, the IC has devised many ways to gather information. In ancient times,\nspying was almost exclusively a human endeavor\u2014people watched events surreptitiously\nor persuaded others to provide them with material. Today, there are myriad methods\nused to obtain data, ranging from intercepting communications to watching activities\nfrom overhead via satellites. In this chapter, we will discuss various means of\ninformation collection and the challenges that come along with those efforts.\n113\nConsiderations for Collection\nCredibility Issues: Vetting the Source\nMany readers are familiar with the acronym GIGO, which stands for \u201cgarbage in,\ngarbage out.\u201d Nowhere is this more true than in the intelligence world. Information that\ngets collected should be correct, or at least as correct as possible. This can be very\ndifficult to accomplish in a process that is fraught with opportunities for \u201cbad\u201d\ninformation at almost every step. The results of incorrect data can be devastating. In\n2002, the IC was asked whether Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of\nmass destruction. In the course of their analysis, IC personnel relied on a human source\ncodenamed \n\u201cCurveball,\u201d who claimed to have worked at an Iraqi biological weapons\nlaboratory. Curveball described many frightening facets of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass\ndestruction (WMD) program, to include the existence of mobile biological laboratories.\nThe United States used Curveball\u2019s information, which was later determined to be false,\nto help build a case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Despite warnings from the German\nFederal Intelligence Service that Curveball was not a credible source, his \u201cgarbage\u201d\ninformation was never properly scrutinized. No significant caches of WMDs were ever\ndiscovered, to the great embarrassment of the IC. As a result, the Director of National\nIntelligence (DNI) established a policy where the CIA\u2019s National Clandestine Service\nnow vets all the sources used in the preparation of important intelligence products to\nensure that they have not been recalled or otherwise seriously questioned (Ricks, 2006).\nAnalysts generally do not interact with human sources\u2014this is usually the job of Case\nOfficers or Special Agents. It is therefore their responsibility to establish a source\u2019s\ncredibility. This can be accomplished in a number of different ways. Some sources\nprovide information over a long period, whereas for others it may be a \u201cone shot deal.\u201d\nIn the former case, the officer will develop a relationship with sources and can gauge\ntheir track records for providing information. Some sources are almost always right,\nwhereas others may be hit-or-miss. If someone is consistently wrong, it is doubtful they\nwill remain a source for long. Although it is inevitable that a relationship will develop\nbetween officer and source, relationships that become too close can be dangerous.\nOfficers need to remember that they are the source\u2019s handler, not their friend. Too close\na relationship can blind a handler to their source\u2019s flaws and can lead to big trouble (see\nBox 4.1\n).\nCollectors can corroborate source information in many ways. Independent verification\ncan be accomplished through investigative techniques, such as surveillances or by\nobtaining the same information from a different source. However, care must be taken\u2014\nsee the example in \nBox 4.2\n, where independent corroboration appears to exist but, in\n114\nfact, does not.\nOn occasion, human sources are also given a polygraph examination to check the\nveracity of their claims. Polygraphs are often incorrectly referred to as \u201clie detectors.\u201d In\nfact, they do not detect lies\u2014they detect changes in body functioning (e.g., blood\npressure, heartbeat, galvanic skin response) that are believed to occur in most people\nwhen they lie. Polygraphers are highly trained individuals who are skilled in conducting\ninterviews. They ultimately judge whether a person is being truthful or displaying signs\nof deception during the examination.\nAlthough human sources are often the cause of false information, no collection\ntechnique is perfect. One reason for this is that every intelligence \nservice engages in\ndenial and deception\n. The previously described \u201cdecision advantage\u201d is achieved by\nknowing an adversary\u2019s secrets while protecting your own. One way to achieve this is by\nproviding an adversary with false information. A classic case of denial and deception\noccurred during the Cold War when the Soviet Union allegedly flew the same nuclear\ncapable bombers past observers multiple times to give the illusion that they possessed far\nmore of the planes than they actually did. This helped convince some that a \u201cbomber\ngap\u201d existed, and that the United States should immediately embark on an aggressive\ncampaign to catch up to the Soviets. However, President Eisenhower was skeptical and\ninsisted on more proof; this was one factor that led to the development of the U-2 spy\nplane.\nBox 4.1\n \nThe Whitey Bulger Affair\nJames \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger (\nFigure 4.1\n) was a Boston gangster. In 1979, he and his\npartner Stephen \u201cThe Rifleman\u201d Flemmi, became the leaders of the notorious\nWinter Hill Gang. For many years, Bulger and his associates allegedly engaged in a\nseries of brutal criminal acts, including murder, extortion, and racketeering.\nDespite his record of criminality, Bulger somehow managed to escape serious\nprosecution. A major reason for this was his secret relationship with the FBI\u2014\nbeginning in 1975, he served as a \u201cTop Echelon\u201d informant for the organization,\nproviding information primarily about the New England Mafia. Having such a\nhigh-ranking organized crime informant as Bulger was considered a coup by the\nBureau.\nHis handler, Special Agent John Connolly, received many accolades for his\n\u201cdevelopment\u201d of Whitey. However, while serving as an informant, Bulger\ncontinued to engage in criminality. To protect his valuable source, Connolly\nignored Bulger\u2019s crimes. Eventually, he actually supplied Whitey with information\nabout law enforcement investigations that involved the Winter Hill Gang.\nIn 1994, Bulger was about to be indicted on federal charges; however, before he\ncould be arrested, Connolly told Bulger about the indictment. Whitey fled and\nremained a fugitive until his arrest in 2011. For his activities, Connolly was\n115\nconvicted of obstruction of justice and racketeering and served a lengthy sentence\nin federal prison.\nThe Whitey Bulger case was a major embarrassment to the FBI. Former Special\nAgent Connolly likely had many reasons for his behavior in the matter\u2014some\nspeculate that he had become \u201ctoo close\u201d to Bulger, and felt a sense of loyalty\ntoward him, even to the point of breaking the law he had sworn to uphold.\nSource:\n Fitzpatrick, R., & Land, J.

You subsequently meet up with Doris\nwho works with Bill and she confirms that, indeed, Frank is cheating on his wife.\nYou have now heard the story from three independent sources and decide it must\nbe true.\nIn fact, what if Fred and Doris had also heard the story from Bill and were\nmerely passing it along? In this case, you really have only one true source of\ninformation, not three. Unfortunately, this can happen in the IC as well.\nFigure 4.1\n Wanted poster of James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger. (Source: FBI)\nThere are many methods that agencies use to assess source credibility and\ncommunicate that information to policymakers. The Army judges human source\ncredibility across two variables\u2014 \nSource Reliability\n and \nInformation Content\n. Simply\n116\nexpressed, these two variables mean the following:\nSource Reliability\u2014To what degree has the source provided reliable information\nin the past?\nInformation Content\u2014Has the information been corroborated by an outside\nsource and does it make sense?\nBoxes 4.3\n and \n4.4\n provide the Army\u2019s Source and Information Reliability Matrix (United\nStates Army, 2006).\nBox 4.3\n \nSource Reliability (U.S. Army)\nA Reliable\nNo doubt\n of authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency; has a\nhistory of complete reliability\nB Usually\nReliable\nMinor doubt\n about authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency;\nhas a history of valid information most of the time\nC Fairly\nReliable\nDoubt\n of authenticity, trustworthiness, or competency but has\nprovided valid information in the past\nD Not\nUsually\nReliable\nSignificant doubt\n about authenticity, trustworthiness, or\ncompetency but has provided valid information in the past\nE Unreliable\nLacking\n in authenticity, trustworthiness, and competency; history\nof invalid information\nF Cannot Be\nJudged\nNo basis\n exists for evaluating the reliability of the source\nSource:\n United States Army (2006: B-1)\nBox 4.4\n \nInformation Content (U.S. Army)\n1 Confirmed\nConfirmed\n by other independent sources; \nlogical\n in itself;\nConsistent\n with other information on the subject\n2 Probably\nTrue\nNot confirmed; \nlogical\n in itself; \nconsistent\n with other information\non the subject\n3 Possibly\nTrue\nNot confirmed; \nreasonably logical\n in \nitself; \nagrees with some\nother information on the subject\n4 Doubtfully\nTrue\nNot confirmed; possible but \nnot \nlogical; no other information\n on\nthe subject\n5\nImprobable\nNot confirmed; \nnot logical\n in itself; \ncontradicted\n by other\ninformation on the subject\n6 Cannot Be\nJudged\nNo \nbasis\n exists for evaluating the validity of the information\n117\nSource:\n United States Army (2006: B-2)\nInformation: How Much Is Enough?\nThe short answer to the above question is that there is never enough good, reliable\ninformation. The intelligence world is replete with uncertainty and ambiguity. It is rare\nthat a difficult, complex question can be answered easily and with no chance of being\nwrong. If that were the case, there would be little need for intelligence agencies. Instead,\nanalysts often weave together bits and pieces of information and use their best judgment\nto formulate an answer. For this reason, analysts need to communicate to policymakers\nhow confident they are in their judgments based on the information that has been\nprovided. One way they do this is by using estimative language (further described in\nChapter 11\n, \u201cWriting and Briefing for the Intelligence Community\u201d). Analysts and\nbriefers use estimative language to alert policymakers to the level of confidence they\nhave in their judgments based on the information available. Generally, three levels are\nused (Director of National Intelligence, 2007):\nHigh confidence\n generally indicates that judgments are based on high-quality\ninformation, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to render a\nsolid judgment. A \u201chigh confidence\u201d judgment is neither a fact nor a certainty,\nhowever, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.\nModerate confidence\n generally means that the information is credibly sourced\nand plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated sufficiently to warrant\na higher level of confidence.\nLow confidence\n generally means that the information\u2019s credibility and/or\nplausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or poorly\ncorroborated to make solid analytic inferences, or that we have significant\nconcerns or problems with the sources.\nA recurring phrase heard in today\u2019s IC is \u201call-source is best.\u201d In other words, information\nshould come from a variety of sources rather than just one. When one combines data\nobtained from human sources with such things as electronic overhears, surveillances,\nimagery from above and the like, a fuller, more accurate picture emerges. This is termed\nall-source intelligence\n and is the standard that has been articulated by the DNI. An\nexample of successful all-source intelligence can be found in tracking down and killing\nOsama bin Laden (see \nBox 3.2\n). Many different techniques were utilized to find him. The\ntrail started to heat up in 2007 when detainees at Guantanamo Bay provided the name of\na courier bin Laden utilized [human intelligence (HUMINT)]. The IC located the courier\nand tracked his movements through physical surveillance (FISUR) and by monitoring his\ncommunications [signals intelligence (SIGINT)]. When the courier arrived at bin Laden\u2019s\nsuspected hideout in Pakistan, satellites provided imagery that was used to determine its\n118\nlikely structure [geospatial intelligence (GEOINT)].\nProtecting Sources and Methods\nOnce a successful source of information has been established, the IC does all it can to\nprotect its secrecy. This makes sense\u2014once a collection \nsource or method\n becomes\nknown, it ceases to be of use. For example, Osama bin Laden used a satellite phone as\nlate as 1997; this allowed U.S. intelligence to monitor his movements. However, by 1998,\nhe had stopped using it. Some claimed this occurred because of a leak in a major media\noutlet (although this has been disputed). Regardless, bin Laden realized that his phone\nwas a potential source that Western intelligence could exploit\u2014he was correct and was\nwise to switch it off.\nProtecting sources and methods is a prime reason that classification systems were\nestablished (see \nChapter 8\n, \u201cCounterintelligence\u201d). Some types of intelligence (e.g.,\nhuman sources) often take years to develop. Good sources, such as disgraced FBI Special\nAgent Robert Hanssen and CIA Case Officer Aldrich Ames, can prove devastating.\nHanssen\u2019s espionage career lasted for over 20 years and provided the Soviets and\nRussians with extraordinary access to America\u2019s secrets; his value to the GRU (military\nintelligence), KGB, and SVR (successor to the KGB) was invaluable. Of course, the\nUnited States has developed its own share of human sources as well.\nIn addition to human sources, technical sources, such as advanced satellites, can take a\nlong time to develop. In addition, some can be quite costly. It is no wonder that\nprotecting sources and methods is of prime importance.\nAlthough pure intelligence agencies such as the CIA protect sources and methods at\nall costs, those that share a law enforcement mission, such as the FBI and the Drug\nEnforcement Administration, are in a somewhat different position. The FBI\u2019s current top\npriority is the prevention of terrorism. The Bureau does this in many ways, including\ndeveloping cases for prosecution in a court of law. Additionally, the FBI also has\njurisdiction over traditional crimes (e.g., wire fraud, bank robbery, kidnapping). Once a\ncase proceeds to court, the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees that\ndefendants can confront witnesses against them in court:\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of\nthe State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously\nascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the\nwitnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the\nAssistance of Counsel for his defence [sic].\nNot everyone who provides information in a criminal case will be required to testify; for\na variety of reasons, many people who provide information do not wish their identities\nto be known. To accomplish these competing goals, \nthe FBI established three categories\nof individuals whose identities it agreed to protect:\n119\nConfidential Informant (CI):\n An individual who provides information in\ncriminal matters. The Bureau keeps this individual\u2019s identity secret, even if it\nmeans losing a case in court. In some cases, individuals start out as informants\nbut eventually agree to testify, although this is not a requirement. Some\ninformants provide information for years on a host of matters.\nAsset:\n An Asset is like a CI except that they provide information on national\nsecurity matters (terrorism and counterintelligence). Like the CI, the Bureau\nnever makes this person\u2019s identity known.\nCooperating Witness:\n An individual who is recruited with the specific\nknowledge that they will have to provide testimony at some point, although\ntheir identity is kept secret during the duration of the investigative portion of\nthe case. A cooperating witness may be authorized to engage in some acts of\ncriminality (e.g., undercover drug buy) to help prove the elements of the case.\nWhile the FBI is in the process of re-naming these categories, we anticipate that the\nfunctions they perform will not differ markedly.\n120\nFirst Step in Collection\u2014You Need to Have a Plan\nThe intelligence cycle (\nChapter 7\n, \u201cPutting It All Together: The Intelligence Cycle\u201d)\npresents an orderly, step-by-step process where collection precedes organization and\nanalysis. Of course, the reality is much different. Collection is ongoing\u2014it never stops.\nOften, the result of the process is only that more information is needed. However, before\ncollection begins, it is necessary to have a plan; in the intelligence world, these are\nreferred to as \ncollection plans (CP)\n. This is a crucial step. Ideally, a policymaker will\nhave made a request for certain intelligence. Although this does happen, analysts and\ncollectors may have to anticipate the needs of their bosses. As experts in the field, they\noften have greater insight into their particular areas and alert policymakers to\nunexpected and potentially impactful events as they occur.\nEven when policymakers formulate questions, analysts need to refine them or seek\nclarification. For example, the President might ask the IC, \u201cWill Mexico represent a\nthreat to the United States in the next five years?\u201d That is a very broad and ambiguous\nquery. What kind of threat is meant\u2014an explosion of illegal immigrants, some sort of\neconomic collapse, exportation of narco-violence across the border, or something else\nentirely? Analysts can \nand should seek clarification, but occasionally they may find\nthemselves in the uncomfortable position of telling policymakers what they \u201cneed to\nknow.\u201d\nOnce these questions have been resolved, they can be crafted into \nrequirements\n, or\nthe goals of the particular intelligence endeavor. Some requirements are obvious, such as\nlearning as much about al Qa\u2019ida as possible. Others may not be so clear and may\nrequire further exploration. However, one thing is certain\u2014requirements should guide\nand inform the entire process. If the wrong questions are asked or the wrong goals set,\neverything that follows will be for naught. Resources and time will be wasted, and\npeoples\u2019 lives may needlessly be put at risk. Often, more than one requirement emerges.\nSome requirements may be more important to the policymaker than others, necessitating\nthe need for \npriorities\n. Once priorities have been established, the agency must then\ndecide how best to collect the needed information. This is a crucial step, and several\nvariables are considered.\nPerhaps most importantly, the collection technique must be appropriate for the needed\ninformation. In the days of the Soviet Union, the IC was very concerned with its military\ncapabilities: how many ships and airplanes did the Soviets have? Where were its nuclear\nmissiles located? Satellites and intercepted communications were a particularly effective\nway to determine this information; hence, imagery intelligence (IMINT) and SIGINT\nwere routinely used. However, these techniques are less capable of tracking terrorists,\nespecially those that avoid telephones and the internet and who travel singly or in small\ngroups. Most experts would agree that HUMINT provides better information about these\n121\nindividuals.\nAlthough aligning requirements with techniques is essential, it is not the only\nconsideration in putting together a collection plan. Budgets are a huge issue\u2014 some\ntechniques are clearly more expensive than others. For example, changing the orbit of a\nsatellite costs many times what paying a single human source would. Is the payoffworth\nthe costs? Depending on the issue, the answer might be \u201cyes,\u201d but this is a decision that\noften must be made at the highest levels of an agency.\nAnother consideration when choosing a collection source concerns the length of time\nnecessary from inception until a likely payoff is realized. This is termed \nlead time\n and is\noften a crucial factor in deciding which technique to use. For example, developing\nreliable human assets often takes years, whereas conducting a surveillance overflight can\nbe accomplished in hours.\nAgencies also must weigh the risks involved in collection activities. Sometimes these\ninvolve risks to life; more than 100 CIA personnel have been killed in the line of duty\nsince the agency was founded in 1947. More often these involve political risks, where the\nstanding or reputation of a country can suffer (see the case of Francis Gary Powers in\nBox 4.5\n).\nBox 4.5\n \nThe Frances Gary Powers Incident\nThe CIA began using the U-2 spy plane in 1956. A remarkable design for its time,\nthe U-2 could achieve elevations (70,000 ft) that were thought to be beyond the\nrange of Soviet antiaircraft missiles. In the mid-1950s, the United States began a\nseries of secret overflights of the Soviet Union using the U-2. Because of the\nsensitivity of the operations and the desire not to have military personnel flying\nover a potentially hostile country, the CIA was given the task of operating the U-2.\nUnfortunately, it proved to be a difficult aircraft to fly, and the pool of qualified\npilots was primarily limited to the military. To solve the problem, military pilots\nwould resign their commissions and go to work for the CIA, a process that came to\nbe known as \u201csheep dipping.\u201d\nOne such pilot was Air Force veteran Francis Gary Powers. The Soviets knew\nthat the United States was conducting covert surveillance operations and\ndesperately wanted to bring down a U-2 in the act of flying over their sovereign\nterritory. On May 1, 1960, they succeeded. Powers\u2019 plane was shot down by a\nsurface-to-air missile over Sverdlovsk. Powers was unable to deploy the aircraft\ndestruct system, and it crashed largely intact; Powers was captured alive.\nAt first, the United States claimed that the U-2 was a \u201cweather aircraft\u201d that had\nveered off-course. That story suffered almost immediately from credibility\nproblems. A short time later, Soviet Premier Khrushchev revealed that the \u201cspy\u201d\npilot had survived\u2014an embarrassed Eisenhower administration was caught in an\nobvious lie. The incident caused American\u2013Soviet relations to deteriorate (they\n122\nwere not good to begin with). In addition, the events unfolded at a particularly\nunfortunate time: two weeks before a planned summit between the two\nsuperpowers. The U-2 incident underscores the political risk that can accompany\ncollection efforts. Policymakers and agency heads need to remain sensitive to\npossible ramifications if something goes wrong.\nSource:\n Central Intelligence Agency. (2009). A look back \u2026 The Cold War:\nStrangers on a bridge. \nwww.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-\narchive/strangers-on-a-bridge.html\n.\nOnce a CP has been established, \ntaskings\n, or specific duties and collection goals, are\nestablished. For a large project, this may include assigning taskings to multiple agencies.\nThe CIA may be asked to develop or query human sources, the National Security\nAgency (NSA) may be tasked with listening in on an individual\u2019s international telephone\ntraffic, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) may be required to\nprovide aerial photographs. Again, all-source intelligence is the rule of the day.\n123\nCollection Methods: The \u201cINTs\u201d\nLike many other professions, the IC has its own language; much of this language\ninvolves the use of acronyms. In the case of collections, the suffix \u201cINT\u201d (for\n\u201cintelligence\u201d) is often used in conjunction with another term to describe the type of\ncollection that is being performed. Savvy readers will realize at this point that the\nmaterial that is collected is usually not intelligence until it has undergone processing and\nanalysis. Nevertheless, the use of the term is so ingrained that the \u201cINTs\u201d will be with us\nfor quite some time. What follows is a description of each.\nHuman Intelligence\nThe oldest form of collection, HUMINT, can provide a great deal of information that is\ndifficult to obtain otherwise. For example, a good source can not only recite facts, they\ncan provide a great deal of information about the personalities and intentions of the\nadversary. In addition, they can be given specific tasks to accomplish and can steer group\nactivities. In this way, human sources can take an active role in cases; this is not the case\nwith many of the other INTs that passively record or track information.\nThe lead time for HUMINT can be either short or long. If the stars align perfectly,\nhuman sources can begin to provide valuable information almost immediately.\nUnfortunately, this is often not the case. Case Officers and Special Agents will often\nspend years developing one or two quality sources. This usually means approaching and\n\u201ctrying out\u201d many individuals who may ultimately prove unproductive. Field personnel\nusually meet up with human sources in one of two ways: they either approach\nindividuals who they believe have good access to important information that they may\nbe willing to share, or they are approached by individuals who, for a variety of reasons,\nwant to provide information. Perhaps surprisingly, people often walk in to overseas\nembassies or stateside offices with the hope of selling or otherwise providing\ninformation. These \nwalk-ins\n must be carefully assessed to ensure they really have the\naccess they claim, that their information is accurate, and that they are not a \u201cdangle\u201d by\na foreign intelligence service hoping to penetrate the IC. Agencies can gain assets in a\nthird way: they can be provided by an allied foreign intelligence service or another\nagency. This often happens when the source is no longer in a position to furnish\ninformation to a host agency but may be in a position to help another (e.g., the FBI turns\nover a productive source to the CIA when he or she decides to relocate overseas).\nDeveloping the skills of a good HUMINT collector can take years. It is not necessary\nthat Case Officers or Special Agents be loud, outgoing, and gregarious, but they must be\ncomfortable dealing with people. They must also be \npersuasive\u2014after all, convincing\n124\nsomeone to commit espionage against their own country or turn against confidants is\ngenerally not an easy task. People become sources for a variety of reasons: money,\nrevenge, and ideology are but a few. It is important for collectors to understand their\nsource\u2019s motivation\u2014in that way, they can better provide the incentives that lubricate\nthe collection process.\nThere are also downsides to HUMINT. In the first place, it is potentially the riskiest\nform of collection. People caught betraying their countries generally suffer grave\nconsequences, up to and including death. In addition, operating in a hostile environment\ncan be dangerous. Few in the IC will ever forget the seven CIA employees who were\nkilled in Afghanistan in 2009 by a source-turned-suicide bomber as they attempted to\ngather information.\nAs well, foreign intelligence services often send in individuals who claim to want to\nwork for the United States but who are, in fact, \ndouble agents\n. These individuals remain\nloyal to their host government and provide false information. They also attempt to learn\nas much as possible about the workings and details of America\u2019s IC.\nOne of the shortcomings that the United States has faced over the years, \nespecially\n in\nthe area of foreign collection, has been its lack of capable language speakers, particularly\nin difficult-to-speak languages such as Chinese, Arabic, Pashto, and Urdu. This limits an\nindividual\u2019s ability to engage in the type of interaction necessary to develop\nrelationships. Although speaking a foreign language is not a prerequisite for entry into\nthe IC, it is a highly desired skill; those who can speak critical languages with a good\ndegree of fluency will be in high demand in the IC for years to come.\nAlthough most films portray the lives of CIA Case Officers as dangerous and\nglamorous, this is often not the case. Instead, many spend their careers looking for the\nnext great HUMINT source, which can mean inordinate hours at boring parties or in\ndreary cafes talking to countless individuals. However, some days are filled with\nincredible excitement and danger. Over the years, the IC has employed a distinguished\ngroup of dedicated professionals, most of whom will never be publicly known or\nacknowledged. Occasionally, interesting stories do emerge; one, involving a true\nrenaissance man named Morris \u201cMoe\u201d Berg, can be found in \nBox 4.6\n.\nSignals Intelligence\nSIGINT involves collecting information from electronic targets, to include telephones,\nradars, e-mail, computers, and the like. These targets generally fall into one of two\ncategories: communications between people [communications intelligence (\nCOMINT\n)]\nand electronic emissions [electronic \nintelligence (\nELINT\n)]. Computer, e-mail, and\ntelephone intercepts would be considered COMINT, whereas radar transmissions are\nELINT. Each can tell a great deal about an adversary, and both have been used for as\nlong as electronic communications have been around.\n125\nBox 4.6\n \nMoe Berg: Scholar, Professional Baseball\nPlayer, Linguist, Lawyer, Spy\nMoe Berg, once termed the \u201cbrainiest guy in baseball,\u201d was an amazing individual.\nBorn in 1902, he graduated from Princeton University and Columbia Law School. In\nall, Berg spoke seven languages and read 10 newspapers a day.\nBerg played professional baseball for 15 years, mostly as a catcher; following his\nplaying days, he coached for the Boston Red Sox.\nDuring World War II, Berg served as an intelligence agent with the Office of\nStrategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA. As an OSS officer, he\nparachuted into Yugoslavia to evaluate and assist resistance groups. In late 1943, he\nwas assigned to Project Larson, whose mission was to kidnap Italian missile\nscientists and interview European physicists to determine how close the Axis\npowers were to developing an atomic bomb. In one of his missions, Berg was\nordered to kill noted physicist Werner Heisenberg if it appeared the Nazis were\nclose to producing atomic weapons. Berg determined that they were not, which\nprobably saved Heisenberg\u2019s life.\nFollowing the war, Berg returned to the United States at which point he left the\nintelligence world. For his efforts, he was awarded the Medal of Freedom.\nSource:\n Dawidoff, N. (1994). The catcher was a spy: The mysterious life of Moe\nBerg. New York: Vintage Books.\nThe telegraph was invented in 1844. Before long, lines had been strung throughout the\nUnited States. During the Civil War, telegraphic communications were an essential part\nof the war effort\u2014both sides relied on the telegraph to send and receive important\nupdates. It was also during this period that the first interception of signals occurred\u2014\nclearly, an early attempt to establish \u201cdecision advantage.\u201d It was also during this period\nthat attempts were made to disguise transmissions through \nencryption\n or \ncoding\n.\nAlthough most people use the terms \u201ccode\u201d and \u201ccipher\u201d interchangeably, they are in\nfact different. A code is the substitution of text for particular words or phrases. So, for\nexample, \u201ccar\u201d could be coded as \u201cfish.\u201d For the code to be understood, each party must\nhave access to a code book. Ciphers, on the other hand, use a series of steps or an\nalgorithm for encryption. As a result, the key tends to be much smaller than a codebook.\nThe ultracomplex, computerized encryption devices of today utilize ciphers.\nSIGINT was used in the Spanish\u2013American War, but it was not until the dawn of the\ntwentieth century that it became firmly established. In 1901, the first trans-Atlantic radio\nsignal was broadcast. Because radio waves travel freely through the atmosphere, they\ncan be intercepted by anyone with the proper equipment. By World War I, militaries had\ndeveloped the ability to eavesdrop on their enemies. During this period, encryption\n126\nbecame more common and sophisticated\u2014every large government agency and military\nforce had its own method of enciphering. The information contained in such messages\nwas so important, however, that \u201cbreaking the code\u201d became a prime duty of IC\nagencies. \nCryptanalysts\n, informally referred to as \u201ccode-breakers,\u201d became an integral\npart the intelligence world.\nAlthough the United States generally lagged behind the rest of the developed world in\nits intelligence activities, by the conclusion of World War I it had become clear that\nAmerica needed its own SIGINT agency. In 1919, Herbert Yardley established the Black\nChamber, previously described in \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United\nStates\u201d). The forerunner of the NSA, the Black Chamber intercepted and decoded the\nmessage traffic of foreign governments. It was shut down in 1929 after Secretary of State\nHenry Stimson famously declared \u201cGentlemen do not read each other\u2019s mail.\u201d\nArguably, the most successful intelligence coup of World War II was the breaking of\nthe German Enigma cipher followed by the Japanese Purple code (see \nChapter 2\n,\n\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d). These SIGINT operations significantly\nshortened the war. Also, it was discovered that Axis radio traffic occupied certain\nfrequencies on the radio spectrum. Through triangulation, it became possible to locate\nthe position of ships and troops. This was one of the first examples of a special form of\nELINT called \nElectronic Support Measures (ESM)\n. Today, ESM is used by the military\nto identify electronic transmissions through their \u201csignatures.\u201d Specific types of aircraft,\nships, or missiles can be positively identified through ESM.\nAs technologies improved and electronic communications became ubiquitous, SIGINT\ncame to occupy a particularly important position in the IC. Although many agencies\nutilize SIGINT, the primary IC agency for monitoring foreign transmissions is the super-\nsecret NSA (see \nChapter 3\n, \u201cThe IC Today\u201d).\nIt is not coincidental that the NSA came into existence just as the Cold War kicked\ninto high gear. Communist Bloc countries were military giants. As such, they utilized\nelectronic transmissions in all phases of their operations. Whether discussing strategy,\ndirecting troops, chatting with far-flung emissaries, or sending facsimiles, COMINT was\nat an all-time high. ELINT also produced much valuable information. As a result,\nSIGINT came to play an especially important role in Cold War operations. In 1977,\nAdmiral Stansfield \nTurner was appointed Director of the CIA. Turner had a strong\ntechnological background and believed heavily in SIGINT and other technical collection\nplatforms. This came at the expense of HUMINT; during Turner\u2019s tenure, he eliminated\n800 operational positions. This would prove disastrous in the days following the Cold\nWar when al Qa\u2019ida and other asymmetrical threats became America\u2019s greatest\nchallenge.\nHowever, Turner cannot be unduly faulted for his decision. In the first place, SIGINT\nprovided good coverage of a large, technologically dependent adversary. \nBox 4.7\n relates a\nparticularly significant intelligence triumph of the U.S. Navy during the Cold War. Next,\nunlike HUMINT, SIGINT can be conducted remotely, thereby reducing the risk to human\nassets. If the proper installation can be expeditiously carried out, the lead time for\n127\nSIGINT can be quite short. Moreover, in some (but not all) cases, the expense of\nengaging in SIGINT operations can be small. That said, in the aggregate, SIGINT is\nexpensive. Although actual budget figures are classified, it is estimated that NSA\u2019s\nbudget alone is several billion dollars, much greater than that of the FBI.\nBox 4.7\n \nOperation Ivy Bells\nBy the early 1970s, America was deeply engaged in the Cold War against the\nCommunist East. A major foe was the mighty Soviet Navy. The IC believed that an\nundersea communications cable connected the Soviet Pacific Fleet with its\nheadquarters. The problem was, the cable was located 400 feet underwater in the\nSea of Okhotsk, which the Soviets claimed as their own sovereign territory.\nWorking with the NSA and CIA, the Navy devised an audacious plan to \u201ctap\u201d the\ncable. A nuclear-powered submarine surreptitiously entered the sea. Specially\ntrained divers soon found the cable and attached a device that recorded all the\nconversations that flowed through it. Believing their communications security to be\nintact, the Soviet high command talked quite openly with the fleet, hardly\ndisguising what they were saying at all. Every month, a U.S. submarine returned to\nexchange tapes.\nAlthough the exact conversations recorded by Operation Ivy Bells remain\nclassified, most experts believe that the United States developed intelligence of\nextraordinary value. In 1981, a Soviet salvage ship was discovered over the location\nof the Ivy Bells equipment. The next time the submarine \nUSS Parche\n went to\nretrieve the tapes, the crew found that the recording device had been removed. The\noperation had been compromised by an NSA analyst named Ronald Pelton. Today,\nthe Ivy Bells equipment is on display at a Moscow museum.\nSource:\n Sontag, S. et al. (1998). Blind man\u2019s bluff: The untold story of American\nsubmarine espionage. New York: PublicAffairs.\nToday, SIGINT is obtained in a variety of ways. From listening posts located across\nthe planet, to satellites that stay in geosynchronous orbit above a particular target, to\nspecially equipped Navy ships, the level of sophistication of platforms that intercept\nelectronic emissions has grown exponentially.\nThat said, much good information is available in the world without the use of\nexpensive eavesdropping equipment. Consider how much information each of us\nwillingly disseminates in the electronic ether, through social networking sites such as\nFacebook and Twitter. For far too many of us, OPSEC (operational security) is a distant\nand abstract concept. It is little wonder that identity theftis America\u2019s fastest growing\ncrime.\n128\nThe Special Case of \u201cChatter\u201d\nInformation does not have to be right on target, specific to a single topic, or even\ntranslatable to be of value. Consider the case of \nchatter\n, which refers to untranslatable\nor nonspecific pieces of information from a target of interest. Even if analysts do not\nknow what the communications mean, they monitor the volume for clues to upcoming\nevents. For example, when the level of chatter increases, it may mean that an operation\nis getting close to being launched. If the chatter increases and then \u201cgoes dark,\u201d it may\nmean that an operation is imminent. In the months leading up to the 9/11 attacks, the\nchatter of suspected terrorists and their supporters was unusually high. This led many in\nthe IC to believe, correctly, that something was about to happen.\nLaw Enforcement Operations\nAlthough the NSA primarily carries out SIGINT internationally, like the CIA, it cannot\nspy upon American citizens. Domestic intelligence and terrorism wiretaps are\nadministered by the FBI. The Foreign Intelligence Surveil-lance Act (FISA), passed in\n1978, regulates how domestic SIGINT operations can be carried out (see \nChapter 10\n,\n\u201cConstitutional Mandates\u2014Overview of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Roles\u201d). A\nfederal judge must approve all FISA wiretaps. However, unlike criminal wiretaps, which\nare approved by judges in the judicial district where the overhears occur, the FISA court\nis located in Washington, D.C. The judges possess a security clearance, which allows\nthem to hear classified evidence. In this way, both judicial oversight and the protection\nof sources and methods are preserved.\nGeospatial Intelligence\nAccording to Section 467 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code, GEOINT is defined as:\n[T]he exploitation and analysis of imagery and geospatial information to describe, assess, and visually depict\nphysical features and geographically \nreferenced activities on the earth. Geospatial intelligence consists of\nimagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information. (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 467)\nAlthough many in the IC utilize GEOINT, the two U.S. agencies most closely associated\nwith it are the National Geospatial\u2013Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National\nReconnaissance Office (NRO).\nIn a nutshell, GEOINT refers to imaging characteristics of the physical earth, usually\nfrom the air. This can include natural features, such as mountains and rivers, or man-\nmade structures. The advent of \ngeographic information systems\n (GIS) has made it\nmuch easier to associate GEOINT materials with their precise locations. Today\u2019s readers\nhave GEOINT at their fingertips\u2014freely available programs like Google Earth and\nMapQuest provide good resolution renditions of significant portions of the planet. It is\n129\ndifficult to believe that, up until a few years ago, capabilities such as this were the\ndomain of only a few governments.\nGiven the above, it is only natural to assume that GEOINT is a new intelligence\ndiscipline, one that was made possible by high flying spy planes and satellites. That\nwould be wrong, however. In fact, surveyors, such as a young George Washington, could\nbe considered the first practitioners of GEOINT in North America. As far back as the\nCivil War, President Abraham Lincoln tried to convince his skeptical generals to send up\nan observer in a balloon to monitor Confederate troop movements.\nWhen it was first developed, GEOINT was termed \nimagery intelligence\n or \nIMINT\n. In\nfact, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 467 still contains a definition for IMINT and some IC \u201cold timers\u201d still\nuse the term, but it is increasingly considered obsolete.\nThe latter part of the nineteenth century proved to be a period of intense development\nin the fledging aviation industry. As humans got closer and closer to developing heavier-\nthan-air flight, there was great interest in using aerial platforms to conduct surveillance\nand reconnaissance. All manner of techniques were tried\u2014balloons, blimps, rockets,\ngliders, even pigeons were outfitted with cameras to photograph the ground below. By\nWorld War I, aerial photography had demonstrated its value in battle. Improvements in\naviation technology between the wars meant that, by the start of World War II, IMINT\nhad become standard in all modern militaries. Regular airplanes and blimps, occasionally\nwith some modifications, became the primary means of gathering information (see \nBox\n4.8\n for a modern-day take on an old form of IMINT collection).\nBox 4.8\n \nPentagon\u2019s New Spy Blimp: The more Things\nChange \u2026\nBlimps were one of the first aerial platforms used for surveillance. Because they\nhave the ability to hover over targets for long periods of time, they can provide\nexcellent coverage of unfolding battles or developing situations. However, their\nlarge size and slow speed make them highly vulnerable to attack.\nAfter World War II, use of the airships declined rapidly. In the intervening years,\nspy planes and satellites took over the majority of the GEOINT missions.\nToday, however, the Pentagon appears to be returning to the \u201cgood old days.\u201d In\n2009, military officials stated that they were allocating $400 million to develop a\n450-ft dirigible that will float 65,000 feet above the Earth for a period of up to 10\nyears. The military plans to deploy these dirigibles over \u201cflashpoints\u201d where\nconstant situational awareness over a wide area is crucial; officials cited the\nAfghanistan\u2013Pakistan border as one such area.\nOther than the fact that they will be lighter-than-air, these new airships will bear\nlittle resemblance to their early twentieth century cousins. They will be equipped\nwith state-of-the-art radar and imaging equipment that will be able to detect even\nthe smallest of movements. In addition, the dirigibles will use solar panels to\n130\nrecharge hydrogen fuel cells, thereby allowing for the extended hover capability.\nBecause they will operate at 65,000 feet, they will be all but invisible to ground\nobservers and will remain beyond the range of most fighter aircraft and shoulder-\nfired weapons.\nSource:\n Barnes, J. (2009). \nLos Angeles Times\n.\nhttp://articles.latimes.com/2009/mar/13/nation/na-spyblimp13\n.\nGEOINT really came into its own during the Cold War. Much of the Soviet arsenal,\nwhich consisted of large armies, ships, air wings, and eventually missiles, was visible\nfrom the air. Initially, World War II era aircraft, such as the Boeing B-29 Superfortress,\nwere reconfigured for reconnaissance duty. Although details of many of these missions\nremain classified, it is known that they flew close to the Soviet Union to probe Soviet\ndefenses, monitor atomic tests, and intercept communications.\nIt soon became clear that reconfigured bombers and the like were not adequate for the\nsophisticated surveillance needs of the Cold War. Accordingly, both sides began to\ndevelop aircraftstrictly for reconnaissance purposes. The U-2, as described in \nBox 4.3\n,\nwas the first such design. However, it would not be the last. The shoot-down of Francis\nGary Powers in 1960 demonstrated the U-2\u2019s is vulnerability to Soviet missiles. As a\nresult, the IC contemplated a faster, higher-flying design. By 1964, the highly classified\nLockheed \u201cSkunk Works\u201d plant had produced the SR-71, an airplane that could cruise at\nMach 3+ (three times faster than the speed of sound) at altitudes beyond 80,000 ft.\nNicknamed the \u201cBlackbird\u201d for its sleek shape and dark color, the SR-71 was almost more\na spaceship than an aircraft. Because of its extreme ceiling, the two-person crew wore\npressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts. The Blackbird was an amazing craft;\nif attacked by a missile, the pilots simply accelerated\u2014no missile could catch it. The SR-\n71 entered service in 1966 and remained active until 1991 (National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration, 2009).\nCurrently, most of the SR-71\u2019s former missions are performed by satellites.\nInterestingly, the aircraftstayed active even after satellites had been developed. Why was\nthis so? Unlike satellites whose orbits are difficult to change, aircraftcan fly over\nvirtually any target on earth at short notice. This is essential for fast-breaking situations,\nsuch as the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.\nBy the mid-1950s, U.S. experts recognized the potential for satellites as reconnaissance\nplatforms. However, at that time the Soviets had a lead in space technology. Soviet\ndominance was made painfully clear in October 1957 with the launch of Sputnik, the\nfirst artificial satellite to orbit the earth. Although Sputnik itself had few capabilities, the\nimplications were clear\u2014the Soviet Union would soon develop the capability to spy and\ndeliver nuclear weapons from space. No defense against either of these threats was\navailable or likely in the 1950s.\nThe United States embarked on a crash program to gain parity. At first, the results\nwere dismal. However, by 1960, things had improved. In that year, America began test\n131\nlaunches of its CORONA Program, which would last into the 1970s. CORONA was an\ninteresting concept. A rocket would launch a camera into orbit carrying massive\nquantities of film. When the mission was finished, the film would be parachuted to earth\nwhere it was recovered in midair by an airplane. Despite the seemingly outlandish\npremise, the CORONA program proved successful. Today, many spy satellites from\ndifferent countries orbit the globe. Their capabilities for spotting even small objects on\nthe ground are remarkable. Not surprisingly, these types of GEOINT programs remain\nhighly classified.\nIn recent years, a new form of GEOINT has made a dramatic debut. Unmanned aerial\nvehicles (UAVs), such as the Predator and Global Hawk, now routinely fly over the skies\nof battle zones. First deployed strictly as reconnaissance collectors, these unmanned\ndrones are operated by pilots who can be thousands of miles away. The first UAV that\nreceived signifi-cant use was the Predator. Introduced in the mid-1990s, the Predator has\na range of 400 nautical miles and can hover over a target location for 14 hours. Operated\nby both the Air Force and the CIA, the Predator has seen service \nin Afghanistan,\nPakistan, Bosnia, Serbia, Iraq, Yemen, Libya, and Somalia. After the Predator was\ndeployed in Afghanistan, the CIA decided to arm it with Hellfire missiles. The results\nproved quite successful. To date, UAVs have been responsible for quite a few \u201ckills\u201d of\nhigh value terrorists. This action has not been without controversy. In late September\n2011, a UAV fired a missile that killed Anwar al-Awlaki and Samir Khan, two well-\nknown al Qa\u2019ida leaders who were also U.S. citizens (the attack occurred in Yemen).\nSome have criticized the Obama Administration for putting out a \u201chit list\u201d on Americans\nwhen they believe it would be far more appropriate to try them in court. Others counter\nthat this is impractical and that these individuals should be treated like enemy soldiers in\nwartime, regardless of their citizenship. Moreover, countries such as Yemen and Pakistan\nroutinely object when individuals are killed by the United States in their sovereign\nterritory (see generally Gertler, 2012).\nDespite these objections, there is little reason to believe that UAV strikes will end\nanytime soon. According to a recent \nWashington Post\n report, UAVs have been\nresponsible for the deaths of 2000 suspected militants and civilians since 2001; currently,\nmore that 20% of the CIA\u2019s analytical workforce is employed as \ntargeters\n, who scan\nmyriad data sources looking for individuals to recruit, arrest, or kill (Miller & Tate, 2011).\nGEOINT provides many benefits. Although exact resolutions remain classified,\ntoday\u2019s sophisticated cameras can record great detail even from high up in space. They\nare excellent collection platforms for certain forms of information, such as structures on\nthe ground, troops, buildings of interest, and the like. GEOINT was of major use during\nthe Cold War. The images of Soviet missiles and support equipment on the ground were\nessential in allowing the Kennedy Administration to defuse the Cuban Missile Crisis in\n1962. More recently, imagery of Osama bin Laden\u2019s compound in Pakistan verified his\nlikely presence there and helped to plan the raid that killed him.\nHowever, GEOINT has drawbacks as well. In the first place, it can be exceptionally\nexpensive. In addition, one cannot easily maneuver a satellite in orbit to cover a target.\n132\nGiven the fact that many satellites are in orbit, targets can avoid detection if they know\nwhen the satellite will pass overhead (some satellites are in geosynchronous orbit, which\nmeans they remain virtually stationary over a target and can gather data for long periods\nof time). Moreover, disinformation can be employed to \u201cfool\u201d GEOINT. As far back as\nWorld War I, dummy and inflatable tanks, ships, and airplanes were constructed to\nthrow offthe enemy\u2019s aerial surveillance. As well, GEOINT needs to be interpreted,\nwhich can prove difficult. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet intelligence officer\nnamed Oleg Penkovsky passed plans and descriptions of Soviet missile equipment to the\nUnited States that allowed analysts to identify what was being deployed in Cuba.\nWithout his help, interpretation would have \nbeen difficult if not impossible. In addition,\nphotographic imagery can be affected by weather\u2014a cloudy day can make satellite\nphotographs worthless.\nDespite this, GEOINT is an important form of collection. The continued development\nof satellites, UAVs, and GIS systems will no doubt only make GEOINT more viable in\nthe future.\nMeasurement and Signatures Intelligence\nNorth Korea is a closed society. In recent years, the North Koreans claimed to have\ndeveloped and tested nuclear weapons. Yet, the regime has not allowed foreign observers\nto monitor these tests, and in the past their reports have not always been trustworthy.\nCould their claims be verified? Since direct verification was not possible, the\ninternational community tried to indirectly determine whether North Korea exploded a\nnuclear weapon. First, experts monitored seismic activity. Since they knew how much\nthe ground should shake from the detonation of a nuclear device, they compared that to\nthe actual data that was collected. Next, since nuclear explosions release radiation, they\nmonitored radionuclide data from fixed stations and from specially equipped\naircraftflying in the Sea of Japan. Their conclusion? The North Koreans \u201cprobably\u201d\ndetonated a nuclear device.\nThese indirect measurements of technical data are considered measurement and\nsignatures intelligence (MASINT). As the name implies, the \u201cmeasurement\u201d portion\nconcerns the actual measurement of data, whereas the \u201csignatures\u201d part concerns finding\nenough distinctive features in the data to determine its origin, source, or function. There\nhas been a recent move to change the MASINT designation to Technical Intelligence or\nAdvanced Technical Intelligence. This is attributable in part to technical advances in\nother collection platforms that also measure data (e.g., GEOINT, SIGINT); some feel that\nMASINT is actually more of an analytical technique that involves many of the \u201cINTs.\u201d\nNaturally, the military is very interested in the technical capabilities of its potential\nadversaries; as a result, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) is very involved in\nMASINT. According to a 1997 report, these are some of the areas that DIA considers\nimportant (Rau, 1997):\n133\nNuclear, chemical, and biological features\nEmitted energy (e.g., nuclear, thermal, and electromagnetic)\nReflected energy (e.g., radio frequency, light, and sound)\nMechanical sound (e.g., machinery noise)\nMagnetic properties (e.g., magnetic flux and anomalies)\nMotion (e.g., flight, vibration, or movement)\nMaterial composition\nUnlike many other disciplines, MASINT is a relatively new field; it really came into its\nown in the latter half of the twentieth century as technology became more widespread\nand sophisticated. As a result, engineers, chemists, biologists, and other professionals\nwith technical degrees are increasingly in high demand in today\u2019s IC.\nMASINT has obvious pluses. It is essential for understanding certain targets, such as\nthat outlined in the North Korean example above. As well, its technical precision allows\nit to avoid some of the \u201cuncertainties and ambiguities\u201d that often accompany other forms\nof intelligence. For example, when an analyst \u201creverse engineers\u201d a Russian weapons\nsystem, he or she can be quite confident in estimates of speed, range, and destructive\npotential.\nOf course, MASINT can be expensive. In addition, its highly technical nature often\nrequires analysts with advanced degrees in engineering and the sciences. It can\nsometimes be challenging to reduce some highly technical information to terms that the\nlaity can understand (few policymakers are also nuclear engineers). Although analysis\ncan be remote, actually gathering data can be dangerous (see \nBox 4.9\n).\nBox 4.9\n \nThe Sudanese Pharmaceutical Factory: Was it\nor Wasn\u2019t it?\nIn 1998, al Qa\u2019ida attacked U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi,\nKenya, killing hundreds. At the time, Osama bin Laden was believed to have had\nlinks with Sudan, despite his 1996 expulsion from that country. The Clinton\nAdministration decided to retaliate against countries that it believed supported the\nterrorist group. A clandestine CIA team arrived secretly in Sudan; the Americans\nhad received information that the al-Shifa Pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum was,\nin fact, manufacturing chemical weapons. The team retrieved a sample of soil just\noutside the factory. When it was analyzed, traces of O-ethyl\nmethylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a precursor of VX nerve gas, were\ndiscovered.\nThis prompted the United States to launch a cruise missile attack against the\nfactory, which was destroyed with accompanying loss of life. However, critics soon\npointed out that the EMPTA could have come from a source other than inside the\nplant. Moreover, EMPTA is used in other things besides VX gas.\n134\nTo this day, controversy remains. Some former administration officials\nsteadfastly maintain that the plant was a WMD factory, a claim the Sudanese deny.\nMoreover, critics contend that the attack ultimately caused several thousand deaths\nin Sudan from medicinal shortages as a result of the destruction of an important\nfactory.\nSource:\n Risen, J.

An oft-used statement in the intelligence and law enforcement\ncommunities is \u201cfollow the money.\u201d\nTo that end, financial intelligence (FININT) is an important function in any\ninvestigation. In many cases, financial records abound. Banks and financial institutions\nare required to maintain detailed records. Often, these provide significant information\nregarding the way groups and individuals operate. In other cases, groups attempt to\ndisguise their fiduciary records; they may attempt to make their transactions appear to\ncome from legitimate sources or they may try to hide them altogether. In either case, the\nIC has skilled analysts who can determine the true nature of financial dealings.\nThe Department of the Treasury operates the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\n(FinCEN). Utilized by both the law enforcement and intelligence communities, FinCEN\u2019s\nmission is:\n\u2026 to enhance U.S. national security, deter and detect criminal activity, and safeguard financial systems from\nabuse by promoting transparency in the U.S. and international financial systems. (FinCEN, n.d.)\nFinCEN personnel use the tools of forensic accounting to uncover the financial activity\nof an individual or group. Oftentimes, this can be a tedious and laborious process.\nCriminals and terrorists may have intricate financial webs to disguise their activities.\nWith regard to al Qa\u2019ida, the 9\u201311 Commission wrote (National Commission on\nTerrorist Attacks upon the United States, 2004: 17):\nAl Qa\u2019ida has developed \u201can elusive network \u2026 an unconventional web\u201d to support itself, its operations, and its\npeople. Al Qa\u2019ida has demonstrated the ability, both before and after 9/11, to raise money from many different\nsources, typically using a cadre of financial facilitators, and to move this money through its organization by a\nvariety of conduits, including hawaladars \u2026 couriers, and financial institutions. These sources and conduits are\nresilient, redundant, and difficult to detect.\nBox 4.10\n discusses one method that terrorists use to transfer funds. It is called \u201cHawala,\u201d\nwhich is an ancient banking system that exists in many parts of the world. Both licit and\n135\nillicit activities are conducted using the Hawala system.\nBox 4.10\n \nWhat is Hawala?\nAccording to FinCEN\u2019s Patrick Jost (page 5):\nHawala is an alternative or parallel remittance system. It exists and operates outside of, or parallel to,\n\u201ctraditional\u201d banking or financial channels. It was developed in India before the introduction of Western\nbanking practices, and it is currently a major remittance system used around the world. It is but one of\nseveral such systems; another well-known example is the \u201cchop,\u201d \u201cchit,\u201d or \u201cflying money\u201d system\nindigenous to China. These systems are often referred to as \u201cunderground banking\u201d; this term is not\nalways correct, as they often operate in the open with complete legitimacy, and these services are often\nheavily and effectively advertised.\nThe components of hawala that distinguish it from other remittance systems are trust and the extensive\nuse of connections such as family relationships or regional affiliations.\nUnlike traditional banking or even the \u201cchop\u201d system, hawala makes minimal (often no) use of any sort of\nnegotiable instrument. Transfers of money take place based on communications between members of a\nnetwork of hawaladars, or hawala dealers.\nSource:\n Jost, P. (2009). The Hawala alternative remittance system and its role in\nmoney laundering. Vienna, VA: Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.\nFININT is an excellent source of information. However, its analysis can be laborious\nand tedious. Additionally, the courts have recognized that financial information is very\npersonal; as a result, laws have been passed restricting its dissemination. Often, a grand\njury subpoena is needed to obtain banking information. Additionally, certain countries\nprovide a great deal of protection to financial records, making it next to impossible to\nobtain any information. More informal systems, like Hawala, utilize few records.\nTherefore, it may be very difficult to trace transactions.\nAnalysts who deal in financial analysis require special skills. Oftentimes, they hold\ndegrees in accounting or are designated certified public accountants. The field of\nclandestine financial analysis is very specialized. Organizations such as the FBI\u2019s\nCryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit possess experts who have studied for years\nto obtain their certification.\nOpen Source Intelligence\nThere is a perception that only classified information is \u201cgood\u201d information; nothing\ncould be further from the truth. In fact, much good information is unclassified\u2014it is in\nthe \u201copen.\u201d This is especially true today, in a world \nwhere we are inundated with\ninformation. Consider the thousands of newspapers, television stations, and radio\nnetworks that operate. Add to that all the information available on the internet. The\n136\ndifficulty for the IC is often not a lack of information\u2014rather, it is separating the \u201cwheat\u201d\nfrom the \u201cchaff.\u201d As mentioned previously, today\u2019s \u201chaystacks\u201d are exponentially larger\nthan they ever have been.\nThe IC has long recognized the value of open source information. If you ever travel\ninside the CIA\u2019s or FBI\u2019s operations centers where conflicts are managed, you will see\nwalls lined with television sets. During a crisis, it is not unusual to see them tuned to\nCNN, MSNBC, or Fox News. That is because the media is often the first to broadcast\nbreaking events. Add to that all the good analysis that gets published by universities,\nthink tanks, and even blogs\u2014the IC would be foolish not to consider this intelligence.\nIn 2005, the WMD Commission issued a report to the President discussing intelligence\nshortfalls in the IC. The Commission was vociferous in promoting open source\nintelligence (OSINT) for the following reasons (Commission on the Intelligence\nCapabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, 2005: 378\u2013\n379):\nThe ever-shifting nature of our intelligence needs compels the Intelligence\nCommunity to quickly and easily understand a wide range of foreign countries\nand cultures \u2026. Increasingly, Intelligence Community professionals need to\nquickly assimilate social, economic, and cultural information about a country\u2014\ninformation often detailed in open sources.\nOpen source information provides a base for understanding classified materials\n\u2026. Perhaps the most important example today relates to terrorism, where open\nsource information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better\nunderstand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of\nattack, and potential targets.\nOpen source materials can protect sources and methods.\nOnly open source can \u201cstore history.\u201d A robust open source program can, in\neffect, gather data to monitor the world\u2019s cultures and how they change with\ntime.\nIn 2005, the DNI established the Open Source Center, whose mission is to make available\nopen source materials from the internet, databases, press, radio, television, video,\ngeospatial data, photos, and commercial imagery. This also includes translated material\nfrom foreign sources.\nOpen source material is clearly valuable. Indeed, anyone reading this book could\nbecome an open source analyst. However, care must be taken. In the \nfirst place, the sheer\nvolume of material available today is overwhelming; one must develop a clear collection\nstrategy to access the \u201cwheat\u201d while avoiding the \u201cchaff.\u201d Second, it is difficult to gauge\nthe credibility of open source data. Something may sound plausible when, in fact, it is\nentirely off base. Open source information is especially vulnerable to denial and\ndeception\u2014 consider all the \u201cinformation\u201d that makes its way to the internet without\nscrutiny. How much of it is actually true?\n137\nConclusion\nCollection is at the very heart of the intelligence endeavor. In terms of both resources\nand risk, it is the most \u201cexpensive\u201d part of the cycle. Nevertheless, it is crucial to have\ngood, credible, wide-ranging information about the world around us. In the past, the IC\nwas concerned about a few critical issues, such as the Soviet Union. Today\u2019s threats and\nchallenges, however, are quite broad. In his \nVision 2015\n publication, the DNI outlined no\nfewer than 14 \u201cpersistent threats and emerging missions\u201d for the IC. These run the gamut\nfrom space, to financial markets, to crime, to even climate change. Clearly, these are\nsignificant challenges. They require an eclectic group of individuals with the ability to\naccess myriad sources of data, ranging from highly technical publications to street thugs\nwho possess knowledge of terrorist cells. Tomorrow\u2019s collectors may be scientists or\nseasoned detectives; they will not conform neatly to the James Bond stereotype often\nassociated with spying.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nIf you were a policymaker, what are some of the considerations you would use\nin formulating a collection plan?

Despite good intentions and bright, motivated analysts, the\nintelligence community (IC) has often failed to predict major events and has gotten\nassessments dead wrong (see \nBox 5.1\n for various examples). As the quote from former\nCIA analyst Richards Heuer at the beginning of \nChapter 6\n (\u201cAnalytical Methods\u201d) makes\nclear, the problem generally rests with analysis, not collection. In this chapter, we discuss\nsome of the barriers to successful analysis. As readers will soon discover, this \nhas as\nmuch to do with the manner in which the human brain is \u201cwired\u201d as it does with\nexternal pressures or incomplete information. We begin with the analyst himself and\nsome of the personal and cognitive challenges we all face as humans. We then move to\nmore external factors, such as political and organizational pressures and constraints.\n142\nMurky World of the IC\nAnalysts exist in a world rife with uncertainty and ambiguity. Of course, every country\ntries mightily to protect its valuable secrets. Policymakers and leaders often try to keep\ntheir strategies and intentions to themselves, hoping to gain strategic advantage over\nboth allies and enemies. \nBox 5.2\n presents the analogy of the jigsaw puzzle to describe the\nlife of an analyst. Like most analogies, it oversimplifies and generalizes the situation;\nnevertheless, we think it gives some insight into the challenges of analysis.\n143\nPsychological Barriers\nBox 5.2\n \nThe Jigsaw Puzzle Analogy\nEveryone has assembled a jigsaw puzzle at one time in their life. Imagine trying to\ndo it without a box top picture to guide you. Additionally, someone has removed\nseveral pieces of the puzzle. Finally, pieces from other puzzles have been mixed in\nto throw you off. Such is the world of the IC analyst.\nAnyone who has taken a course in economics has heard of the \u201crational actor.\u201d In simple\nterms, this is an individual who can take in all manner of information, objectively and\ndispassionately weigh the costs and benefits of a particular course of action, and act to\nmaximize personal gain; in other words, act like a minicomputer. Many social science\ntheories are predicated on individuals acting \u201crationally.\u201d However, in the 1950s, Herbert\nSimon, who was schooled in economics, political science, and psychology, noted that\npeople often do not act rationally in their decision-making. Indeed, even when they try\nto be objective, their rationality is often \u201cbounded\u201d by cognitive and environmental\nlimitations. For example, individuals often do not have the time to consider their every\ndecision deeply (this can be especially true in the intelligence world where analysts are\ncontinually under pressure to arrive at decisions that policy makers \u201cneeded yesterday\u201d).\nFurthermore, the human brain appears to be \u201cwired\u201d for quick decision-making that is,\nhopefully, \u201cgood enough\u201d for the situation. In an evolutionary sense, this \nmakes\ncomplete sense. Imagine you are a cave person confronted with a saber-toothed tiger;\nyou have a very limited amount of time to make a decision but, thankfully, few decisions\nfrom which to choose\u2014you can freeze, flee, or fight. Hopefully, you will have chosen\nwisely!\nSimon termed his theory \nbounded rationality\n and his \u201cgood enough\u201d model of\ndecision-making \nsatisficing\n (arriving at the first acceptable, rather than optimal,\ndecision). In his model, the brain lacks the capacity to consider every fact at hand;\ninstead, it develops \nheuristics\n, or \u201cshortcuts,\u201d to facilitate rapid decision-making.\nHeuristics develop over time and are strongly informed by experience. As long as\ncurrent and future events strongly resemble past ones, this can be beneficial (what\nworked in outwitting the saber toothed tiger the first time around will probably work\nagain). However, as situations increase in complexity, there is a tendency for our brains\nto oversimplify them; we end up making decisions based on incomplete information (see\nGigerenzer & Selten, 2002).\nSimon\u2019s work influenced Richards Heuer, who served in the CIA\u2019s Directorates of\n144\nOperations and Intelligence. In the 1970s and 1980s, Heuer authored a series of articles\non cognitive biases and their effect on decision-making as related to intelligence\nanalysis. These articles were compiled into a book that has since become a classic in the\nIC, the \nPsychology of Intelligence Analysis\n. Heuer\u2019s central premise was that analysts\nneed to understand the \u201chows\u201d and \u201cwhys\u201d of evaluating evidence and reaching\nconclusions; in particular, they need to appreciate how the \u201cwiring\u201d of their brains makes\nit difficult to reach objective, unbiased conclusions. In other words, they should spend\nconsiderable time \u201cthinking about thinking.\u201d In this way, they can recognize and\nameliorate biases. Much of what Heuer discussed had been previously discovered by\npsychologists and sociologists; his major contribution was applying it to analysis.\nAlthough the brain is a complex organism whose functions are not completely\nunderstood, Heuer noted that the mind is an active rather than a passive organism\u2014it\ndoes not merely receive input and reflect upon it. Instead, the brain is constantly in\naction, actively trying to make sense of the world around it. Consider an example:\nArocdnicg to rsceearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn\u2019t mttaer in waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the\nolny iprmoatnt tihng is taht the frist and lsat ltteer are in the rghit pcale.\nMost readers have no trouble reading this as:\nAccording to research at Cambridge University, it doesn\u2019t matter in what order the letters in a word are, the\nonly important thing is that the first and last letter are in the right place.\nWhy is this the case? According to Heuer, \u201cWe tend to perceive what we expect to\nperceive.\u201d In other words, all of us are familiar with proper sentence construction; we\nknow, or think we know, what the writer intended. As a result, our brain cancels out\nunneeded or obviously incorrect information and \u201csees\u201d what it expects. Heuer had this\nto say generally with regard to \nperception\n (Heuer, 1999: 7):\nThe process of perception links people to their environment and is critical to accurate understanding of the\nworld about us. Accurate intelligence analysis obviously requires accurate perception. Yet research into human\nperception demonstrates that the process is beset by many pitfalls. Moreover, the circumstances under which\nintelligence analysis is conducted are precisely the circumstances in which accurate perception tends to be most\ndifficult.\nIn other words, analysts\u2019 brains may miss subtle changes in the world around them.\nObviously, too many subtle changes ultimately lead to big ones down the road. Consider\nthis example\u2014if one throws a frog into a pot of boiling water, it will attempt to jump\nout. If, on the other hand, one places a frog in a pot of warm water and gradually raises\nthe temperature to the boiling point, it will not notice the change (do not try this at\nhome).\nHeuer also discussed the concept of \nmindsets\n, or ways of looking at things; they\ndescribe what we think we know of the world around us. Mindsets are not static; their\nformation is affected by education, experience, and culture. However, Heuer noted that\nmindsets are quick to form and slow to change. As one develops expertise in a particular\narea, mindsets tend to solidify; for this reason, when radical change comes along such as\n145\nthe fall of the Soviet Union, senior personnel may be the last to realize that something\ntruly earth shattering is about to occur. Ironically, it is the senior people, the recognized\nexperts, whom policymakers most trust in times of crisis. As Heuer puts it (1999: 5):\n\u201cWhen faced with a major paradigm shift, analysts who know the most about a subject\nhave the most to unlearn.\u201d\nOne particularly vexatious mindset bias, and one that causes major headaches for the\nIC, is termed \nmirror imaging\n, or the \u201ceverybody thinks like we do\u201d mindset. In other\nwords, analysts view facts and patterns of a situation and assume that people of other\ncountries and cultures will choose the same way they would in the same situation. Of\ncourse, this is a dangerous and usually incorrect assumption. This can be especially\nproblematic for analysts in the U.S. IC, given America\u2019s insular history and culture. For\nthis reason, it is important for analysts to have an appreciation for the culture of the\ncountry or area they are studying; living abroad, even for a short time, provides\nprospective analysts with at least some knowledge of different cultures. Porch \nand Wirtz\n(2002) partially blame America\u2019s failure to predict the Pearl Harbor attacks by the\nJapanese on mirror imaging:\nIt seemed inconceivable to the U.S. planners in 1941 that the Japanese would be so foolish to attack a power\nwhose resources so exceeded those of Japan, thus virtually guaranteeing defeat.\nTo the Japanese, the attack made sense. In the first place, they wanted to damage the\nAmerican Navy so they would be able to attack the Dutch East Indies and Malaya\nwithout U.S. interference. They also hoped to severely damage American morale, so\nmuch so that the United States would think long and hard about attacking Japan; in this,\nthe Japanese decision-makers may have engaged in their own sort of mirror imaging by\nunderestimating American anger and resolve.\nOver the years, researchers have identified many biases in which people routinely\nengage. Because of the sheer number, we will only discuss the ones that have the\ngreatest effect on analysis.\nOne of the most important biases is \nfundamental attribution error\n, also termed\ncorrespondence bias or attribution effect, which describes the tendency to attribute the\nbehavior of others to their personalities or individual skills while undervaluing\nsituational explanations for those behaviors. For example, if Sally fails a test, you may\nattribute that to her low IQ; if, on the other hand, you fail the test, you may blame it on\nan \u201cunfair\u201d teacher or the environmental conditions of the room (e.g., it was too cold to\nconcentrate).\nIn the intelligence world, this type of bias can have dire consequences. For example,\nwhen trying to determine whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction\n(WMDs) before invading Iraq in 2003, many analysts approached the problem with the\nmindset that Hussein was a crafty sociopath\u2014 not the type of person who would give up\nWMDs willingly. Had they better appreciated that the tense relationship between Iraq\nand Iran at the time might have motivated Hussein to \nappear\n to have these types of\nweapons even when he did not, their conclusions might have been quite different.\n146\nIndividuals also show a bias to recall better the information they have learned in the\nrecent past rather than what they learned a long time ago. Termed the \nrecency effect\n,\nunder some circumstances this makes complete sense. For example, if a country starts to\npurchase nuclear components after years of evidence suggest they have no interest in\njoining the nuclear club of nations, it may signal a shiftin strategic direction. On the\nother hand, if after years of pleasant dining at a restaurant, you conclude it is \u201cno good\u201d\nbecause they undercooked your hamburger yesterday, you are overlooking substantial\nevidence that it is, in fact, a wonderful place; perhaps the cook was having an off day.\nAnalysts take care to \u201clook at the big picture\u201d and weigh all different types of evidence\nappropriately.\nRelated to the recency effect is \navailability bias\n, or the tendency to attach the most\ncredence to the information that is most easily retrieved from our memories. In some\ncases, this may be the material we learned most recently (recency effect); however, this\nis not always the case. Information associated with a big or highly emotional event in\nour lives, such as the birth of a child, a passionate romance, or the death of a close\nfriend, will stay with us forever. Heuer uses the example of smoking and spying to\nillustrate this point (Heuer, 1999: 148):\nConsider two people who are smokers. One had a father who died of lung cancer, whereas the other does not\nknow anyone who ever had lung cancer. The one whose father died of lung cancer will normally perceive a\ngreater probability of adverse health consequences associated with smoking, even though one more case of lung\ncancer is statistically insignificant when weighing such risk. How about two CIA officers, one of whom knew\n[convicted CIA spy] Aldrich Ames and the other who did not personally know anyone who had ever turned out\nto be a traitor? Which one is likely to perceive the greatest risk of insider betrayal?\nAnother way that information becomes prioritized in our brains is through personal,\nrather than secondhand, exposure to it. In most cases, personally experiencing a situation\nwill have much more of an impact than reading about it in a book. This is called the\nvividness criterion\n. Suppose analysts travel to a foreign country and have some unique\nand wonderful experiences. Upon their return to the United States, they are tasked by\ntheir employer, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), to write a report on the\nlikelihood of that country invading one of its neighbors. Despite solid evidence that this\ncould be a real possibility, the analysts are unconsciously affected by the great time they\nhad there and the lovely people they met; their subsequent report downplays the\nlikelihood of invasion.\nAnalysts also must remain cognizant to how they can cause this phenomenon in\nothers. Briefing is an essential skill for analysts to develop\u2014of course, everyone wants to\nbe the best briefer in the agency. But is it possible to be \ntoo\n good? Suppose you are a\ndynamic briefer, and your colleague Jack is not. You have been asked to assess the\nlikelihood that Iran is developing nuclear weapons; you decide that it is, and Jack decides\nit is not. This, in and of itself, is not a bad thing. It is important that policymakers\nunderstand all sides of an issue and hear different perspectives. Included in your briefing\nare colored photographs of nuclear missiles flying through the air and mushroom clouds\nrising over Midwestern American cities. Jack\u2019s briefing consists of innumerable mind-\n147\nnumbing charts and tables. You take care to explain that the missiles you have included\nare Russian, not Iranian, and that you are using them for illustrative purposes only. In\nthe end, the dignitaries in the room are captivated by your performance; unfortunately\nfor Jack, most stopped listening by the time he got to his 15th chart. The policymakers\nclearly side with you. Although this is certainly flattering and career enhancing, could it\nturn out to be a pyrrhic victory? Suppose Jack\u2019s case was actually stronger but your\nsuperior oratory skills carried the day. Now policymakers are making important\ndecisions without benefit of the best available intelligence. Does that not put the country\nat risk? Of course, policymakers should be able to see through smoke and mirrors and\njudge situations on their merit. But this does not always happen. Analysts, then, have a\nmoral responsibility to save the theatrics for their local community theater. \nBox 5.3\nprovides an example of how a vivid, powerful advertisement affected the 1964\npresidential election.\nMost humans are notoriously bad at judging probabilities, and yet analysts have to\nmake probabilistic judgments all the time. In \nChapter 11\n (\u201cWriting and Briefing for the\nIntelligence Community\u201d), we discuss the use of estimative language, which analysts use\nto inform policymakers of the confidence\nBox 5.3\n \nThe \u201cDaisy Girl\u201d Commercial\nThe 1964 presidential election was between President Lyndon Johnson and\nRepublican Senator Barry Goldwater. At the time, there was great concern over a\npossible nuclear war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Goldwater,\nan Air Force reserve officer, was known as a military \u201chawk\u201d who had once\ndiscussed the possibility of using nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. During the\nairing of a Monday night movie, the Johnson campaign aired a commercial that was\nconsidered so controversial that it\u2019s still discussed today (see \nFigure 5.1\n).\nThe commercial opens with a 4-year-old girl counting and picking the petals off\ndaisies in a meadow. When she gets to the number \u201cnine,\u201d a man\u2019s voice is heard in\nthe background counting down a missile launch. The camera zooms in on the little\ngirl\u2019s eyes looking into the sky\u2014at \u201czero,\u201d there is a huge flash followed by a\nmushroom cloud filling the sky. An announcer tells the audience that these are the\nstakes\u2014on November 3, they must vote for Lyndon Johnson.\nAlthough perhaps not controversial by today\u2019s standards, the \u201cDaisy Girl\u201d\ncommercial was considered so outrageous that it only aired once. Nevertheless, the\npoint had been made. Johnson ended up winning in a landslide; several historians\nare convinced that this commercial contributed measurably to his victory.\nSource:\n Kurson, K.

(Source: Courtesy of the\nLibrary of Congress, Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division)\nthey have in their analysis as determined by the amount of information available and the\ncredibility of their sources. Analysts do not need to be statisticians, but they should have\na good, fundamental knowledge of how to compute probabilities. Otherwise they risk\nfalling victim to \nrepresentative bias\n. Consider the following example:\nSandy is a Special Agent with the DEA. She has an informant, Greg, who regularly provides her with\ninformation. Greg is correct, on average, three out of four times. Recently, a large load of cocaine was discovered\nin a bus station locker with no data identifying the owner. Greg told Sandy that he had heard that someone from\nthe Hispanic community owned the load (he knew nothing else about the individual). The community is\napproximately 90% Non-Hispanic and 10% Hispanic. Sandy ordered investigation to be conducted in all Hispanic\nneighborhoods.\nAt first blush, this may seem like a reasonable strategy. After all, on average Greg is\nright more often than he\u2019s wrong. However, on closer inspection, the population of the\ntown is overwhelmingly non-Hispanic. That fact alone indicates that, absent anything\nelse, the perpetrator would likely not be Hispanic. Greg is correct 75% of the time; in this\ncase, he did not see the perpetrator but \u201cheard on the street\u201d that he was Hispanic. Could\nit be that this is one of the 25% of the time he\u2019s wrong? How did Greg\u2019s source obtain the\ninformation \nin the first place? Is it possible he surmised it based on media\nrepresentations of Hispanic cocaine dealers? In fact, when we do the math, it turns out\nthat Greg\u2019s less-than-perfect track record combined with the population demographics of\nthe town make it mathematically more probable that the offender is not Hispanic. The\ninability to reliably gauge probabilities, even qualitatively, is referred to as representative\nbias.\nJust as we humans have difficulty understanding statistics, many of us get confused\n149\nabout \ncause and effect\n. In the intelligence world, it is very important to understand\nwhether something causes something or not. For example, does poverty \ncause\n terrorism?\nIf we knew the answer to that, we could either intervene in poor communities to stop a\nproblem before it starts, or we could at least recognize where the next terrorism \u201chot\nspot\u201d may emerge.\nIn science, to be able to say that something \ncauses\n something else, one must meet\nstrict criteria. To say there is causation requires satisfying the following requirements:\nCorrelation\nTemporality\nControl of other variables\nCorrelation\n means there is a predictable relationship between two things. For example,\nthere is a correlation between weather and clothing: as the temperature goes down,\npeople wear more and warmer clothing. As it goes up, the opposite occurs. One of the\nmost famous quotes in science is that \u201ccorrelation does not imply causation!\u201d In other\nwords, the fact that two things predictably vary does not mean that a cause-and-effect\nrelationship exists; this saying came about precisely because too many people, some of\nthem scientists, forget this important rule.\nUsing the weather and clothing example above, does it make sense to say that because\npeople put on big jackets, the temperature goes down? Of course not. Thus, the second\nrequirement is \ntemporality\n, or being able to show that the cause of something occurred\nbefore\n its effect. In the above example, this is not difficult\u2014people consult thermometers\nand forecasts or stick their head outside the door before they decide whether to wear a\ncoat.\nThe final criterion is the \nability to control for other variables\n. After all, to say\nsomething causes something else, you want to be able to demonstrate that it, and only it,\nmade the difference. In the laboratory, it is possible to control for variables and alter\nonly the one under study through experimentation. In the world of social science and\nanalysis, however, it is very difficult to conduct \u201cpure\u201d experiments. Hence, we are often\nleftwith the difficult task of trying to understand \neverything\n, or at least as much as we\ncan, about the dynamics of the subject under study. Consider this:\nAs ice cream sales increase, the rate of drowning deaths increases sharply. Therefore, ice cream causes\ndrowning.\nWe have satisfied both the requirements of correlation and temporality but we know our\nconclusion is ridiculous. What went wrong? The problem is, there is an unstated\nconfounding variable\u2014the hot weather. People tend to eat ice cream and swim when it is\nhot. Hence, the actual relationship is between the weather and the other two\nphenomena. In our poverty and terrorism example, suppose we see a correlation between\nimpoverishment and the number of people who join terrorist organizations in country A.\nWe know that is not enough. As we examine things more deeply, we determine that, in\n150\ncountry A, the most reliable way out of poverty is to join the Army. Hence, a\ndisproportionately large number of poor people join. In the Army, people acquire skills,\nsuch as familiarity with explosives and other weapons that are also in high demand in\nterrorist groups. Once a person leaves the Army, there is a good chance that there will be\na relatively high paying job waiting for him or her in a terrorist organization. Given a\nlack of other more legitimate opportunities in country A, especially among the poor, this\nmay be quite appealing. Hence, what is really driving the issue is the terrorists\u2019 desire to\nbring aboard well-trained individuals, regardless of their economic background. Because\nof the demographics of the Army and the fact that those coming from richer\nbackgrounds may have more legitimate opportunities when they get out, we would\nexpect to see a large number of poor people entering the terrorist ranks\u2014but it is not\nbecause of anger at the government for their poor circumstances; rather it is a calculated\ndecision to maximize income by using skills that are in high demand. One way to check\non this would be to see whether poor people who did not join the Army turn to terrorism\nin the same numbers as those with a military background. If the answer is \u201cno,\u201d we may\nwant to further question the terrorism\u2013poverty link.\nThere are many other biases that affect intelligence analysis. These include:\nFallacy of Big Results/Big Cause\n: We tend to believe that \nbig\n results must have\nbig\n causes. For example, during the Cold War, many believed that only a\nnuclear attack could bring about the demise of the mighty Soviet Union. In fact,\nless dramatic events, many of them economic, conspired to bring about the fall.\nFallacy of Centralized Direction\n: Analysts many times assume the subjects\nthey are studying are pursuing coherent, rational, goal-maximizing policies. This\nis often not the case. In the 1980s, a domestic terrorist group called the\nCovenant, the Sword, and the Arm of the Lord made plans to bomb a church\nthat served openly gay parishioners. The \ndestruction of the church would not\nhave served the group\u2019s strategic ends; in fact, had they succeeded, they would\nhave been subjected to far greater scrutiny by law enforcement agencies. The\nreal reason for the planned attack was a power struggle within the group where\none member wanted to advance in rank and status by carrying out an act\ndeemed \u201cnoble\u201d by the group (K. Noble, personal communication to the author).\nFailure to Recognize Questionable Assumptions\n: Everyone makes\nassumptions; because they are so ingrained in our mindsets, we generally do not\nrecognize them. Assumptions in and of themselves are not bad\u2014we would be\nhard-pressed getting through the day without them. However, some are faulty\nand based on poor or incomplete reasoning. For example, in the 1980s many in\nlaw enforcement thought they knew what a drug courier looked like\u2014he was a\nyoung male, often a minority, driving a fancy, expensive car. Many unfortunate\nyoung men who fit this \u201cprofile\u201d found themselves under constant scrutiny.\nDrug organizations soon became wise to the \u201cprofile.\u201d One smart organization\n151\nbegan hiring elderly people to transport their contraband across the country in\nrecreational vehicles (RVs). They were successful for quite some time.\nFigure 5.2\n \nHole in the trunk of the D.C. sniper\u2019s car used to shoot victims. (Source: FBI)\nAnother example of this can be found in the D.C. sniper case of 2002 (\nFigure\n5.2\n). After one of the shootings, a witness noted a white van speeding away from\nthe scene. The police assumed this was the perpetrator making his escape and\nbegan concentrating only on white vans, excluding all other types of vehicles.\nAn equally valid, and ultimately correct, assumption would have been that,\nupon hearing shots, the driver of the van sped away because he did not want to\nbe a \nvictim himself. This assumption proved costly\u2014the real perpetrators, who\nwere driving a dark sedan, managed to escape scrutiny for several days despite\nthe fact that they came upon various roadblocks; in every case, they were waved\nright through. To overcome this particular bias, the IC uses a methodology\ncalled a Key Assumptions Check. This method will be described in \nChapter 6\n(\u201cAnalytic Methods\u201d).\n152\nGroup Decision-Making\nWho has not heard the old saying \u201ctwo heads are better than one?\u201d The supposed\nsuperiority of group decision-making is found in practically every aspect of our lives.\nConsider juries\u2014as a society, we are willing to put the fate of individuals in the hands of\ntheir peers, as long as there are 12 of them. As well, many important decisions are made\nby groups; students of history will no doubt remember the Cuban Missile Crisis, in\nwhich President Kennedy sat with his advisors in the \u201cwar room\u201d trying to decide what\nto do as the world faced a possible nuclear holocaust (\nFigure 5.3\n).\nFigure 5.3\n \nU.S. Navy reconnaissance plane flies over Soviet freighter during the Cuban Missile Crisis Attacks.\n(Source: Library of Congress Prints and Photographs Division Washington, D.C.)\nThe reality, however, is that group decision-making is not always better than that of\nindividuals; in some cases, it may actually be worse. Consider your own experience\nworking in groups. In a classroom seminar, do all \nstudents contribute equally? Of course\nnot\u2014usually, a small number or even an individual dominates the discussion. Others will\ncontribute on occasion and others not at all. However, the efficacy of group decision-\nmaking rests on the assumption that everyone\u2019s opinion has been heard and debated,\nallowing the best idea to bubble to the top. When that does not occur, it can convey a\nfalse sense of certitude.\nIn 1952, organizational analyst William H. Whyte invented the term \ngroupthink\n to\ndescribe conformity within groups. Social psychologist Irving Janis is most closely\nassociated with the concept, primarily because he performed many studies that\n153\nexamined how decisions are made in group settings. In 1972, Janis defined groupthink as:\nA mode of thinking that people engage in when they are deeply involved in a cohesive ingroup [sic], when the\nmembers\u2019 strivings for unanimity override their motivation to realistically appraise alternative courses of action.\n(Janis, 1972: 8\u20139)\nIn a nutshell, when a group gets together, especially in conditions of stress or where a\nquick deadline is imposed, there is often great pressure to come to a \u201cconsensus.\u201d Often\nin such a group, a leader or expert either exists or emerges. Once this leader expresses an\nopinion, others in the group may be reluctant to challenge it, either because they feel\ninsecure in their own position or are unwilling to confront the leader. In this way, the\nidea of a single individual is mistaken for the idea of the group. Others become even\nmore reluctant to say anything, believing (often incorrectly) that they are the only ones\nwho harbor doubts about the group\u2019s idea. In cohesive groups, members often know or\nthink they know how the group will respond in any given situation. To that end, when\nthey know their opinion is in opposition to the group position, they likewise keep their\nthoughts to themselves, in fear that they will alienate other members. In both cases, this\nis termed \nself-censorship\n, where members stifle opinions that run counter to what they\nbelieve to be the group\u2019s ideas.\nIn those cases where individuals are brave enough to voice unpopular ideas, others in\nthe group may attempt to put \npressure on dissenters\n to \u201cget in line\u201d with the other\nmembers. This can come in the form of attempting to reason with them, ridiculing their\nideas, or appealing to their sense of loyalty. In many cases, if the pressure becomes too\nintense, dissenters will surrender and withdraw their concerns. Others with similar\ndoubts who are not so brave will continue to self-censor.\nWhen contrary evidence is produced, it is often rationalized or explained away as\nbeing false or insignificant. This can easily lead to complacency, where group members\ncease any effort to consider ideas that run counter to what is believed to be the group\u2019s\nconsensus.\nWhat emerges is \napparent unanimity\n where superficially everyone is in agreement\nwhile in reality, lingering but unspoken doubts remain. Ironically, the more cohesive a\ngroup is, the more likely it is that groupthink will occur. This might seem strange\u2014after\nall, the closer folks are, the more candid they should be with one another. What Janis\nand others learned, however, is that oftentimes individuals are more interested in\npreserving group tranquility than they are in arriving at the best possible solution to a\nproblem.\nAs should be apparent, the IC is fertile ground for groupthink. Analysts are often\nforced to work under tight deadlines. Given the nature of the work, tight bonds often\nform and cohesive relationships are the norm. If anything, the potential for groupthink\nactually increases. Analysis was at one time a solitary pursuit; analysts often worked by\nthemselves or in small groups. However, that has changed considerably since the attacks\nof 9/11. Several commissions concluded that individuals needed to work together more\nclosely. Today, \u201ccollaboration\u201d is the name of the game. Of course, sharing information\n154\nand candid discussions are important for arriving at the best possible answer. However,\nanalysts must always be on guard to the dangers of groupthink. \nBox 5.4\n provides a\nclassic example of a situation where group decision-making broke down and led to\ntragedy.\nBox 5.4\n \nGroupthink: Bay of Pigs\nAn oft-cited example of groupthink in the IC, and one that Janis himself used, is the\nBay of Pigs fiasco in 1961. As far back as the Eisenhower administration, America\nwas uncomfortable having the Communist government of Cuba so close to its\nborders. As a result, the CIA began drawing up plans to support an invasion of the\nisland by Cuban exiles. The plan passed to John F. Kennedy when he became\nPresident.\nKennedy, who had won a very close election against Richard Nixon, was keen to\ndemonstrate his anti-Communist bona fides. His team of advisers was aware of this\nand when the time came to go ahead with the invasion, there were discussions\nabout its advisability. Many members of Kennedy\u2019s inner circle were quick to\naccept the most optimistic assumptions of the CIA and reject those that advised\ncaution. At first, a few advisers, such as Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Senator J.\nWilliam Fulbright, warned that the invasion was a bad idea. However, they were\nignored and their views marginalized. As a result, even they began to question their\nown doubts. At the end of the day, apparent unanimity emerged from a team of\nsmart, savvy individuals. Given their experience and skills, how could they be\nwrong? Of course they were, and the invasion turned into a fiasco that cast a pall\nover the young administration.\nSource:\n Janis, I. (1971).

However, readers must\nunderstand that there are politics with a capital \u201cP\u201d and politics with a small \u201cp.\u201d\nCapital-P politics corresponds to one\u2019s own political beliefs. Most analysts have no\nproblem understanding that their own political beliefs have no place in analysis.\nHowever, small-p politics is more insidious. It relates to the internal politics of an\norganization and the shaping of intelligence, either intentionally or unintentionally, to\nmeet the desires or preconceptions of the policymaker. Mark Lowenthal refers to this as\npoliticized intelligence\n. There are a number of reasons this can occur. The most obvious\nis that the analyst tells the boss what he wants to hear. This can occur when analysts\nplace their own career ambitions above the good of the organization and the country.\nHowever, the policymaker shares equal blame if they allow this to happen\u2014a savvy and\nethical boss creates a climate where objective analysis, rather than \u201cgood news,\u201d is the\ndesired outcome. This only makes sense\u2014a policymaker should want solid information\nto be able to confront the world as it is, not as they would like it to be. In truth, when\nintelligence is slanted, it puts the policymaker in a position of decision \ndis\n-advantage.\nOver the years, the IC has been accused on occasion of politicizing intelligence. For\nexample, critics charged that the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that reported that\nSaddam Hussein likely had WMDs was written to please the Bush administration, which\nhad designs on invading Iraq. However, numerous Congressional inquiries over the\nyears have failed to turn up any instances of intentional politicizing by the IC in the Iraq\nWMD analysis.\nNevertheless, policymakers with an agenda may attempt to sway intelligence in such\na way as to support their own interests. This can happen even in the way they ask\nquestions, forcing an analyst to reveal only that information that supports the\npolicymaker\u2019s opinion. A common piece of advice provided to lawyers is to \u201cnever ask a\nquestion to which you don\u2019t already know the answer.\u201d Clever leaders can use this same\ntactic to shape the discussion and gain advantage.\nEven when no nefarious intent is present, subtle forms of pressure may still be applied\nto analysts. Lowenthal notes that policymakers tend to be \u201coptimists.\u201d This should not be\nsurprising. Individuals with confidence in their own abilities and a can-do attitude are\ngenerally the ones to rise to the top in organizations. Analysts, on the other hand,\nespecially those who have been on the job for a long time and have seen policymakers\ncome and go, tend to be \u201cskeptics.\u201d They have developed an understanding of just how\ndifficult it can be to effect real change and are often wary of unconventional \npolicy.\nPolicymakers can grow frustrated with what they perceive as a \u201ccan\u2019t do\u201d attitude. This\nmay place analysts in an extremely awkward position. If they frustrate the boss too\n156\nmuch, they may lose access and influence. In this case, all the potential good they can do\nwill disappear. On the other hand, if they start to \u201cgo along\u201d with the policymaker\u2019s\nposition, they will lose credibility and objectivity. Despite the difficulty of the\ncircumstance, analysts should always call it the way they see it, avoiding P/politics and\nmaintaining the highest level of objectivity.\n157\nBureaucratic Barriers: Information Sharing\nThe 9/11 commission found that agencies\u2019 poor efforts at sharing information greatly\ninhibited analysis. This was not a new revelation\u2014as far back as the late 1940s various\ncritics bemoaned the fact that the FBI and CIA did not share information well.\nAlthough it may seem juvenile and puerile for grownups to refuse to share (and it\noften is), there are serious issues at stake for agencies. The first is security\u2014agencies\noften refuse to share information because they are afraid that others will not afford it the\nsame level of protection that they do. This could come about as the result of sloppiness\nand ineptitude, or in more sinister cases, through corruption. \nBox 4.1\n describes how\nBoston FBI Special Agent John Connolly protected gangster Whitey Bulger during\ninvestigations by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Massachusetts\nState Police; for a long time, these agencies had difficulty working with and trusting the\nFBI in Boston. This shows how a \u201cbad apple\u201d can spoil relations between agencies.\nAlthough agencies sometimes withhold information due to mistrust, that is usually\nnot their main concern. Everyone in the IC who handles classified or sensitive\ninformation must undergo an extensive background check and receive a clearance. This\noften requires agency staff to conduct interviews with references and colleagues, credit\nand criminal checks, drug screenings, and polygraph examinations. The arrest of spies\nsuch as Robert Hans-sen and Aldrich Ames shows that the system is far from perfect.\nHowever, most in the IC can be trusted to keep information to themselves. Sir Francis\nBacon is credited with the oft-quoted observation that \u201cknowledge is power\u201d; nowhere is\nthat more true than in the intelligence arena. Knowledge is the product of the IC, much\nas cars are the product of the automotive industry. As a result, there is a strong incentive\nfor agencies and individuals to \u201cprotect their turf\u201d by hoarding valuable information.\nThis may seem self-defeating, \nespecially when the security of the United States is at\nstake; however, in reality, governmental organizations compete for valuable resources.\nThose that can demonstrate their competence and value align themselves to receive a\nbigger piece of the fiscal pie.\nConsider the FBI; founded in 1908 as the Bureau of Investigation (BOI), it was one of\nmany federal agencies that had law enforcement powers. In its infancy, it was small and\ndid not enjoy a particularly savory reputation. In 1924, President Calvin Coolidge\nappointed J. Edgar Hoover, a young Washington, D.C. attorney, as its sixth director.\nHoover would transform this agency into the FBI and serve as its director until his death\nin 1972. Ultimately a controversial figure, Hoover was an entrepreneurial dynamo. In\nshort order, he revamped the organization from a bureaucratic backwater into a cutting\nedge agency that focused on the \u201cscientific\u201d investigation of crimes. A public relations\ngenius, he created the image of the square-jawed \u201cG-man,\u201d a well-educated,\nincorruptible, and tireless public servant. Quick to recognize opportunity, Hoover took\n158\nover the national fingerprint database, which had previously been administered by the\nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, and set up a crime laboratory and a\nrepository for crime statistics. His big break came during the \u201cGangster Era\u201d when the\nBOI and later the FBI made national headlines capturing or killing such notorious figures\nas John Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Ma Barker and her gang. Public acclaim helped\npersuade Congress to provide ever-increasing funding to the Bureau.\nIn addition to the pursuit of resources, some individuals in the IC allow their egos and\nsense of competition to get in the way of sharing. It is natural for one to assume that his\nor her organization is the best, and competition can be good if it motivates people to\ncontinually strive for excellence. However, when it crosses the line into animus against\nother agencies or competitiveness that prevents valuable information from being shared,\nit becomes dangerous. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to hear members of the IC\n\u201cbashing\u201d other agencies with which they are in competition, all the while offering\neffusive praise for their own organization.\nEven when agencies want to share information, it may not always be possible. For\nexample, each organization has its own computer system. Many times, these systems\ncannot \u201ctalk\u201d to one another; they exist as \nstovepipes\n, which translates as systems that\nare isolated from one another. Stovepipes can be technology or policy driven. They can\nexist both between and within agencies. For example, in the FBI, for years agents who\nworked national security matters were not permitted to discuss their cases with agents\nwho were assigned to national security investigations unless certain conditions existed.\nThis policy, termed \nthe wall\n, was driven by the desire to preserve civil rights; \nhowever,\nit prevented valuable information from being shared. Absence of information drives\nincomplete analysis.\nCultural differences also separate agencies. Spies talk one language; law enforcers talk\nanother. The CIA and the DEA may both be assigned the mission of dismantling foreign\ndrug cartels. However, the DEA\u2019s approach would likely consist of building criminal\ncases through gathering evidence in legally prescribed ways. The CIA, on the other\nhand, would gather information, however obtained, to gain insight into the inner\nworkings of the organization to allow policy makers a wide range of options. If they\nwere assigned to work together, you can see how each side could grow frustrated with\nthe other\u2014the CIA may chafe at the restrictions inherent in law enforcement, whereas\nthe DEA would be alarmed at the potential for tainted evidence. In their own worlds,\neach group would be right.\n159\nFigure 5.4\n \nFBI Special Agents and Intelligence Analysts link information together in hopes of preventing a\nterrorist attack. (Source: FBI)\nIn the days following the 9/11 attacks, a phrase that gained considerable attention was\nthe failure of the IC to \nconnect-the-dots\n (\nFigure 5.4\n). In the children\u2019s exercise of the\nsame name, individuals draw lines between dots in a particular order; once they have\ndone so, a complete picture emerges. Connecting-the-dots became a metaphor for a\ncomplete and transparent sharing of information that would allow analysts across the IC\nto divine \nthe \u201cbig picture.\u201d In an ideal scenario, the CIA might have a human source that\nreported on a suspected al Qa\u2019ida training camp in North Africa. The National\nGeospatial-Intelligence Agency would provide satellite imagery of the camp, whereas\nthe NSA could contribute signals intelligence gleaned from telephonic conversations\nbetween principles at the camp. Perhaps the DIA would also have information about the\nactivities being carried out in the area. In this example, all source intelligence would\nallow for a complete picture to emerge\u2014no one agency would have access to all the\ninformation but, by working together and leveraging the particular strengths of each\norganization, the \u201cdots could be connected.\u201d As we discussed in \nChapter 1\n (\u201cAn\nOverview of Intelligence\u201d), not every observer of the IC likes the imagery inherent in\nthis metaphor. Some think it oversimplifies the process and provides unrealistic\nexpectations. In some cases, it is simply impossible for all the dots to be connected;\nuncertainty and ambiguity will always remain a part of the intelligence enterprise and\nassembling only part of the puzzle may be the best we can do in some circumstances.\nRegardless of the cause, lack of information sharing was cited as a major cause of the\nfailure to prevent the 9/11 attacks. In its findings, the 9/11 Commission (2004) noted that:\nThe CIA and the FBI did not adequately share information about known al\nQa\u2019ida operatives and operations.\n160\nThe FBI incorrectly perceived legal barriers to sharing information within the\nagency (the \u201cwall\u201d).\nThe IC lacked the capacity to adequately share information between partners.\nOne of the reasons the position of Director of National Intelligence (DNI) was\nestablished in 2004 was to promote and oversee the sharing of information between IC\nagencies. Soon after its creation, the DNI came out with a \n100 Day Plan\n. Chief among its\npriorities was establishing a \nCulture of Collaboration\n in which agencies are to work\nclosely together for the common good. Ridding the community of stovepipes to the\ngreatest extent possible became an overriding goal for the DNI.\n161\nSecurity and Sharing: Inherent Tension\nReaders will be introduced to the concept of \u201cneed to know\u201d in \nChapter 8\n(\u201cCounterintelligence\u201d). Basically, it is one of the preconditions under which classified\ninformation can be shared: individuals who receive the information require it to perform\ntheir duties. This sets up an affirmative duty on the part of the receiver of information to\ndemonstrate that they require access. It also demonstrates a dilemma that has existed\nsince the earliest days of intelligence: how can one share information with those who\nneed it and yet protect it from adversaries? It is axiomatic that intelligence that does not\nget to the right person is useless; intelligence that gets to the wrong person can prove\ndeadly. As the circle of who is allowed access expands, so does the likelihood that\nsomeone in that circle will either inadvertently or intentionally reveal sensitive data.\nNevertheless, in the DNI\u2019s own words:\nThe Intelligence Community\u2019s \u201cneed-to-know\u201d culture, a necessity during the Cold War, is now a handicap that\nthreatens our ability to uncover, respond, and protect against terrorism and other asymmetric threats. (Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence, 2008: 3)\nThe history of security and sharing in the IC is like a pendulum\u2014depending on the\nperceived need, it swings back and forth between extremes. When an agency is stung by\nthe revelation of a mole, it usually attempts to enhance security, which in turn means\nlimiting access to sensitive info. For example, after turncoat Robert Hanssen was arrested\nin 2001, the FBI completely revamped its security procedures, restricting information\nflow and requiring regular polygraphs for individuals who had access to particularly\nsensitive information. Indeed, at the precise moment that the planes were slamming into\nthe World Trade Center on 9/11, one of your authors was in an auditorium at the FBI\nAcademy in Quantico, Virginia, hearing about new FBI policies that included restrictions\non information sharing (ironically, lack of sharing would be blamed for the failure to\nprevent the attacks).\nEven when security does not totally restrict access to information, it can inhibit the\nease at which it is shared. In some agencies, individuals are assigned two computers\u2014\none is open to the internet, whereas the other is hardwired for intra-agency\ncommunications only. In some extreme cases, the computers may be located in two\nseparate locations. Although this does not cut offsharing, it can slow things down\nconsiderably.\nSome security policies have historically made it very difficult to obtain the necessary\ntalent to perform IC missions successfully. In the days following the 9/11 attacks, many\nagencies were woefully short staffed with individuals who spoke critical languages, such\nas Arabic, Pashto, Urdu, and Farsi. Because security clearances require the bearer to be a\nU.S. citizen, it was extremely difficult to staff those positions. Native speakers, at least\nsome of whom would have otherwise been able to pass the background investigation,\n162\nwere precluded from even applying if they were not citizens. Additionally, \nindividuals\nwho have spent many years in a foreign country\u2014exactly the type of experience that\nwould be of great benefit to the IC\u2014often find it difficult to obtain a clearance if they\nhave made long-lasting friendships with people in these countries.\nFrom a security standpoint, these requirements make sense. After all, foreign powers\nhave been known to place sleeper agents in the United States (see \nBox 5.5\n), and\nindividuals with close ties to other countries may be susceptible to approaches by foreign\nintelligence services. Nevertheless, as the earlier quote from the DNI made clear, the IC\nrealizes that, in today\u2019s networked world, it needs to do a better job of sharing\ninformation and intelligence. To that end, it has come up with a concept termed\nresponsibility to provide\n. In 2008, then-DNI John McConnell put it this way:\nBox 5.5\n \nOperation Ghost Stories\nSleeper agents, also known as \u201cdeep cover\u201d operatives, are individuals who have been placed in a target\ncountry to \u201csleep,\u201d or remain inactive, until they are \u201cawakened\u201d by their home government; in many cases,\nthis may not happen for years. Sleeper agents often take on new identities and attempt to blend in to their\nsurroundings to the greatest extent possible.\nAlthough many associate sleeper cells with the Soviet Union and the Cold War, these activities continue\nunabated to this day. In 2010, the FBI arrested 10 Russian sleeper agents in a case dubbed Operation Ghost\nStories. These individuals had been placed in the United States by the SVR, the Russian Foreign Intelligence\nService. Although none had obtained classified information, the FBI maintained that they had been inserted\nto someday develop sources of information in U.S. policymaking circles. The 10 were remarkable for being\nunremarkable; they led seemingly normal lives. Some married, bought homes, and maintained a family\u2014all\nthe while in the employ of the SVR. Despite the fact that they were nondescript, they were still caught. In\nan ending tailor made for a Cold War novel, they were flown to Vienna on July 9, 2010 and exchanged in a\n\u201cspy swap\u201d for four Russian nationals who had been caught assisting the United States.\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2011).

Improving information sharing will bring about true all-source analysis and deliver timely,\nobjective, and actionable intelligence to our senior decision-makers, war fighters, and defenders of the\nhomeland. This strategy\u2014by detailing information sharing, \nstrategic keystones, goals, and objectives\u2014provides\nvital direction to our efforts to effect these changes. Together, we must challenge the status quo of a \u201cneed-to-\nknow\u201d culture and move to one of a \u201cresponsibility to provide\u201d mindset. (Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence, 2008: 2)\nAlthough these words inspire confidence, we should not underestimate the challenge\u2014\nthere is no easy solution to the security-sharing dilemma. If history is any indication, the\nIC will continue to wrestle with this issue for years to come.\n163\nConclusion\nGiven the many potential barriers to good analysis, it may seem amazing that the IC gets\nthings right as often as it does. As should be clear at this point, good analysis does not\njust \u201chappen.\u201d It requires an extraordinary effort on the part of analysts, supported by\nthe good work of collectors and leadership on the part of policymakers.

In this chapter, we\nwill discuss several techniques for improving both the process of analysis and the final\nproduct that is provided to policymakers.\nFrom the earliest days of the intelligence community (IC), there was little structure to\nanalysis. The prevailing wisdom was to hire bright people with an expertise in a\nparticular area and allow them to conduct research as they saw fit. Although each\nagency had a particular format for reporting that analysts had to follow, much less\nemphasis was placed on the manner in which they reached conclusions. Since many\nanalysts had an academic background, they often brought with them the methodologies\nof their respective disciplines (e.g., psychology, political science).\nHowever, experience suggested that many analytical conclusions were flat out wrong\n(see \nBox 5.1\n). As the quote by Richards Heuer at the beginning of this chapter suggests,\nflawed conclusions were often driven, not so much by gaps in collection, but by failures\nof analysis.\nBefore we begin to describe what makes analysis \u201cgood,\u201d it is advisable to understand\njust what the term \u201canalysis\u201d means in the IC. Rob Johnston, writing for the Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA), defined it as follows (Johnston, 2005):\nIntelligence analysis is the application of individual and collective cognitive methods to weigh data and test\nhypotheses within a secret socio-cultural context.\nThis definition, and others like it, frames analysis as both a process and a product. The\nproduct is the final report, whereas the process is what the analyst did to come to his\nconclusions. At its core, the analytical process consists of looking at information\u2014\nsometimes voluminous amounts of information\u2014 from myriad sources and coming to\nconclusions that will assist policymakers in performing their jobs. As discussed in\nprevious chapters, there is a general consensus that all-source intelligence (i.e., from\nnumerous types of collection platforms) is best. As well, most would agree that analysis\nshould be both nonpolitical and objective\u2014one\u2019s biases should not affect the final\nproduct. \nAs \nChapter 5\n (\u201cBarriers to Analysis\u201d) made clear, however, shedding one\u2019s\nbiases is a difficult process.\nMost policymakers have their own definition of what constitutes \u201cgood analysis.\u201d\nAlthough everyone may answer the question somewhat differently, most would\nprobably agree in principle with Gudmund Thompson of Canada\u2019s National Defense\nHeadquarters, who says that for analysts to exhibit analytical rigor, they should (G.\nThompson, personal communication to authors):\nMake accurate judgments\n168\nBe clear\nBe insightful, timely, and relevant\nHighlight trends over time (be consistent)\nToday, the intelligence community is making a concerted effort to improve its analytical\ntradecraft. To that end, there is great emphasis placed in three key areas: \ncritical\nthinking, collaboration\n, and the use of \nstructured analytical techniques\n.\n169\nCritical Thinking\nIf you ask intelligence managers what they want in an entry-level analyst, they will\ninvariably reply \u201csomeone with good critical thinking skills.\u201d Although there is universal\nagreement on the need for such attributes, there is far less agreement on just what\n\u201ccritical thinking\u201d actually means. To be sure, it has something to do with thinking\ndeeply rather than superficially about a subject. As well, it also entails thinking broadly,\nor \u201coutside the box.\u201d Indeed, the 9/11 Commission reported that the greatest failure by\nthe intelligence community in predicting the attacks was a \u201cfailure of imagination\u201d (9/11\nCommission, 2004).\nThe Foundation for Critical Thinking provides this definition:\nCritical thinking is that mode of thinking\u2014about any subject, content, or problem\u2014in which the thinker\nimproves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully analyzing, assessing, and reconstructing it. Critical\nthinking is self-directed, self-disciplined, self-monitored, and self-corrective thinking. (Foundation for Critical\nThinking, n.d.)\nFrom this definition, it is clear that critical thinking cannot be developed overnight. It is\na long process that requires a good deal of effort on the part of the would-be analyst.\nCritical thinking has long been seen as the province of philosophers, who teach subjects\nsuch as epistemology\u2014the study \nof knowledge\u2014and semiotics\u2014the study of how people\ncommunicate. An increasing number of intelligence studies courses offered at\nuniversities today are being taught by philosophers; this is aimed squarely at developing\ncritical thinking skills in students who hope to enter the intelligence world. Universities\nare appropriate places to teach these skills; intelligence organizations are limited in the\namount of time they have to train individuals, and learning to think critically requires a\ngood deal of time. As well, the older a person gets, the more difficult it is to \u201cunlearn\u201d\nbad habits.\nIn line with best analytical practices, the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s Directorate of\nAnalysis has established the following \u201cSelect Intellectual Standards,\u201d which it expects\neach of its analysts to follow (Defense Intelligence Agency, n.d.):\nClarity\n of assessment, argument\nRelevance\n of the data to the subject matter\nDepth:\n account for the complexity of the subject matter\u2014do not oversimplify!\nBreadth:\n consider various perspectives surrounding the subject matter\nPrecision:\n use specifics to support your argument\u2014be exact!\n170\nCollaboration\nAnalysis is often seen as a solitary activity with a lone analyst toiling away in a cubicle,\nstudying a small part of the world and producing endless monographs. Good social skills\nand outgoing personalities are generally ascribed to the collectors and field agents who\nmust use persuasion to recruit sources rather than analysts. This stereotype is so\npervasive that is has spawned a joke that is heard in all corners of the intelligence world:\nQ:\n How do you recognize an extroverted analyst?\nA:\n He\u2019s the one who stares at your shoes.\nLike most stereotypes, this characterization is overly broad and often not true. However,\nit is true that collaboration among analysts has not been a high priority in the IC until\nrecently. This paradigm is changing. As discussed in previous chapters, recent\nintelligence miscues such as the inability to predict the 9/11 attacks and the flawed\nanalysis of Iraq\u2019s possession of weapons of mass destruction demonstrated that agencies\ndid not share information properly. Thus, the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence committed itself to developing a \u201cresponsibility to provide\u201d culture rather\nthan one based solely on \u201cneed to know.\u201d Today, when a National Intelligence Estimate\nis produced, the writing team often consists of analysts from different agencies who\nlikely bring different perspectives and views of the world.\nAs well, innovations such as the internet and social networking now allow individuals\nfrom throughout the world to communicate. In 2005, the Director of National\nIntelligence (DNI) introduced \nIntellipedia\n, a classified, collaborative tool based on\ninternet and wiki technology. Quickly embraced, especially among younger analysts,\nIntellipedia allows for across-the-board collaboration among analysts from a multitude\nof organizations. One of the benefits of this approach is that it allows for rapid sharing of\ninformation and ideas between many experts; at a 2007 conference, Dr. Thomas Fingar,\nDeputy Director of National Intelligence for Analysis, described how Intellipedia had\nbeen used to successfully analyze the use of chlorine gas by insurgents in Iraq in a very\nshort period (Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 2007):\nAfter the chlorine-filled IEDs were used for the first time in Iraq, somebody said, we need a collection\nrequirement for information on [the] use of chlorine in IEDs. And over a period of about three days, if my\nmemory is right, 23 people\u2014some collectors, some analysts scattered around the world\u2014put together, using\nIntellipedia, a perfectly respectable collection directive\u2014what was needed. And it just happened. Nobody said\nuse this tool.\nAlthough the need for collaboration has been made explicit recently, informal\ncollaboration has existed for some time between analysts. In a recent ethnographic study\nof the CIA, one observer noted:\n171\nDespite the seemingly private and psychological nature of analysis as defined in the literature, what I found was\na great deal of informal, yet purposeful collaboration during which individuals began to make sense of raw data\nby negotiating meaning among the historical record, their peers, and their supervisors. (Johnston, 2005)\n172\nStructured Analytical Techniques\nSome experts have concluded that unstructured analysis, such as that performed in the\nearly days of the IC, does little to inhibit the production of bias.\n1\n Consequently, a good\ndeal of effort has been devoted to establishing \nstructured analytical techniques\n, or\norganized, explicit methods for analyzing information. In chemistry, a laboratory\nexperiment with all its rules and requirements is considered a structured analytical\ntechnique. Of course, experiments have been around for a long time and are recognized\nby scientists as providing valid results that allow for drawing meaningful conclusions;\nthe methods being developed in the IC today are too new to assess at this point, although\nmany intelligence officials believe they do improve analysis.\nThe following sections describe some of the more popular structured techniques in use\ntoday. Analysts have their own criteria for deciding which ones to use. Some are\ndesigned for particular phases of an analysis, such as the beginning, whereas others are\nappropriate for particular types of questions. As with trying to use many sources of\ninformation, analysts are encouraged to use many different analytical techniques.\nPerhaps the most important thing to come from using these methods is that it forces\nanalysts to \u201cthink about their thinking.\u201d In other words, it makes them more conscious of\ntheir biases and assumptions, which can then be eliminated.\nUnderstanding Our Assumptions: Key Assumptions Check\nIn every decision we make, we formulate assumptions; in most cases, our assumptions\nremain unstated. This can be dangerous, especially if we assume incorrectly. As\ndiscussed in the previous chapter, this can lead to mirror imaging, or filtering\ninformation through the lens of personal experience. When we mirror image, we assume\nthat others view the world the same way that we do. For example, in 1993, the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) was involved in a standoff against a religious group known\nas the Branch Davidians near Waco, Texas. The standoff began when federal agents with\nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (BATFE) attempted to serve a\nsearch warrant, looking for illegal weapons. Upon their arrival at the Davidian fortress, a\nfirefight broke out in which four BATFE agents and five Branch Davidians were killed.\nAfter 51 days, FBI managers on-scene decided to inject tear gas into the Davidian\ncompound, reasoning that mothers would not allow their children to suffer through the\npainful gas. However, that is exactly what happened; to make matters worse, the\nDavidians lit their own buildings on fire, preferring to die in the flames rather than\nsurrender to \u201cBabylon\u201d (\nFigure 6.1\n) Later evidence showed that some of the mothers\nallowed their children to be shot at close range rather than die in the fire. It later\n173\nemerged that the FBI managers viewed the Davidian leader, David Koresh, as a \u201ccon\nman.\u201d Given their law enforcement experience and Koresh\u2019s behavior, this was not an\nunreasonable conclusion. However, they under estimated the level of commitment of\nKoresh\u2019s followers, who believed him to be the Messiah. When Koresh told them that\nthey would ascend straight to heaven if they endured the tear gas assault and died in the\nfire which he had prophesized, it made complete sense that they would do so; the FBI\nleaders assumed that the Davidians would behave as any \u201cnormal\u201d parent, never\nallowing their children to suffer and die in such a way.\nFigure 6.1\n Branch Davidian compound burns to the ground in Waco, Texas. (Source: FBI)\nHad Bureau personnel engaged in a key assumption check, they might have realized\nthat they and the Davidians saw the world in very different ways. By making\nassumptions explicit, they could have better understood the potential ramifications of\ntheir actions.\nA key assumptions check is nothing more than articulating and reviewing key\nassumptions throughout the analytical process. It is generally a good idea to start these\nchecks at the beginning of an analysis, since everyone brings preconceptions and\nassumptions to the table. This process may be especially valuable for groups and\nindividuals who have worked with one another for a long time, for they often\nunconsciously share the same biases and assumptions.\nAlthough the key assumptions check methodology may appear deceptively simple, it\nmay, in fact, be one of the most difficult methods to do well; after all, many of our\nbeliefs about the world are deeply embedded and may be difficult to recognize.\nIn the U.S. Government publication titled \nA TradecraftPrimer: Structured Analytic\nTechniques for Improving Intelligence Analysis\n, the anonymous authors provide a key\nassumptions check for a series of sniper attacks that engulfed the Washington, D.C. area\nfor three weeks in 2002. Law enforcement officials made many assumptions throughout\nthe case, many of which proved to be false (see \nTable 6.1\n). Had authorities better\n174\nidentified their assumptions, they may have (1) avoided jumping to conclusions; (2) been\nmore receptive to eyewitness tips that went against their assumptions; and (3) not\ndisregarded important evidence.\nTable 6.1\n Key Assumption Check for DC Sniper Case\nKey Assumption\nAssessment\nThe sniper is a male.\nHighly likely (but not certain) given past precedent with serial\nkillers.\nThe sniper is white.\nLikely, but not as certain, given past precedents.

In \nPsychology of Intelligence Analysis\n, Richards Heuer identified the\ninability of analysts to properly consider a wide range of possible hypotheses rather than\nmerely their favorite as one of the IC\u2019s biggest problems (Heuer, 1999). This realization\nwould come back to haunt the IC after the 9/11 attacks when the commission formed to\ninvestigate them concluded that the biggest failure was a lack of imagination. To remedy\nthis, Heuer suggested that analysts should force themselves to consider a variety of\ndifferent hypotheses; hence, ACH was born.\nIt is important to understand just what is meant by the term \u201chypothesis.\u201d A\nhypothesis is basically a statement or conclusion. Importantly, it \nis a statement that can\nbe \u201cfalsified,\u201d or disproven. Hypotheses should also be specific as opposed to overly\nbroad, simple as opposed to unnecessarily complex, and \u201cfruitful\u201d or capable of\nanswering some meaningful question. Heuer notes that analysts should test hypotheses\nin the same way that doctors do to formulate diagnoses (see \nBox 6.1\n).\n175\nHypotheses should flow from questions that policymakers want answered; however,\nthe questions that are passed to analysts often need to be refined. Indeed, framing the\nright questions can be the most difficult task that an analyst faces. After all, if the right\nquestions are not asked, it does not matter how elegant or well thought out the\nsucceeding analysis might be; it will be of little use to anyone. As discussed in \nChapter 4\n(\u201cCollection\u201d), the question, \u201cWill Mexico be a threat to the United States in the next five\nyears?\u201d cannot be answered in a meaningful way because the writer does not specify\nwhat he or she means by \u201cthreat.\u201d Are we to assume the threat concerns drug violence\nspilling over into the United States, an economic issue, illegal immigration, or something\nelse entirely?\nUsually, the first task of an analyst is refining the questions that should be answered.\nThis can be a delicate process\u2014very often, analysts who have studied a situation or\ncountry for years may be far more knowledgeable than policymakers, who may have\nlittle experience in the area. Analysts, in fact, will often know better than policymakers\nthe questions that should be asked. However, the policymaker is the customer and may\nbecome irritated or insulted if analysts are too forceful in their assertions or do not\nprovide what is asked. An old axiom in the intelligence world holds that \u201cwhen the boss\nasks for apples, don\u2019t bring oranges.\u201d Despite this, analysts need to have the moral\ncourage to both tell the truth, even when it is painful, and bring important issues to light.\nBox 6.1\n \nHeuer\u2019s Medical Model for Hypothesis Testing\nA more accurate analogy for describing how intelligence analysis should work is\nmedical diagnosis. The doctor observes indicators (symptoms) of what is happening,\nuses his or her specialized knowledge of how the body works to develop hypotheses\nthat might explain these observations, conducts tests to collect additional\ninformation to evaluate the hypotheses, then makes a diagnosis. This medical\nanalogy focuses attention on the ability to identify and evaluate all plausible\nhypotheses. Collection is focused narrowly on information that will help to\ndiscriminate the relative probability of alternate hypothesis.\nSource:\n Heuer, R. (1999). Psychology of intelligence analysis. McLean, VA: Central\nIntelligence Agency, 62.\nTable 6.2\n Analysis of Competing Hypotheses Matrix\n176\nOnce analysts frame the proper questions they should generate hypotheses. As the\nname implies, the hypotheses should compete with one another. A good way to begin\nthe process is to have a group of analysts brainstorm different and distinct hypotheses\nthat cover the subject; they should consider many possibilities. Once they develop\nhypotheses, analysts should place them in a matrix similar to the one shown in \nTable 6.2\n.\nFacts and evidence pertaining to the question under study are gathered and placed in\nthe matrix. Each fact is then assessed for \ncredibility\n (\u201cC\u201d), or how likely it is that the\ninformation is correct, and \nimpact\n (I), or, if true, to what degree does the information\nimpact the correctness/incorrectness of each hypothesis? Both credibility and impact can\nbe measured in any number of ways. Unless one has great certainty, it probably makes\nsense to express things qualitatively (high/medium/low) rather than quantitatively; one\ndoes not want to give a false sense of precision where it is not warranted.\nNext, the analyst weighs each fact against whether it supports, refutes, or has no effect\non each hypothesis. Again, there are any number of ways to express consistency. Some\nanalysts use numbers, whereas others approach things qualitatively. Readers are\ncertainly familiar with Likert scales, even if that term sounds foreign. Each of us has\nanswered a survey where we had to state that we \u201cstrongly support\u201d or \u201cdo not support\u201d\nsomething. Similar scales can be constructed for the ACH matrix. For example:\nStrongly supports:\n++\nSupports:\n+\nNo effect:\n\u00d7\nRefutes:\n\u2013\nStrongly refutes:\n\u2013 \u2013\nA few things need to be considered when \u201ctesting\u201d hypotheses in this manner. Unlike\nlaboratory experiments where things can be controlled, analysts \nperform their duties in a\nworld of uncertainty and ambiguity; there are a lot of unknowns that exist that may\nmake testing quite difficult. Compounding this problem, adversaries will attempt to\nintroduce denial and deception into the equation; this is why judging the credibility of\nsources is so important. As discussed in \nChapter 4\n (\u201cCollection\u201d), in its analysis of Iraq\u2019s\n177\nweapons of mass destruction program in the days leading up to the Gulf War of 2003,\nAmerica placed a great deal of stock in a human intelligence source code-named\n\u201cCurveball,\u201d who proved to be disastrously wrong.\nAnalysts also need to realize that, like scientists, their goal is to disprove, not prove,\nhypotheses. The ones that remain \u201cstanding\u201d at the end of the process are the ones that\nshould be judged most likely.\nOnce the analyst has filled in the matrix, it is their job to determine which hypotheses\nhave been refuted and which, if any, have been supported. This is more complex than\nmerely adding up numbers or counting pluses and minuses. A single piece of evidence\nmay be so impactful and credible that it may outweigh several pieces that appear to\nrefute it. In addition, some evidence may be judged to shed little light on the situation,\nperiod. This could result from it having low impact and credibility or because it does not\noffer any insight into falsification. Evidence of this nature is deemed to have little\n\u201cdiagnostic value.\u201d\nAs analysts complete the process, they may find that some hypotheses have been\nfalsified, some have been strongly supported, some have been weakly supported, etc.\nThey may decide that entirely new hypotheses are needed and that the process must be\nrepeated. Alternatively, they may decide that they are confident enough to make\ntentative conclusions. If the latter is the case, analysts should report on the likelihood of\neach\n hypothesis using estimative language further discussed in \nChapter 11\n (\u201cWriting and\nBriefing for the Intelligence Community\u201d). Analysts also need to consider how sensitive\ntheir ACH results are to a few critical items of evidence. If that evidence proves wrong,\nwill that make the conclusions incorrect?\nTable 6.3\n provides an example of a hypothetical ACH involving a rape/murder suspect\nwho broke into a victim\u2019s apartment. In particular, detectives wanted to see what the\navailable information said about the perpetrator\u2019s likely residence. Some of the facts of\nthe case included: bloody barefoot print leftat the scene; perpetrator made no attempt to\nwash up; perpetrator was seemingly aware of the location of single females in the\napartment complex; a source of questionable reliability said the attack was very similar\nto one that had occurred out of state in the past month.\nIn \nTable 6.3\n, because they were discovered by detectives, facts 1 and 2 had a great deal\nof credibility (high); fact 3 was somewhat speculative but based on sound reasoning\n(medium); fact 4 was from a questionable source (low). \nThe bloody footprint was judged\nto have some diagnostic value, because if the offender was barefoot, he likely lived close\nby. However, the police could not tell if he was barefoot through the entire episode or\nremoved his shoes to commit the rape. Facts 2 and 3 were judged to be highly impactful\nand the human source information, if correct, either pointed to a serial rapist or was\nmerely coincidental. The police judged facts 2 and 3 to be strongly suggestive of a rapist\nwho lived nearby; knowing the location of females and not bothering to wash up from a\nbloody murder scene indicated someone who was familiar and comfortable with the area\nand did not have far to travel.\n178\nTable 6.3\n ACH Example\nAt the end of their analysis, the police judged hypothesis 1 to be the most likely but\ncould not rule out hypothesis 2, especially if the perpetrator had contacts in the victim\u2019s\ncomplex. They felt that hypothesis 3 was the least likely but held out the possibility that,\nwith additional pieces of critical information, such as corroborating the human source\u2019s\nstory, it might increase in likelihood.\nPreparing for Whatever Comes: Scenarios\nIn some situations, it may be better to prepare for a host of possible futures rather than\ntry to forecast the most likely. In the 1970s, the oil giant Royal Dutch Shell employed a\nstrategic planning department to foresee possible future events that could affect the\ncompany. One of the methods the planners at Shell used was \nscenario planning\n, where\nteam members envisioned any number of different possibilities, regardless of how\nimplausible they seemed. As a result, Shell was able to anticipate many improbable\nevents, such as the OPEC oil embargo of 1973, and prepare itself appropriately. Scenarios\nare very good for considering alternative futures; they are also easy to construct. At their\nmost basic, they can be exercises in \u201cwhat ifs.\u201d For example, what if a report comes in\nthat al Qa\u2019ida members are learning to fly jumbo jets? What could that mean?\nScenarios are well used by emergency planners and military personnel, who\nconstantly ask themselves \u201cwhat if a category three hurricane were to \nstrike\u201d or \u201cwhat if\nthe house we\u2019re to search is full of insurgents?\u201d They can also be used more strategically,\nto consider the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d of future events.\nAlthough there are many different ways that scenarios can be constructed, author Joel\nGarreau has detailed one that is both useful and simple (see Garreau, 2001). As with any\nmethodology, the first step is to identify the central issue or question to be studied, and\nto include a reasonable time frame. Once this occurs, the analyst or team constructs a list\nof \ndriving forces\n, or trends that will likely affect the issue under study. Driving forces\ncan be political (the Tea Party movement), cultural (the growth of Falun Gong),\neconomic (China\u2019s state-run capitalism), technological (artificial neural networks), or\n179\nalmost any trend that will have an effect. Once the list has been established, the two\nmain driving forces, as determined by the analysts, are identified.\nAt that point, the analyst constructs an \nx\u2013y\n matrix (see \nFigure 6.2\n).\nAnalysts assign one driving force to the \nx\n axis and the other one to the \ny\n axis; they\nthen plot the extremes of each case in both the positive and negative directions. For\nexample, if one of the driving forces is the global recession that gripped the planet in\n2008, one side of the axis would forecast that the recession would worsen in the time\nframe under study; the other end of the axis would forecast that it would disappear, and\neconomic conditions would improve.\nThe analysts then consider each quadrant and describe how the issue would likely be\naffected based on the interaction of the two driving forces. In essence, analysts tell four\ndifferent \u201cstories\u201d about four different possible future worlds. Some analysts, especially\nthose who are used to performing tactical analysis, may be discomforted by the prospect\nof \u201ctelling stories.\u201d However, this is not a trivial process; the IC has long recognized the\nvalue of this technique and regularly includes scenarios in its long-term strategic\nprojects.\nFigure 6.2\n \nThe type of matrix used to conduct scenario analysis\nThe final step is to identify \nmilestones\n, or events along the way, to help analysts\ndetermine which scenario is likely \u201ccoming true.\u201d In the case of trying to determine if the\neconomy is improving, the unemployment rate would be a good milestone.\nIn the following hypothetical scenario, an analyst was tasked with determining the\nlikelihood that Iran would increase its efforts to develop nuclear weapons. He was\nfurther tasked with using Israel\u2019s relationship with Hezbollah and the price of oil as\n180\ndriving forces. The analyst constructed the following matrix (\nFigure 6.3\n):\nUpon the Conclusion of the Analysis, the Analyst Constructed the Following Scenarios\nQuadrant A\n (High oil prices, poor relations): This represented the most dangerous scenario; thanks to the\nbooming price of oil, Iran had the finances to develop nuclear weapons. As well, because relations between Israel\nand Hezbollah had worsened, it also had the motivation. Iran was willing to risk additional sanctions and the\nenmity of the rest of the world to achieve nuclear parity with Israel and to protect its surrogate.\nMilestones: Increasing skirmishes between Israel and Hezbollah; oil shortages; restrictions on offshore drilling\nas a result of oil spills\nQuadrant B\n (High oil prices, relations improve): This is still a dangerous scenario. Although Iran is pleased\nthat stability exists between Israel and Hezbollah, it has other reasons for developing nuclear weapons besides\nprotecting its partner. Although the motivation remains to develop nukes, the need seems not so pressing. Iran\nmay be more willing to listen to the international community.\nFigure 6.3\n \nAn example of scenario analysis to forecast the likelihood that Iran will increase its efforts to\ndevelop nuclear weapons; the analyst used Israel\u2019s relationship with Hezbollah and the price of oil as\ndriving forces\nMilestones: Talks between Israel and Hezbollah open; oil shortages; restrictions on offshore drilling as a result\nof oil spills \nQuadrant C\n (Low oil prices, relations deteriorate): Iran now feels the need to act in Hezbollah\u2019s\ndefense but lacks the resources to take on a crash Manhattan Project. Moreover, with oil prices low, it needs\nsupport from the global community. To keep up appearances, Iran continues its \u201ctalk tough\u201d policy on the one\nhand but puts its nuclear plans on the back burner.\nMilestones: Increase in \u201ctough talk\u201d rhetoric; glut of oil on the world market; skirmishes and deteriorating\nrelations between Israel and Hezbollah; noted reduction in nuclear materials going to Iran; reduction in demand\nfor oil driven by global recession.\nQuadrant D\n (Low oil prices, relations improve): Perhaps the best case scenario. If Iran interprets the\nimproving relations as a continuing trend, it may consider ways to live with Israel, despite its history of extreme\nrhetoric and action. This thawing in relations could prove to be a godsend for Iranian moderates who see this as\na possible time to improve relations with the West, especially as tough economic times continue.\nMilestones: Israel and Hezbollah talk or at least agree to reduce tensions; rise in popularity of moderates in\nIran; glut of oil in world markets; reduction in demand for oil driven by global recession.\nThe scenario-creation technique demonstrated above is not the only one used by the IC.\nThe \nNational Intelligence Council (NIC)\n is the IC\u2019s center for midterm and long-term\n181\nstrategic thinking. As much a \u201cthink tank\u201d as anything else, the NIC has produced a\nseries of future-looking volumes as part of its \nGlobal Trends\n series; scenarios are very\nmuch a part of the series. \nBox 6.2\n provides two globalization scenarios taken from \nGlobal\nTrends 2015\n, one of the earlier books in the series. As readers can see, the process used to\nconstruct these two scenarios differs from the one described above; in particular, more\nthan two driving forces were considered. Regardless, the \u201cspirit\u201d of scenario building\u2014\nstorytelling\u2014remains intact.\nBox 6.2\n \nTwo Globalization Scenarios\nScenario One: Inclusive Globalization\nA virtuous circle develops among technology, economic growth, demographic\nfactors, and effective governance, which enables a majority of the world\u2019s people to\nbenefit from globalization. Technological development and diffusion\u2014in some\ncases, triggered by severe environmental or health crises\u2014are utilized to grapple\neffectively with some problems of the developing world. Robust global economic\ngrowth\u2014spurred by a strong policy consensus on economic liberalization\u2014diffuses\nwealth widely and mitigates many demographic and resource problems.\nGovernance is effective at both \nthe national and international levels. In many\ncountries, the state\u2019s role shrinks, as its functions are privatized or performed by\npublic\u2013private partnerships, whereas global cooperation intensifies on many issues\nthrough a variety of international arrangements. Conflict is minimal within and\namong states benefiting from globalization. A minority of the world\u2019s people\u2014 in\nsub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East, Central and South Asia, and the Andean\nregion\u2014do not benefit from these positive changes, and internal conflicts persist in\nand around those countries left behind.\nScenario Two: Pernicious Globalization\nGlobal elites thrive, but the majority of the world\u2019s population fails to benefit from\nglobalization. Population growth and resource scarcities place heavy burdens on\nmany developing countries, and migration becomes a major source of interstate\ntension. Technologies not only fail to address the problems of developing countries\nbut also are exploited by negative and illicit networks and incorporated into\ndestabilizing weapons. The global economy splits into three: growth continues in\ndeveloped countries; many developing countries experience low or negative per\ncapita growth, resulting in a growing gap with the developed world; and the illicit\neconomy grows dramatically. Governance and political leadership are weak at both\nthe national and international levels. Internal conflicts increase, fueled by frustrated\n182\nexpectations, inequities, and heightened communal tensions; WMDs proliferate and\nare used in at least one internal conflict.\nSource:\n National Intelligence Council.

Global trends 2015: A dialogue about\nthe future with nongovernment experts.\nwww.dni.gov/nic/PDF_GIF_global/globaltrend2015.pdf.\nThe Emperor\u2019s Clothes Are Fair Game: Contrarian Methods\nAs \nChapter 5\n (\u201cBarriers to Analysis\u201d) made clear, one of the biggest problems in analysis\nis breaking down false consensus. Whether it takes the form of groupthink or a boss who\ndoes not appreciate receiving bad news, dissent is often suppressed. This has led in the\npast to risk-averse assessments and a tendency to reject all but the narrowest\npossibilities.\nTo help remedy this, the IC has devised what it calls \ncontrarian methods\n, which are\ndesigned to purposely inject dissent into any analytical situation. The theory behind this\nis twofold. On the one hand, it forces people to consider possibilities that, up to that\npoint, might have been rejected out of hand. Second, it may cause individuals to modify\ntheir positions once other lines of \nthought are considered. At the very least, individuals\nwill be forced to critically consider and defend their positions.\nPerhaps the best known contrarian method is \nDevil\u2019s Advocacy\n. This term originated\nin the sixteenth century when the Catholic Church held judicial proceedings to\ndetermine who should and should not be granted sainthood. One of the officials in this\ntrial was the \nAdvocatus Diaboli\n, literally the \u201cadvocate of the Devil,\u201d who was\nresponsible for listing every possible argument against granting canonization. In modern\ntimes, it has come to mean someone who argues a point he or she may not believe\nstrictly for the sake of argument. In the IC, especially in group situations, it is common\nto appoint someone as a devil\u2019s advocate. It is this person\u2019s responsibility to question\nevery conclusion or fact and to propose alternative hypotheses. Because the individual\nhas been appointed, they receive \u201cimmunity\u201d from the groups\u2019 or boss\u2019s enmity. The\nmain benefit of such a position is that it causes individuals to further check assumptions\nand mindsets they did not know they had. In most cases, it will either strengthen or\nmodify an existing position.\nOccasionally, there will be a group where the problem is not consensus but instead\ntwo or more competing and strongly held positions on a particular topic, with neither\nside willing to budge. When that occurs, an exercise known as \nTeam A/Team B\n can be\nused. Basically, each side drafts up an analysis in which the group puts forth its strongest\narguments for why its position is correct. The exercise can also have a debate phase\nwhere team members engage in oral argument. In this way, each side, as well as policy-\nmakers, can hear and understand both positions and the facts that support these\npositions. Occasionally, one group will persuade the other to adopt its position. As well,\n183\npolicymakers get to hear both sides of an argument, thereby permitting them to make a\nbetter informed decision.\nFinally, in today\u2019s world of asymmetric threats and terrorism, the adversary is always\ntrying to devise new methods of attack. In order to prevent the next 9/11, we have to be\nable to foresee it. Analysts use \nhigh-impact/low-probability analysis\n to assess possible\nevents that have a low probability of occurring but would be catastrophic if they did. To\nconduct such an analysis, a low probability event, such as the destruction of the\nBrooklyn Bridge, is identified. Next, analysts brainstorm plausible explanations for how\nsuch an attack could be carried out. As the analysis unfolds, analysts identify indicators\nor milestones that would signal that such an event was being planned or executed (e.g.,\nsurveillance of the bridge). Like the other contrarian methods, high-impact/low-\nprobability analysis is designed to dislodge mindsets that inhibit insight and thoughtful\nanalysis.\n184\nAnalytical Software\nNext to his brain, an analyst\u2019s best friend may be his computer. The volume of\ninformation that can be retrieved today and the rate at which it can be processed is truly\nstaggering. Increasingly, analysts use specially designed programs to assist them with\ntheir difficult and complex duties. Computers today can mine huge amounts of data,\nregularly discovering all sorts of needles in haystacks. They link together people and\nevents, bringing to light relationships that ordinarily would have been missed. Perhaps\none of the computer\u2019s greatest features is its ability to display data in such a way as to\nmake it much more understandable, especially to the lay person.\nMost importantly, computers are getting \u201csmarter\u201d everyday; their value today will\nlikely be quickly eclipsed by newer, better hardware and programs (see \nChapter 15\n,\n\u201cFuture of Intelligence\u201d). It is important to note, however, that a computer is only as\ngood as the analyst that operates it. No computer, in and of itself, has ever solved a crime\nor prevented a terrorist attack. Nevertheless, they act as a great force multiplier,\naccomplishing in seconds what once took weeks or months by hand.\nThere are numerous companies that develop and sell analytical soft-ware. Some of\nthese include i2, Visual Analytics, and Palantir. They each do roughly the same thing,\nalthough each comes with its own \u201cbells and whistles.\u201d Anyone who wishes to attain a\njob as an analyst in the IC today would be well advised to receive training and develop\nskills in computer analysis. \nChapter 13\n (\u201cCriminal Intelligence and Crime Analysis\u201d)\nprovides examples of how law enforcement agencies utilize computers.\n185\nConclusion\nThe IC today realizes that it has to do a better job of analyzing the information it\nreceives. Indeed, to one degree or another, most intelligence failures stem from failures\nof analysis. This situation will only become more complicated in the future as we\ncontinue to become inundated with greater and greater amounts of information.\nTechnological fixes, such as data mining and sophisticated computer programs, will\nprovide some assistance, but at its heart, analysis is best carried out by people. This\nbecomes complicated, for as we have seen, the human brain is not designed for this\nfunction. Mindsets, preconceptions, biases, and an ability to keep track of only so much\ninformation plague us as a species. Nevertheless, with hard work, it is possible to\nimprove the quality of analytical products. The DNI has made improving analysis a high\npriority; today, universities provide programs in intelligence studies. As well, there has\nbeen a renewed emphasis on using all source intelligence, developing critical thinking,\nand enhancing collaboration.\nFinally, the IC today is putting a great deal of effort into developing structured\nanalytical techniques to remedy the natural difficulties we face in thinking deeply about\nthings. There have been a few preliminary studies suggesting that structured techniques\nare, in fact, superior to unstructured analysis. To that end, we can expect to see the\ncontinued development and testing of methods as well as their uses in the IC. Whether\nthey will prove to be revolutionary remains to be seen; for now, they are a work in\nprogress.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nMany experts claim that most intelligence failures are the result of errors of\nanalysis. Does that surprise you? If enough information is collected, what\nmakes analysis so difficult?\n2\n. \nHow do you define \u201ccritical thinking?\u201d What steps does one take to think\ncritically?\n3\n. \nMany believe that the use of structured analytical techniques will improve\nintelligence analysis. Do you agree? Why or why not?\n4\n. \nACH is concerned with discovering the most likely future, whereas scenario\nanalysis is concerned with developing multiple plausible futures. Which\napproach do you think is the most valid? Why?\n5\n. \nExperts disagree on the extent to which technology will improve analysis in\nthe future. What do you think?

As history has\nshown, incorrect or misleading information can well influence leaders to make bad\ndecisions. What decision-makers require is intelligence rather than raw information.\nIn a perfect world, decision-makers would have all the necessary information at hand\nto confirm their opinions on a topic, but this is seldom the case. With the revolution in\ncommunications, collection, and sharing, there appears to be no shortage of information\non almost any subject. As a result, decision-makers frequently find themselves facing the\nchallenge of determining what information is important to assist in decision-making.\nUltimately, decision-makers must make the best decisions possible using the available\ninformation and intelligence.\nHistory is full of examples of both good and bad decisions made on incomplete\ninformation or intelligence; ultimately, leaders bear the responsibility of their decisions.\n191\nInformation and the Origin of the Intelligence Cycle\nIntelligence does not just occur; rather, it is drawn from information and is generally the\nresult of a process in which the information is organized, reviewed, vetted, and validated\n(Lowenthal, 2009). This process, which has developed over the years, is referred to as the\nintelligence cycle\n. It provides a visual representation of how the Intelligence\nCommunity (IC) ultimately answers a decision-maker\u2019s questions. Every IC agency\nteaches its analysts the intelligence cycle to provide them with the \u201cbig picture\u201d of how\nall the pieces in the process should fit together.\nReaders will recognize that we draw on previous chapters when describing the cycle\u2014\nin particular, the fundamentals of collection and analysis described in \nChapters 4\n, \n5\n, and\n6\n form the cornerstone of the process. But they are not the only important elements.\nMany components must work together with great synchronicity for the overall process\nto be successful.\nAlthough many nations, including the United States, have historically been involved\nin the collection of information and the development of intelligence for many years, the\ndevelopment of an intelligence cycle is relatively recent. U.S. Army intelligence\npublications from the World War I period identify collection, collation, and\ndissemination of military intelligence as essential duties, but there is no indication that\nthese functions were presented in a sequence or cycle.\nBetween World War I and World War II, military intelligence in the United States\nsuffered greatly from the personnel drawbacks fueled by the economic depression and\nthe isolationist movement that swept the nation. During this period, both the Army and\nthe Navy maintained separate military intelligence sections. Because the two services\nsuffered from a lack of coordinated effort, they sought to improve coordination and\ncooperation by refining the intelligence process.\nBy the 1920s, military intelligence officers had identified four distinct functions for\ntactical combat intelligence: establishment of information/intelligence requirement\nneeds; collection; \u201cutilization,\u201d which is viewed in today\u2019s terms as analysis; and\ndissemination of the intelligence to the user. Although the work of these military\nintelligence officers did not specifically mention an intelligence cycle, the foundational\ncomponents of the \u201ccycle\u201d had been identified and the steps for the intelligence process\noutlined.\nWorld War II inspired a revolution in both diplomatic and military intelligence.\nExpansion of the U.S. Department of State, the creation of the Office of Strategic\nServices, and the growth of military intelligence redefined U.S. intelligence efforts and\nwith it, set the stage for the nation\u2019s postwar environment.\nIn the 1948 book, \nIntelligence Is for Commanders\n, authors Robert Glass and Philip\nDavidson used the term \u201cintelligence cycle\u201d for what appears to be the first time\n192\n(Wheaton, 2011). By 1948, intelligence practitioners had identified the general steps of\nthe cycle and coined its name, but the question remains\u2014what was the historical origin\nof the cycle? Many believe the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) developed it during its\nearliest years, but that conclusion remains unproven.\n193\nThe Intelligence Cycle\nSeveral versions of the intelligence cycle exist today; some contain five steps, whereas\nothers contain six. Some appear in the shape of a wheel with the steps unfolding in a\nclockwise direction, while others depict the directional flow as going the opposite way.\nThe most current iteration, articulated by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), is\nnot a wheel\u2014 instead, it is a six-step, interconnected process (see \nFigure 7.1\n). In the\nopinion of your authors, the differences are trivial; what is important is understanding\nthe process holistically and seeing how each piece of the puzzle fits.\nThe cycle serves as a model\u2014it does not perfectly represent reality but rather provides\na pedagogical tool for students to understand how intelligence works in the real world.\nOn a day-to-day basis, analysts, collectors, \nand decision-makers rarely if ever refer to the\ncycle; its processes are basically internalized by all members of the IC, who develop an\nintuitive understanding about how the cycle does, or does not, function.\n194\nFigure 7.1\n The Intelligence Cycle. (Source: Office of the Director of National Intelligence)\nLike any model, the intelligence cycle has flaws; as we discuss later, some critics think\nit is so flawed that it should be discarded altogether (a blog posting by Mercyhurst\nUniversity professor Kris Wheaton not-so-subtly suggests \u201cLet\u2019s Kill the Intelligence\nCycle\u201d; Wheaton, 2011).\nNevertheless, for students just learning about the IC, the intelligence cycle provides a\nsnapshot of how things fit together; in our view, the benefits of this outweigh the\nminuses. That said, students should understand that things rarely unfold in the nice, neat\nmanner suggested by the cycle. Instead, real life tends to be messy and chaotic, especially\nin the fast-paced world of the IC. Decision-makers are often not content to wait for a\nfinely finished product\u2014 they want information NOW, even if a source\u2019s credibility has\nnot been firmly established or the information has not been subjected to analysis. As\nwell, \nanalysts often go back to collectors many times, asking for updates or new\ninformation to fill gaps. Likewise, dissemination often unfolds in a piecemeal fashion,\nwith intelligence provided based on \nad hoc\n requests. Steps of the cycle are often skipped\nif time is of the essence.\nThe DNI describes its version of the cycle this way (Director of National Intelligence,\n2011: 10):\nThe Intelligence Cycle is the process of developing raw information into finished intelligence for use by\npolicymakers, military commanders, and other consumers in decisionmaking [sic]. This six-step cyclical process\nis highly dynamic, continuous, and never-ending. The sixth step, evaluation (which includes soliciting feedback\nfrom users) is conducted for each of the other five steps individually and for the Intelligence Cycle as a whole.\nRepresenting the intelligence process as a cycle intentionally implies certain things.\nHistorically, steps have been sequential, with step one preceding step two and so forth.\nThe DNI version more closely resembles reality\u2014by the direction of the arrows, the\nreader can see how certain steps may be skipped (e.g., unanalyzed, raw intelligence may\nbe passed directly to the consumer if time is short). Additionally, the dynamic nature of\nthe cycle underscores that intelligence is an ongoing process with the beginning of the\nnext intelligence cycle commencing as new information is collected, assessed, and\nprocessed in response to the intelligence gained from the last cycle. Conceptually, the\nintelligence cycle never ends.\nWe describe the intelligence cycle below. The DNI\u2019s description of each step appears\nin \nBox 7.1\n.\nBox 7.1\n \nDNI\u2019s Intelligence Cycle Explained\nPlanning and Direction: Establish the Consumer\u2019s Intelligence\nRequirements and Plan Intelligence Activities Accordingly\n195\nThe planning and direction step sets the stage for the Intelligence Cycle. It is the\nspringboard from which all Intelligence Cycle activities are launched. Oftentimes,\nthe direction part of the step precedes the planning part. Generally, in such cases,\nthe consumer has a requirement for a specific product. That product may be a full\nreport, a graphic image, or raw information that is collected, processed, and\ndisseminated, but it skips the analysis and production step. Given the customer\u2019s\nrequirement, the intelligence organization tasked with generating the product will\nthen plan its Intelligence Cycle activities.\nCollection: Gather the Raw Data Required to Produce the Finished\nProduct\nData collection is performed to gather raw data related to the five basic intelligence\nsources [geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), human intelligence (HUMINT),\nmeasurement and signature intelligence (MASINT), open-source intelligence\n(OSINT), and signals intelligence (SIGINT)]. The sources of the raw data may\ninclude, but are not limited to: news reports, aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and\ngovernment and public documents.\nProcessing and Exploitation: Convert the Raw Data into a\nComprehensible Format That Is Usable for Production of the Finished\nProduct\nThe processing and exploitation step \u2026 involves the use of highly trained and\nspecialized personnel and technologically sophisticated equipment to turn the raw\ndata into usable and understandable information. Data translation, data decryption,\nand interpretation of filmed images and other imagery are only a few of the\nprocesses used for converting data stored on film, magnetic, or other media into\ninformation ready for analysis and production.\nAnalysis and Production: Integrate, Evaluate, Analyze, and Prepare\nthe Processed Information for Inclusion in the Finished Product\nThe analysis and production step also requires highly trained and specialized\npersonnel (in this case, analysts) to give meaning to the processed information and\nto prioritize it against known requirements. Synthesizing the processed information\ninto a finished, actionable intelligence product enables the information to be useful\nto the customer. Note that, in some cases, the Intelligence Cycle may skip this step\n(e.g., when the consumer needs only specific reported information or products such\n196\nas raw imagery). This was the case during the Cuban Missile Crisis (October 1962),\nwhen President Kennedy needed only the actual number of pieces of Soviet\nequipment in Cuba and facts concerning reports on observed Soviet activity with\nno analysis of that information.\nDissemination: Deliver the Finished Product to the Consumer That\nRequested It and to Others as Applicable\nThe consumer that requested the information receives the finished product, usually\nvia electronic transmission. Dissemination of the information typically is\naccomplished through such means as websites, e-mail, Web 2.0 collaboration tools,\nand hardcopy distribution. The final product is referred to as \u201cfinished intelligence.\u201d\nAfter the product is disseminated, further gaps in the intelligence may be identified,\nand the Intelligence Cycle begins all over again.\nEvaluation: Continually Acquire Feedback During the Intelligence\nCycle and Evaluate That Feedback to Refine Each Individual Step and\nthe Cycle as a Whole\nConstant evaluation and feedback from consumers are extremely important to\nenabling those involved in the Intelligence Cycle to adjust and refine their activities\nand analysis to better meet consumers\u2019 evolving information needs.\nSource:\n Director of National Intelligence.

This is a crucial step in the process, for it is here\nthat the question to be examined is formulated. As every researcher knows, if one does\nnot ask the right question, every answer will be wrong. Although policymakers often ask\nthe questions that direct intelligence efforts, IC personnel usually need to reformulate the\nquestions provided to them; if the questions are too broad, they must be broken down\ninto something more specific and discrete. As discussed in previous chapters, the\nquestion, \u201cWill Mexico be a threat to the United States in the next three years?\u201d is overly\nbroad to the point of meaninglessness. What is meant by \u201cthreat\u201d\u2014drugs entering the\nUnited States, illegal aliens, violence spilling across the border, or something else\naltogether? Ideally, policymakers will assist in refining the issues; however, analysts are\n197\noften lefton their own to figure out the actual questions the policymaker wants answered\n(or those that are even answerable).\nAs experts in a particular area, analysts often ask their own questions; in this way,\nthey can provide an \u201cearly warning\u201d to policymakers who may be unaware that a\nparticular issue is of potential importance. For example, in 2004, Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation (FBI) agents warned Congress and the Bush Administration of a potential\nmeltdown in the mortgage industry; with America\u2019s singular focus on terrorism at the\ntime, few had considered the significance of such an issue, or how mortgage fraud might\nlead to a national economic recession just a few years later. This is not unusual. Mark\nLowenthal uses the analogy of a child\u2019s soccer game to describe how agencies tend to\npursue the \u201cissue of the day\u201d rather than addressing all issues of importance. According\nto Lowenthal, very young soccer players tend to go for the ball rather than maintain\ntheir positions on the soccer field; this ultimately leads to their defeat. IC agencies often\ncollectively flock to issues \nthat are most visible, such as terrorism, while neglecting\nothers; he terms this the \nswarm ball\n phenomenon (Lowenthal, 2009).\nOnce a question has been formulated, a plan is devised to collect the appropriate\ninformation to properly answer the question. These are the collection plans and\nrequirements described in \nChapter 4\n (\u201cCollection\u201d); as readers will recall, the IC has\nmany \u201cINTs\u201d at its disposal. Various considerations, such as budget, lead time, and\nappropriateness of coverage, determine which collection platforms to use. For example,\ngeospatial intelligence (GEOINT) may not be appropriate for a particular mission,\nwhereas other INTs, such as human intelligence (HUMINT), may provide the required\nanswers. As a result, many individuals should have input into the plan\u2014analysts can\ndescribe the information they need to conduct their analysis, collectors can weigh in\nregarding the feasibility of the plans and the best way to collect the information, and\ndecision-makers can make the final judgment based on budgets, time constraints, and\ncompeting demands.\nOnce collection techniques have been identified, they are prioritized; anticipated\ninformation sources are identified and various agencies are tasked with collection\nobjectives [e.g., the National Security Agency (NSA) is told to obtain signals intelligence\n(SIGINT) on a particular individual].\nPlanning and direction are both the beginning and ending points of the intelligence\ncycle\u2014once the end product is presented to a policymaker, they may formulate new\nquestions and requests for additional intelligence, thus starting the cycle over again. To\nkeep the endlessness of the intelligence cycle from leading to a loss of focus, effective\npriority setting by the Executive Branch as well as the leadership of individual agencies\nand oversight of Congress ensures that the IC remains properly focused on matters of\nimportance.\nStep Two: Collection\n198\nThe second phase in the cycle is collection, which includes the gathering of raw data and\ndelivery of information for appropriate processing or production. In some instances,\ncollection sources may provide raw data directly to the consuming agency for immediate\naction. Effective collection depends on the use of a variety of mutually reinforcing\nsources. As described in \nChapter 4\n (\u201cCollection\u201d), today\u2019s IC favors the \u201call-source\u201d\napproach, where agencies utilize as many types of collection platforms as feasible.\nInformation and data collection are critical, for without raw information flowing into\nthe cycle, intelligence cannot be developed. Information may be drawn from open,\ntechnical, and secret sources. Examples of open sources include foreign and domestic\nbroadcasts, newspapers, periodicals, and books. Technical sources include, but are not\nlimited to, cyber-based sources, electronics, and satellite information. Secret sources of\ninformation \ninclude those who have gained access to sensitive or protected information\nfrom areas such as other intelligence agents, governments, private sources, or defectors.\nAt this point the reader may wonder, what drives the process? Do analysts always\nrequest information, or do collectors provide what they think analysts need? In reality,\nthe process works both ways. Although it would be nice to have a well-planned, orderly\nflow of information, it is generally a chaotic process, with information constantly\nstreaming in from a variety of sources. This is why the processing/organizing step is so\nimportant. As information begins to flow in, analysts may decide there are certain \u201cgaps\u201d\nin coverage; in other words, they may need different or additional information. As a\nresult, they can send a \nrequest for information (RFI)\n to collectors in the field. The Joint\nChiefs of Staff define RFIs as:\nAny specific time-sensitive \nad hoc\n requirement for intelligence information or products to support an ongoing\ncrisis or operation not necessarily related to standing requirements or scheduled intelligence production. A\nrequest for information can be initiated to respond to operational requirements and will be validated in\naccordance with the combatant command\u2019s procedures. (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2007: GL-15)\nIt is essential that analysts and collectors share a common understanding of each other\u2019s\nroles. If not, confusion and aggravation may result. Without an appreciation for the\nanalytical process, a collector might ask \u201cwhy do the analysts need this?\u201d Likewise,\nanalysts who have no knowledge of the challenges collectors face may make\nunreasonable demands or grow frustrated when their requests are not immediately\nfilled.\nStep Three: Processing and Exploitation\nRaw information is usually not in a form that allows for immediate analysis; first, it\nmust be \nprocessed\n, and in some cases translated or decrypted. Although this step may\nsound technical and mundane, it is crucial\u2014an inability to decode or translate a\ndocument can cause the intelligence process to grind to a halt. In 1990, radical Muslim El\nSayyid Nosair assassinated Jewish Rabbi Meir Khane in New York City. In Nosair\u2019s\napartment, police discovered boxes of documents written in Arabic. Assuming Nosair\n199\nwas a \u201clone wolf\u201d and attaching no immediacy to the documents, they remained\nuntranslated. However, after the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, authorities\ndecided the documents merited scrutiny. Once translated, they turned out to be bomb-\nmaking manuals and somewhat cryptic plans to attack the Trade Centers. Had they been\ntranslated at the time, it is possible the attack may have been thwarted (Bergen, 2001).\nToday, people who speak critical languages such as Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Pashto,\nand other dialects are in high demand in the IC; the amount of material that requires\ntranslation remains voluminous. Additionally, modern technology has made computer\nencryption quite difficult to \u201ccrack.\u201d To counter this, the NSA employs numerous\nmathematicians and cryptanalysts, or \u201ccode-breakers\u201d to decrypt encoded\ncommunications.\nThe processing step has become increasingly important in recent years for two\nreasons. Given the sheer volume of information in the world today, keeping it organized\nis a herculean task, requiring the use of sophisticated software and advanced search\nengines. Additionally, the more technology advances, the more processing needs to\noccur. For example, every time a new satellite advance is made, new techniques for\ninterpreting information and imagery need to be developed.\nSecond, and perhaps more challenging, advanced encryption has rendered some\ndevices unreadable. In 2016, the FBI became embroiled in a legal dispute with Apple\nwhen the company refused to assist the Bureau in accessing the iPhone 5C of Syed\nFarook, a gunman who killed 14 co-workers in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino,\nCalifornia. While the FBI was able to hire a third-party to defeat the security of the\nphone, the issue remains far from settled. In \nChapter 15\n (\u201cFuture of Intelligence\u201d), we\ndiscuss the issue of encryption and its implications for intelligence.\nFortunately, not all information requires processing. Some information may be in a\nform suitable for analysis in the state in which it was collected.\nStep Four: Analysis and Production\nThe fourth step of the cycle is the analysis and production of finished intelligence. All\nintelligence starts with the available facts, but then ventures into the unknown. As\nChapters 5\n (\u201cBarriers to Analysis\u201d) and 6 (\u201cAnalytical Methods\u201d) discussed, much effort\ngoes into converting information into a usable form.\nIn this phase, intelligence analysts are critical; they integrate data and place the\nevaluated information in context. Analysts collect, evaluate, and produce an assessment\nwithin an assigned field or substantive area, and then forecast future trends or outcomes\nfrom incoming information. They are encouraged to include alternative futures in their\nassessments and to warn about possible developments that could threaten or, conversely,\nprovide opportunities. Analysts may also develop RFIs at this stage. As noted previously,\nin their role, analysts inform policy; they do not write it.\nSome agencies recognize five categories of finished intelligence: current intelligence,\n200\nestimative intelligence, warning intelligence, research intelligence, and scientific and\ntechnical intelligence. For a detailed explanation of \nthese types of intelligence, refer to\nChapter 11\n (\u201cWriting and Briefing for the Intelligence Community\u201d).\nStep Five: Dissemination\nThe fifth step in the process is \ndissemination\n of the intelligence to its intended audience.\nDuring dissemination, intelligence is delivered to decision-makers for them to use in\nwhatever way they deem appropriate. Depending on its importance and time-sensitivity,\nintelligence may be disseminated directly to users, or it can be sent to an accessible\ndatabase from which it can be accessed when needed. Intelligence flows by any number\nof channels or methods.\nThis step can \u201cmake or break\u201d the entire process. As we discussed in \nChapter 1\n (\u201cAn\nOverview of Intelligence\u201d), the IC speaks its own language. Analysts and briefers must\nbe adept at getting their points across in a way that is acceptable to the consumer, lest\nthey find themselves in the same position as the legendary Cassandra, referred to\npreviously in \nChapter 1\n (\u201cAn Overview of Intelligence\u201d). \nChapter 11\n (\u201cWriting and\nBriefing for the Intelligence Community\u201d) discusses in great detail how the IC expects\nintelligence to be disseminated both orally and in writing.\nStep Six: Evaluation\nEvaluation is not so much a discrete step as it is a constant process. Consumers\ncontinually provide feedback to enhance the entire effort. Without this important\ninformation, the process cannot be improved. Some contend that there is a further step to\nthe cycle, that of utilization. Their reasoning goes that utilization is the entire reason the\nprocess exists in the first place\u2014to arm leaders with tools to help them make better\ndecisions (this is the premise that intelligence should be actionable).\nTypically, utilization of intelligence fuels a continuation of the cycle as new\nintelligence requirements emerge. The number of intelligence users may vary according\nto different sources of information. Although we do not include utilization in our version\nof the cycle, it is still a critical factor in decision-making and the execution of the actions\nresulting from those decisions.\n201\nCritical Reactions to the Intelligence Cycle\nAlthough it has been taught for decades, the intelligence cycle is not without critics. A\ncase can be made that collection and analysis, which are supposed to work in tandem, in\nfact work more properly in parallel. Also, decision-makers often do not wait for the\ndelivery of intelligence before making policy \ndecisions; alternatively, even if they receive\nintelligence, there is no guarantee that it will factor into their ultimate decision.\nAuthor and former intelligence analyst Arthur Hulnick has voiced various criticisms\nof the cycle in the past. He notes that policy officials often seem to want intelligence to\nsupport policy rather than to inform it. He further suggests that the cycle does not\naccurately represent the actual intelligence process because it ignores at least two major\nfunctions: counterintelligence and covert operations. In Hulnick\u2019s view, the intelligence\nenterprise could be better described in terms of a matrix whose three \u201cpillars\u201d would\ninclude collection, production, and support and services (Hulnick, 2006).\nLowenthal (2009) also acknowledges flaws with the traditional intelligence cycle that\nhe calls \u201coverly simple.\u201d Ethnographers Johnston and Johnston suggest that the\ntraditional intelligence cycle model should either be redesigned to accurately depict the\nintended goal, or care should be taken to explicitly discuss its limitations whenever it is\nused (Johnston & Johnston, 2007).\nOne of the more recent moves away from the intelligence cycle has been Robert\nClark\u2019s target-centric approach to intelligence analysis. Clark attempts to describe both\nthe current intelligence process and to examine how it should be performed differently\nin an integrated, networked world. His primary suggestion is that, as constructed, the\ncycle is slow and clumsy, because of its imagined linearity. He advocates viewing\nintelligence as a collaborative process where all stakeholders (collectors, analysts, and\nconsumers) are integral to the collaboration and actions unfold simultaneously (Clark,\n2003). Although criticisms of the intelligence cycle are valid, its value in providing\nstructure for the process of turning information into intelligence is difficult to reject.\n202\nConclusion\nThe intelligence cycle has proven to be a valuable tool in the instruction of the process of\nturning information into finished intelligence for several generations. The mere\ndevelopment of intelligence, however, does not ensure that the intelligence will be\nproperly distributed, interpreted, or utilized by the decision-makers or policymakers.\nInformation may be collected and converted into intelligence, and the intelligence may\nbe disseminated, but unless it is exploited through decision and action, it has served no\npurpose.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nDoes the intelligence cycle adequately portray the process of retrieving and\ndisbursing intelligence?\n2\n. \nHow might you change the intelligence cycle to reflect, more precisely,\nintelligence as it exists in the real world?\n3\n. \nDo models such as the intelligence cycle help or hinder people\u2019s ability to\nunderstand the intelligence process?\n4\n. \nIs one step in the intelligence cycle more significant or more important than\nothers?\n203\nKey Terms\nDissemination\nEvaluation\nIntelligence cycle\nPlanning and direction\nProcessing\nRequest for Information\nSwarm ball\n204\nReferences\nBergen, P.

As the name implies,\ndecision advantage is concerned with providing decision-makers with more information\nthan their adversary, thus allowing them to make better choices. It is basically achieved\nby meeting two goals: knowing as much as possible about a situation while denying that\nsame knowledge to the enemy.\nIntelligence agencies collect information and analyze it to meet the first goal; they\nengage in \ncounterintelligence\n to achieve the second. The National Security Act of 1947\ndefined counterintelligence as (United States Congress, 1947: 6):\nInformation gathered and activities conducted to protect against espionage, other intelligence activities,\nsabotage, or assassinations conducted by or on behalf of foreign governments or elements thereof, foreign\norganizations or foreign persons, or international terrorist activities.\nThis definition remains generally correct today, although it is incomplete. For example, it\ndoes not include domestic terrorists or large criminal organizations, both of which\nregularly engage in intelligence operations against the government.\nMany people have false preconceptions regarding intelligence. In the first place, they\nmay believe that, with the fall of the Soviet Union, espionage activities have declined. In\nfact, exactly the opposite has happened; some opine that there are more Russian spies\noperating in the United States today than there were at the height of the Cold War. As\nwell, there is a perception that countries only spy on adversaries. In fact, this is not the\ncase. George Washington once remarked (Washington, n.d.):\nMy policy has been, and will continue to be, while I have the honor to remain in the administration of the\ngovernment, to be upon friendly terms with, but independent of, all the nations of the earth. To share in the\nbroils of none. To fulfill our own engagements.\nThat quote perfectly describes the foreign policy strategies of most nations; intelligence\noperations support policy. In his book \nIntelligence: From Secrets to Policy\n, former Central\nIntelligence Agency (CIA) official Mark Lowenthal asks the question, \u201cWho spies on\nwhom?\u201d With few exceptions, the answer is: everyone spies on everyone else. For\nexample, the United States is closely allied with the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia,\nand New Zealand and shares much intelligence with them. This alliance can be traced\nback to the UKUSA agreement, a top-secret document signed by the two countries on\nMarch 5, 1946. In the agreement, the United Kingdom and the United States agreed to\nshare signals intelligence with each other and to not wiretap each other\u2019s leaders. Over\nthe years, this agreement was extended to include Canada, Australia, and New Zealand,\nserving as the legal basis for a group known as the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d (UK National Archives,\n207\n2010). However, beyond that short list of five nations, everyone else is fair game. Our\nallies feel similarly; in 1986, Naval Analyst Jonathan Pollard pled guilty to passing\nclassified information to Israel, a strong ally of the United States.\nWhen most people think about counterintelligence, they envision a reactive enterprise,\nconcerned primarily with protecting sensitive information and rooting out spies in one\u2019s\norganization. This, of course, is a major part of counterintelligence, but it is not the only\npart. Proactive operations, such as deliberately spreading \ndisinformation\n, can confuse\nan adversary and prevent them from learning what is truly going on.\nIn general, counterintelligence can be divided into \ndefensive\n and \noffensive\noperations.\n1\n As the name implies, defensive operations are those in which an\norganization looks closely at itself to ensure that sensitive information is not\ncompromised. This includes instituting security measures, conducting extensive\nbackground checks and reinvestigations, and looking for spies within the agency.\nOffensive operations are those that look outside the organization to detect enemy\nespionage activities as well as the attempts made to mitigate the damage done by those\nefforts. This includes investigating suspected foreign spies and, once detected, trying to\nconvince them to spy against their country of origin. Indeed, successfully recruiting\nsomeone to become a double agent is considered a great victory. Foreign spies that\ncannot be \u201cturned\u201d are usually arrested or, if they have diplomatic immunity, as is often\nthe case, are declared \npersona non-grata\n, which means they cannot remain in the\nUnited States. In the case of domestic groups, such as the Ku Klux Klan, law enforcement\nagencies also attempt to recruit members to provide information on a long-term basis. At\none time, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) referred to such individuals as \nassets\nin contrast to those who supplied information in strictly criminal cases; these individuals\nwere referred to as \ninformants\n.\nDouble agents can be a godsend to the agency that employs them; likewise, they can\nbe devastating to the organization they are betraying. Take the case of former FBI\nSpecial Agent Robert Hanssen (see \nBox 8.1\n). He supplied a treasure trove of information\nto the Soviet Union and later Russia, compromising nearly every operation the United\nStates had in place in the 1990s.\nBox 8.1\n \nRobert Hanssen\nRobert Hanssen, born in Chicago, Illinois, was the son of a Chicago police officer\n(\nFigure 8.2\n). According to some accounts, his father was abusive and generally\ndisparaging of his son. Hanssen was bright and did well academically, enough so to\nbe accepted into Northwestern University\u2019s dentistry school; however, he soon\ndecided that he did not want to be a dentist and switched to a business program.\nHanssen entered the FBI as a Special Agent in 1976, being first assigned to the\nGary, Indiana office and, in 1978, to New York City. Upon his assignment to New\nYork, he began working Soviet counterintelligence matters. Almost immediately, he\n208\napproached Soviet military intelligence and offered to work as a mole. As Hanssen\nmoved through the ranks of FBI management, he had assignments at FBI\nHeadquarters in Washington and the New York Field Office, intermittently\nengaging in espionage.\nAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, Hanssen continued to work for Russian\nintelligence. As part of his assignments, he was privy to a great deal of highly\nsensitive information from both the FBI and CIA; he provided much of this to the\nRussians. During the period of Hanssen\u2019s treachery, the IC realized that it had been\ninfiltrated by a mole. When Aldrich Ames was arrested in 1994, the IC thought it\nhad its man; yet, operations continued to be compromised and foreign agents\ncaptured. The IC focused in on a CIA analyst named Brian Kelley, believing him to\nbe the culprit. Despite some clear clues pointing to Hanssen, he was ignored. At one\npoint, Hanssen was put in charge of the \u201cmole hunt,\u201d essentially looking for\nhimself. Finally, the FBI found a Russian businessman who had a tape of the\nAmerican spy talking with a KGB agent. Eventually, the voice on the tape was\nrecognized as belonging to Hanssen.\nImmediately after this revelation, Hanssen was put under constant surveillance.\nHe was arrested on February 18, 2001, at a park near his home in Virginia as he\ndropped off a satchel of documents for his Russian handlers. He agreed to plead\nguilty to 15 counts of espionage in order to escape the death penalty and was\nsentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nMany theories have been offered to explain Hanssen\u2019s betrayal of the United\nStates. Although he claims he did it for money (the Soviets agreed to pay him $1.4\nmillion in cash and diamonds over a 22-year period), others maintain that he felt\n\u201cdisrespected\u201d by the FBI. If his motivation remains murky, the damage he did does\nnot\u2014one report issued by the Justice Department declared Hanssen\u2019s spying to be\n\u201cpossibly the worst intelligence disaster in U.S. history\u201d (U.S. Department of Justice,\n2002). As a result of the Hanssen affair, the FBI significantly enhanced its security\nprocedures.\nEvery intelligence and law enforcement agency is involved with counterintelligence to\nsome degree. However, in the United States, investigating espionage and discovering\nforeign spies is primarily the duty of the FBI, which ranks it as its number two priority,\nimmediately behind terrorism. Overseas, the CIA, State Department, and military all\nengage in counterintelligence activities. The CIA and the military actively attempt to\nrecruit spies, otherwise known as \nagents\n, employed by foreign intelligence services,\nwhereas the State Department takes the lead role in ensuring that U.S. embassies are\nphysically secure and free from infiltration.\nCounterintelligence as a function of intelligence agencies, however, goes far beyond\ndetecting and monitoring the activities of foreign intelligence services and investigating\nemployees suspected of espionage. Counterintelligence is an integral part of the\n209\nintelligence process. All agencies that undertake intelligence collection, whether by\nhuman or technical means, must constantly ensure that what they collect is genuine.\nThis requires continuous evaluation of their sources as well as the information gathered\nfrom them. Intelligence analysts, who are familiar with the totality of information on a\nparticular topic, are often in a position to detect anomalies. Historically, intelligence\nagencies have not performed this crucial function very well. Virtually all have suffered\nsevere losses due to a failure to recognize anomalous behavior on the part of their own\nemployees. Some have also had problems recognizing anomalies in the behavior of their\nsources or in the appearance or actions of their targets.\nAldrich Ames was a CIA analyst and officer who was convicted of spying for the\nSoviet Union and Russia in 1994; despite poor performance ratings and evidence of a\ndrinking problem, he was allowed to remain in important and sensitive positions. In the\nwake of the Ames case, the IC made sweeping changes to its counterintelligence\ninfrastructure. A new policy board, reporting to the Assistant to the President for\nNational Security Affairs, was established to coordinate counterintelligence activities\nand resolve interagency disagreements, and the National Counterintelligence Center was\ncreated \nto share and evaluate information regarding foreign intelligence threats. In\naddition, the CIA made numerous improvements to its counterintelligence and security\nposture. The question remains whether these changes will have a long-term, positive\neffect.\nCounterintelligence must be viewed not as an annoying intrusion, but rather as an\nintegral part of the intelligence process. It must focus not only on protecting one\u2019s own\nsensitive information but also on efforts to manipulate collection and analysis through\ndouble agents or other means. This activity requires a certain openness of mind and a\nwillingness to balance continually the conclusions drawn from intelligence with the\npossibility of deliberate deception by a target.\nIt is important to understand that there can be a distinct tension between security and\nthe ease of carrying out operations. With regard to the Project ULTRA intercepts\nreceived during World War II, the Allies went to great lengths to develop ways to act on\nthe intelligence they gathered without tipping their hand as to how it was obtained. In\nthe case of German supply convoys, for example, aerial scouting squadrons would be\nsent to visually spot the convoy, thereby convincing the Germans this was how they had\nbeen discovered. In this way, only a few people knew the source of the information; this\nmade it less likely that a spy would penetrate the project or that its existence would\ninadvertently be leaked. Many civilians have a difficult time understanding why\nagencies do not share information with one another more effectively. There are many\nreasons for this, but at least one concerns the reality that the more information is shared,\nthe more likely it will become compromised. At least some in the intelligence world\nwould agree with Benjamin Franklin\u2019s admonition that \u201cto whom thy secret thou dost\ntell, to him thy freedom thou dost sell\u201d (Franklin, 2008).\nPerhaps the most intriguing question related to counterintelligence asks, \u201cWhy would\nsomeone betray their country?\u201d This is a question that the intelligence community has\n210\nlong sought to answer. Counterintelligence instructors have coined an acronym, MICE,\nto help explain motives behind spying. The mnemonic device opines the following\nreasons: 1) money; 2) ideology; 3) compromise; and 4) ego (Shane, 2008). Aside from\nMICE, the intelligence community has long sought to discern if certain personality traits\nmake a person more or less susceptible to spying. In the late 1980s, the CIA\ncommissioned a study called \u201cProject SLAMMER,\u201d where it used \u201cstate-of-the-art\nbehavioral science techniques\u201d to \u201cbetter understand and deter espionage through the\ndirect assessment of convicted American spies\u201d (Director of Central Intelligence, 1990).\nQuite simply, the CIA and FBI hoped that by interviewing former IC employees\nconvicted of spying, it could develop a personality profile of a spy. The report found that\nspies \nshared certain beliefs about themselves, stating (Director of Central Intelligence,\n1990):\nHe is special, even unique.\nHis situation is not satisfactory.\nHe has no other (easier) option (than to engage in espionage).\nHe is only doing what others frequently do.\nHe is not a bad person.\nHis performance in his government job (if presently employed) is separate from\nespionage; espionage does not (really) discount his contribution in the\nworkplace.\nSecurity procedures do not (really) apply to him.\nSecurity programs (e.g., briefings) have no meaning for him, unless they connect\nwith something with which he can personally identify.\nFurthermore, investigators found that spies typically view their crime as victimless. The\nIC employees, despite their actions, do not view themselves as traitors to their country.\nThough Project SLAMMER\u2019s findings are intriguing, later researchers deemed the\ninterviews inconclusive. The interviewees were subjected to different forms of\nquestioning, carried out by different IC professionals, over many years. The research\ndesign lacked the uniformity necessary to draw any sort of formal conclusions.\nFurthermore, the sample size was too small to merit any broad findings. Nonetheless, the\nIC continues to examine Project SLAMMER data in hopes of discovering utility. In\nrecent years, Project SLAMMER has been housed at the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit,\nwhere psychologists seek to organize the data into a workable model.\nRecently, there has been concern among counterintelligence professionals about the\nshifting nature of \u201cspies.\u201d Two individuals have highlighted a shiftin spying: Chelsea\n(formerly \u201cBradley\u201d) Manning (\nFigure 8.1\n) and Edward Snowden. Both Manning and\nSnowden created counterintelligence catastrophes for the U.S. intelligence community\nby serving as self-declared whistle-blowers and releasing large amounts of classified\ninformation to the public via the internet. Manning, a twenty-three year old Army\nintelligence analyst stationed in Iraq, began leaking classified documents to a group\n211\nknown as \u201cWikileaks\u201d in 2010. Included in his leaks were videos of U.S. military strikes\nin Iraq and Afghanistan, 251,287 State Department diplomatic cables, and 482,832 Army\nreports. As a low-level analyst, Manning was fluent with computers and, after becoming\ndisgruntled during his military tour in Iraq, began bragging to online hackers about his\naccess to secret information. His decision to leak classified materials, which he copied\nduring work hours to a blank Lady Gaga compact-disc, had worldwide ramifications. By\nleaking the classified information to Wikileaks, Manning saw hundreds of thousands of\ngovernment documents uploaded to the internet for the entire world to read (Nakashima,\n2011).\nWikileaks, a non-profit organization committed to leaking classified information, was\nfounded by Julian Assange, an Australian journalist, publisher, and computer\nprogrammer. Assange, along with Manning, became the public faces of the intelligence\nleaks, which the U.S. sought to immediately condemn. Faced with prosecution, Assange\nsought asylum in 2012 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remains at the\ntime of this writing. Manning, however, faced military prosecution for her actions. In\n2013, she was convicted to thirty-five years of imprisonment under the Espionage Act for\nmishandling classified information. On January 17, 2017, President Barack Obama\ncommuted Manning\u2019s remaining sentence, which led to her release from prison.\nFigure 8.1\n \nThen-PFC Bradley Manning in his official Army photograph. (Source: U.S. Army)\nThough Manning claimed she leaked the information to expose wrongdoing among\n212\ngovernment officials, her actions were widely criticized. Rather than selecting the\ndocuments that would expose any alleged wrongdoing, Manning and Wikileaks released\nlarge reams of documents, some sensitive in nature and extremely damaging to U.S.\nintelligence sources and methods. At Manning\u2019s trial, the State Department testified that\nManning\u2019s release of its diplomatic cables had \u201ca chilling effect on American foreign\nrelations,\u201d claiming that even three years after the leaks, foreign government officials,\nbusinesses, educators and journalists remained reluctant to speak openly with American\nforeign service officers. Furthermore, many within the intelligence community believe\nthat the Wikileaks\u2019 release of Manning\u2019s documents led to the deaths of intelligence\nsources.\nAs the aftermath of Manning and Wikileak\u2019s release of classified information began to\nfade, a new release of intelligence would once again rock the IC. In 2013, Edward\nSnowden, a computer system administrator working as a Booz Allen Hamilton\ncontractor for the NSA, leaked classified information about the NSA\u2019s SIGINT programs.\nPrior to the leak, Snowden flew to Hong Kong, where he met with \nGuardian\n journalists\nGlenn Greenwald and Ewen MacAskill, as well as documentary filmmaker Laura\nPoitras.\nOver the course of several days, Snowden explained the NSA\u2019s programs to the\njournalists. Holed up in a hotel room, he became concerned about his safety and\nwellbeing, as Greenwald began publishing news stories based upon Snowden\u2019s leaked\ndocuments. Wikileaks sent an attorney to help Snowden leave Hong Kong without\nfacing arrest. For several days, the world anxiously waited to see where Snowden would\nreappear. As it happened, he appeared again in Moscow, where the Russian government\ngranted him temporary asylum; he remains there at the time of this writing. Meanwhile,\nthe release of the NSA documents has led to a public debate about the role of security in\nthe face of constitutional rights. Snowden, as well as liberals and Libertarians, argued\nthat the NSA\u2019s SIGINT gathering programs violated U.S. citizen\u2019s rights, as the programs\nallowed for the large data gathering of user\u2019s data on such sites as Google, Yahoo, and\nFacebook. Some companies, such as Facebook, denied their involvement in the NSA\u2019s\nprograms.\nNevertheless, the release of such programs led to worldwide scrutiny, as classified\ndata revealed that the NSA had wiretapped foreign leaders\u2019 phones, including German\nPrime Minister Angela Merkel\u2019s cell phone. The information released by Snowden\nremains controversial and Congress continues to debate the function of the NSA in a\nworld where, increasingly, huge amounts of data related to nearly every U.S. citizen, is\navailable on the internet (Greenwald, 2014).\n213\nDefensive Counterintelligence\nClassification Systems\nOne of the primary ways in which intelligence agencies attempt to keep information out\nof the hands of adversaries is by instituting \nclassification systems\n. \nClassified\ninformation\n is that which is considered sensitive to the point that its distribution is\nlimited to certain people who meet specific requirements and who need the information\nto perform their duties. Each organization develops its own system for classifying\ninformation but in the United States, federal intelligence community agencies must\nadhere to the rules set out in a series of executive orders, the most recent of which was\nissued by President Barack Obama. The three most recognized levels of classification,\nand their respective definitions, are as follows (Bush, 2003):\nTop Secret\n shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of\nwhich reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the\nnational security that the original classification authority is able to identify or\ndescribe.\nSecret\n shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which\nreasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security\nthat the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\nConfidential\n shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of\nwhich reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security\nthat the original classification authority is able to identify or describe.\nAs the definitions make clear, levels of classification are determined by the amount of\ndamage that a release of the information to an adversary could cause. In the case of\nConfidential information, that level is \u201cdamage,\u201d whereas in the case of Top Secret, that\nlevel increases to \u201cexceptionally grave damage.\u201d\nOnce information has been classified, the amount of protection it is afforded depends\non its level of classification. For example, Confidential information may be viewed by\nmany individuals in an organization in many parts of a secure facility. Top Secret\ninformation, on the other hand, may be released to only a very few people who can\naccess it in a highly secure room called a \nSensitive Compartmented Information\nFacility (SCIF)\n that is located within an already secure building.\nAll classified material must be appropriately marked and maintained. There are\nusually instructions that also indicate when it may be released or destroyed and under\nwhat authority it was originally classified.\nAlthough the three levels above are used by all agencies, there are levels of\n214\nclassification that can exist within each. For example, there are many types of\n\u201ccompartments\u201d within the top-secret classification. These are not different \nlevels of\nclassification; rather, they relate to national security issues that are especially sensitive\nand require special handling. This type of information is generally referred to as\nSensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) and is attached to the level of clearance;\nhence, a very sensitive document may be classified at the Top Secret\u2014SCI level.\nFor individuals to view classified information, they must have both a \nright to know\nand a \nneed to know\n that information. Right to know refers to the level of clearance a\nperson has been granted. Clearances follow the naming protocol of classification levels.\nThus, a person may have a Secret or Top Secret clearance along with a particular SCI\ndesignation if appropriate (clearances are rarely granted at the Confidential level). An\nindividual who has been granted a particular level of clearance may view documents at\nthat level and below, provided he or she has a need to know. Therefore, someone with a\nSecret clearance may view documents at the Secret and Confidential levels. Need to\nknow means that persons must have access to that piece of information to perform their\nduties. Thus, someone with a Secret clearance is not permitted to view all Secret\ndocuments; they can view only those for which they have a need to know to carry out\ntheir duties.\nThe commission that investigated the IC\u2019s failure to predict the attacks of 9\u201311\nconcluded that one of the problems that existed was a lack of information sharing\nbetween agencies. To address this, the DNI decided to change the \u201cneed to know\u201d\nrequirement to a \u201cresponsibility to provide.\u201d Although details of this transformation are\nstill under development, the goal is to change culture and agency requirements from\nhaving someone demonstrate that he or she has a need to know information to one in\nwhich an agency has the responsibility to show why information should not be released.\nFor example, the DNI established the following as one of its goals (Director of National\nIntelligence, 2007: 9):\nProvide universal identity access across the Intelligence Community to increase information sharing and\ncollaboration capabilities based on attributes and operational needs.\nThe \u201cresponsibility to provide\u201d standard will be a difficult one to implement. In the first\nplace, agencies are understandably reluctant to give away information that might\ncompromise their \nsources and methods\n, the means by which they gather information.\nAs well, the culture of most IC components involves keeping secrets, not giving them\naway. Changing that mentality will not be easy.\nSecurity Clearances\nOne obtains a right to know classified information by obtaining a \nsecurity clearance\n.\nClearances are not just handed out; a person\u2019s loyalty, maturity, and discretion must first\nbe evaluated; in addition, a person is granted a \nclearance based on the job they will\n215\nperform. To that end, even a highly trusted individual may only be granted a Secret\nclearance because their job requires nothing higher.\nTo evaluate an individual, the agency must perform a \nbackground investigation (BI)\non the job candidate. These investigations may be relatively simple or extremely\ncomplicated. The complexity is generally based on the level of clearance to be granted.\nFor example, a Secret clearance may only require criminal and credit checks, to ensure\nthe individual is not a convicted felon or someone who cannot manage finances. A Top\nSecret clearance, on the other hand, may be quite extensive and involve interviews of\nacquaintances and neighbors as well as polygraph and drug tests.\nEach agency has its own system for conducting BIs. The CIA and other intelligence\nagencies require extensive \npolygraph\n testing for a Top Secret clearance, whereas the\nmilitary does not. The polygraph, often mistakenly referred to as a \u201clie detector,\u201d is a\nmachine that measures changes in a person\u2019s blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and\ngalvanic skin response (sweating); the premise of the machine is that, when people lie,\ntheir bodies display certain physical characteristics, such as an elevated pulse. In fact,\npolygraphers are skilled interviewers who are trained to detect deception. The polygraph\nis a somewhat controversial tool, and there are some who question its validity. For\nexample, CIA spy Aldrich Ames passed two polygraph examinations even as he was\nspying for the Soviet Union. The bigger point here is that agencies are primarily\nconcerned about hiring people who tell the truth. On a typical polygraph, individuals\nwill be asked about minor thievery and drug use. If a person is honest, it will likely not\njeopardize their future employment or the granting of a clearance. However, if the\nperson is caught in a lie, they most assuredly will not be hired.\nThe DNI has established a goal of standardizing security clearances across agencies.\nThis is a work in progress that as of this writing has not been accomplished.\nWhat is involved in a BI? There are several things. For federal agencies, the process is\ngenerally initiated by having an applicant fill out a Standard Form (\nSF)-86\n. This is an\nextensive document in which individuals list prior residences, acquaintances, relatives,\nforeign travel, and credit and criminal history, and provide information about personal\ntopics, such as prior drug use. In addition, a person is usually asked to sign a waiver\nallowing the government to obtain sensitive credit and medical information. The SF-86 is\nused as the basis for conducting the BI. Investigators will visit a person\u2019s old\nneighborhoods and listed contacts, but they will not stop there. Agencies know that a\nperson will only list contacts who will say positive things; investigators also determine\nothers who have not been listed and will question \nthem as well. At a minimum, agencies\nare interested in attributes that can be understood by the acronym CARLA (Character,\nAcquaintances, Responsibility, Loyalty, and Ability).\nIn BIs, investigators try to ascertain information that would predict the likelihood that\nsomeone is already in the service of a foreign government or has the potential of\nbetraying the United States. In large part, BIs focus on circumstances and motivations\nthat have been shown in the past to correlate to spying. For example, many American\nspies have turned to espionage for financial reasons. As a result, background\n216\ninvestigators conduct credit checks and ask questions regarding an applicant\u2019s spending\nhabits to ensure they are not financially reckless or overly extravagant. Still, other U.S.\nspies have had substance abuse problems; consequently, behaviors concerning drugs and\nalcohol are important to discern. Unlike their U.S. counterparts, some famous British\nspies, such as Kim Philby who spied for the Soviet Union, appear to have been motivated\nby ideology; therefore, it is important to understand the degree to which applicants are\nloyal to their country. The CARLA process is based on historical predictors of disloyalty.\nAs mentioned above, some agencies require polygraphs and drug testing. Polygraphs\ncan be relatively restricted, asking only about things such as foreign acquaintances, or\nthey can be extremely intrusive, covering lifestyle topics as well. It depends on the\nagency and the level of clearance that is required.\nOnce a person receives a clearance, they will be constantly scrutinized and required to\nundergo periodic reexaminations. For most agencies, a person faces reexamination every\nfive years. This may also require another poly-graph and drug test.\nAlthough each agency has its own requirements, most seek the same type of\nindividual: someone who is trustworthy, loyal, and responsible. The FBI\u2019s \u201cimmediate\ndisqualifiers\u201d for employment are listed in \nBox 8.2\n.\nBox 8.2\n \nImmediate Disqualifiers for FBI Employment\nConviction of a felony\nUse of illegal drugs in violation of the FBI Employment Drug Policy\nDefault of a student loan (insured by the U.S. Government)\nFailure of an FBI-administered urinalysis drug test\nFailure to register with the Selective Service System (for males only)\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation (n.d.). Background investigation.\nwww.fbijobs.gov/51.asp.\nCounterintelligence Operations\nAll IC agencies have a CI component that seeks to root out spies in their own ranks.\nClearances, compartmentalization, and regular reexaminations are all part of that\nprocess. Balancing security with efficient operations is difficult. One can keep secrets if\nthey never share information; however, it is difficult to get much done if this is the\noverriding ethos. Similarly, an agency can be quite aggressive in its CI mission aimed at\nits own employees. However, that comes at a cost: morale and a concern over one\u2019s\ncareer tend to make individuals \nrisk averse\n\u2014afraid to engage in behavior that might in\nhindsight be seen as dangerous.\nIntelligence work is, by definition, risky. Spies deal with unsavory characters and\n217\noften find themselves in compromising situations. If personnel feel they are not going to\nbe supported by their organization, they may decide not to engage in behavior that has\nthe potential of bearing great fruit. On the other hand, one \u201cloose cannon\u201d can do great\nharm to a country\u2019s intelligence efforts and reputation.\nFrom the 1950s until the mid-1970s, the CIA had a legendary chief of CI named James\nJesus Angleton. Angleton was convinced that Soviet moles had penetrated the CIA, and\nhe took very aggressive action to find them. Angleton\u2019s methods were seen by many as\noverly harsh, leading to the persecution of loyal employees and a sharp drop in morale.\nUpon his departure from the agency in 1975, steps were taken to remediate Angleton\u2019s\nefforts. Ironically, critics charge that the laxity in CI that ensued after Angleton\u2019s\ndeparture may have permitted the activities of double agents, such as Aldrich Ames, to\ngo unnoticed.\n218\nOffensive Counterintelligence\nCatching Spies in the United States\nAt its heart, offensive CI is concerned with damaging the long-term capability of an\nadversary. This can be done in several ways: neutralizing spies, learning about internal\noperations and strategies, and feeding false information.\nAt any given time, thousands of foreign spies operate in the United States hoping to\ngain valuable intelligence. As well, many Americans seem willing to supply sensitive\ninformation to foreign governments in return for money or other favors. Espionage is\none of the oldest crimes punishable under U.S. law. The First Espionage Act was passed\nby Congress on August 21, 1776, making it a crime punishable by death to be discovered\n\u201clurking as spies.\u201d\nThis is not to say that the young nation did not employ its own agents. Nathan Hale,\nwidely considered America\u2019s first spy, was hanged by the British in 1776 after his\ncapture on an intelligence gathering mission.\nInside the United States, the lead counterintelligence agency is the FBI, which ranks\n\u201cprotect[ing] the United States against foreign intelligence operations and espionage\u201d as\nits number two priority, just behind terrorism. It is worth noting that espionage today\ninvolves more than just discovering government secrets. \nEconomic espionage\n, which\nthe FBI describes as \u201c(1) whoever knowingly performs targeting or acquisition of trade\nsecrets to (2) knowingly benefit any foreign government, foreign instrumentality, or\nforeign agent,\u201d costs the United States billions of dollars every year (Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation, n.d.). In 1996, Congress passed the Economic Espionage Act, which made it\na crime to target or acquire trade secrets on behalf of a foreign government or entity.\nIn general, the FBI attempts to identify foreign agents through investigation. Many\nhave historically worked out of embassies, but there are indications this may be\nchanging. For example, in 2010 a group of Russian sleeper agents was discovered living\nquiet, unobtrusive lives in suburban America. They were arrested by the FBI and\nsubsequently deported.\nOnce an agent has been identified, the Bureau generally attempts to turn them into a\ndouble agent\n, someone willing to spy against their own country. Double agents can be\nvery valuable; they often have great insight into the activities of their own agencies and\ncan provide lists of American double agents working for their governments. However,\nmost foreign spies are never successfully \u201cflipped.\u201d Instead, their activities are monitored\nand, should they violate the law, they can be arrested and tried if they lack diplomatic\nimmunity; if they do have immunity, they can be required to leave the country as a\npersona non-grata\n or an \u201cunwelcome person.\u201d\n219\nLike CIA case officers operating overseas, foreign spies in the United States spend a\ngreat deal of time trying to convince Americans to supply them with valuable\ninformation. Not just any American will be targeted; rather, those who possess valuable\ninformation and who appear willing to engage in espionage will be approached. Once\nthe Bureau becomes aware that someone is supplying classified or sensitive information\nto a foreign power, investigation usually begins in earnest. Given the clandestine and\nsurreptitious nature of the crime, counterintelligence investigations can be quite difficult.\nThe targets are often members of IC agencies such as the FBI and CIA, and they are\naware of the investigative techniques that will be used against them.\nIn some cases, it may be too difficult to gather evidence directly; in those instances, a\nfalse flag\n investigation may be initiated. Although \u201cfalse flag\u201d can have many meanings,\nin a law enforcement context it refers to introducing an undercover agent (UCA) posing\nas a representative of a foreign government to the subject; the UCA attempts to convince\nthe subject to continue his spying activities with him. Former FBI Special Agent Earl\nEdwin Pitts, who spied \nfor the Soviet Union and Russia in the 1980s and 1990s, was\napprehended using a false flag technique.\nAs with any undercover operation, the government needs to ensure that it does not\nact so aggressively as to induce the subject to commit an offense that they otherwise\nwould have been unlikely to commit. Dubbed \nentrapment\n, this can be used as a defense\nagainst the crime.\nMost spies who betray their countries and are caught are punished harshly. In the\nUnited States, it is not unusual for a spy to receive life imprisonment. Robert Hanssen\n(\nFigure 8.2\n), for example, was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\nHe was assigned to the Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence, Colorado,\notherwise known as a \u201cSupermax,\u201d where he spends 23 hours per day in solitary\nconfinement; this is \u201chard time\u201d by anyone\u2019s definition.\n220\nFigure 8.2\n \nRobert Hanssen, a notorious spy who revealed many U.S. secrets to the Soviet and Russian security\nservices. (Source: FBI)\nHistorically, the U.S. government has shied away from going to trial in espionage\ncases, fearing that the defense will demand that it release classified material in open\ncourt to prove its case. As a result, many cases have been plea bargained over the years,\nwith the prosecution and defense receiving mutual benefits. To help alleviate this\nproblem, Congress passed the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA) in 1980.\nUnder the Act, judges are permitted to review classified material in secret, alleviating the\nneed to disclose classified intelligence. For more information on CIPA, see \nChapter 10\n(\u201cConstitutional Mandates\u2014Overview of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Roles\u201d). In\nspite of CIPA, or perhaps because of it, plea bargains are still the norm in espionage\ncases.\nThe United States has apprehended many spies over the course of its history (see \nBox\n8.3\n). However, the best and most elusive are still out there, yet to be caught, causing as\nyet undetermined damage. This realization gives security officers many sleepless nights.\nBox 8.3\n \nAmericans WHO have Spied on their Country\nMiss Jenny\n: Spied for the British during the Revolutionary War, reporting\non American and French troop movements.

The CIA, Defense\nIntelligence Agency (DIA), State Department, and military intelligence components all\nengage in CI activities. Even primarily technical agencies, such as the National Security\n222\nAgency (NSA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), have\ncounterintelligence as part of their mission.\nInternational CI missions are both offensive and defensive. Protection of classified\nfacilities and oversight of personnel can be especially difficult overseas. However, there\nis no better place to recruit spies than in a target-rich venue such as a foreign country.\nOne of the principal tasks that case officers have overseas is recruiting spies from\nforeign intelligence services; this is a primary goal of offensive CI. In the same way that\nAldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen devastated American intelligence efforts, over the\nyears, many spies have been recruited from foreign intelligence agencies who have\nlikewise wreaked havoc on their own countries.\nOne of the most famous spies in British and CIA history was Oleg Vladimirovich\nPenkovsky, a colonel in Soviet military intelligence who became a double agent for the\nWest in 1960. Among other things, Penkovsky provided valuable intelligence during the\nCuban Missile Crisis that significantly assisted the United States in its dealings with the\nSoviet Union. His career as \na double agent was short-lived, however. The Soviets\ndiscovered his activities and executed him in 1963. A later spy was KGB (Komitet\nGosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti) Colonel Oleg Antonovich Gordievsky, who worked for\nthe British Secret Intelligence Service from 1974 to 1985. Gordievsky provided\ninformation that averted a potential nuclear crisis between the United States and the\nSoviets.\nDisinformation\nDisinformation is the deliberate spreading of false or inaccurate information to\ndestabilize or confuse an adversary; it can significantly enhance decision advantage.\nDisinformation campaigns and trickery have been staples of counterintelligence and\nforeign policy since antiquity. According to the Bible, Joshua and the Israelites were\ncommanded to destroy all the people of Canaan, of whom the Gibeonites were one.\nHowever, the Gibeonites deceived Joshua by presenting themselves as ambassadors from\na distant, powerful land, thereby sparing themselves. More recently, during the Cold\nWar, the Soviet Union built inflatable decoys to fool overhead satellite surveillance.\nMoreover, in the 1980s, the Soviets embarked on a campaign named Operation\nINFEKTION to convince the world that AIDS resulted from a botched American\nbiowarfare experiment.\nDisinformation can be a double-edged sword, however. It was a mainstay of the FBI\u2019s\nCOINTELPRO (Counterintelligence Program) operation, which spread false information\nabout very sensitive matters, such as marital infidelity. Because it targeted American\ncitizens, COINTELPRO was harshly criticized by the Church Committee, which found\nthat the FBI had been overly aggressive and in some cases operated beyond the law.\n223\nCounterintelligence Operations Today\nDuring the Bush administration, it was decided that intelligence and law enforcement\nefforts were too diffuse. As a result, Congress passed the Counterintelligence\nEnhancement Act of 2002, which created the Office of the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive (NCIX). That office has now been designated the National Counterintelligence\nand Security Center (NCSC) and describes itself as follows (National Counterintelligence\nand Security Center, n.d.):\nThe National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) is part of the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence and is staffed by senior \ncounterintelligence (CI) and other specialists from across the national\nintelligence and security communities. The NCSC develops, coordinates, and produces:\nNational Threat Identification and Prioritization Assessment (NTIPA) and other analytic CI products.\nThe National Counterintelligence Strategy of the United States of America.\nPriorities for CI collection, investigations, and operations.\nCI program budgets and evaluations that reflect strategic priorities.\nIn-depth espionage damage assessments.\nCI awareness, outreach, and training standards policies.\nLike the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence, whether the NCSC will be a success remains to be seen. There are those\nwho applaud its mission of attempting to get agencies to better share information but\nremain skeptical that another layer of bureaucracy will be effective in confronting an\nincreasingly agile, networked adversary.\n224\nConclusion\nCounterintelligence is an important if often overlooked part of maintaining decision\nadvantage. It has both an offensive and defensive component, both of which are essential\nto maintaining appropriate operational security. As intelligence agencies enter the\ntwenty-first century, where transparency and ubiquitous communications are the order\nof the day, it will become increasingly difficult to keep secrets. As such, the role of\ncounterintelligence will only increase in importance. Maintaining an appropriate and\nproper balance between protecting sensitive information and sharing will prove\nespecially challenging. However, the IC really has no choice. It must adapt itself to the\nrealities of the present day and devise new and innovative strategies to successfully\nconfront the future.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nWhich is easier to conduct\u2014offensive counterintelligence or defensive\ncounterintelligence?

The United States has been involved in such actions since the American\nRevolution. Events leading to World War II required the United States to increase its\nintelligence operations, and during the War, the nation built a robust intelligence\ncapability. After the end of World War II, there was much debate over the future role of\nintelligence agencies in the United States. President Harry Truman disbanded the Office\nof Strategic Services (OSS), which lefta void in the nation\u2019s ability to conduct\ninternational covert and clandestine operations.\nIn the absence of an agency with the responsibility for international intelligence, J.\nEdgar Hoover, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), sought the\nmission for his agency. During World War II, the FBI gained much recognition for its\nrole in the arrest and prosecution of Nazi infiltrators smuggled into the United States\nearly in the war. Additionally, the FBI conducted both covert and clandestine operations\nin Central and South America during the War. Hoover\u2019s attempt to assume the\nresponsibility for international intelligence was denied the FBI by President Truman,\nwho was concerned with a mingling of law enforcement and intelligence efforts. He did\nnot want to see a \u201csecret police,\u201d such as the Nazi Gestapo. President Truman also turned\ndown the military\u2019s request to engage in international intelligence. Instead, he believed\nan independent civilian agency was better suited for such a task.\nIn 1946, the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), one of the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s\n(CIA) predecessors, was established. The creation of the CIG marked the beginning of a\nnew relationship between intelligence organizations and Congress. During the debate\nover the National Security Act of 1947, much discussion was devoted to the question of\nwho should supervise intelligence as well as covert operations. The National Security\nAct of 1947 created the CIA and authorized it \u201cto perform such other functions and\nduties related to intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security\nCouncil (NSC) may from time to time direct\u201d (Central Intelligence Agency, 2008).\nWith the establishment of the CIA on September 18, 1947, covert action became a top\npriority. By the end of the 1950s, covert action had evolved to the extent that its purposes\ncould be grouped into three broad categories. Some operations were initiated to\ninfluence the climate of opinion in foreign states, so that they might favor American\nobjectives and democratic values in general. Other operations attempted to influence the\npolitical balance within foreign countries by strengthening the position of some\nindividuals \nand institutions and by weakening those of others. A third category hoped to\nfurther some specific national interest serving U.S. objectives (Isenberg, 1989).\nThroughout the Cold War, the U.S. intelligence community directed most of its efforts\n232\nagainst the Soviet Union and its allies.\nThe United States is not the only nation that conducts covert or clandestine\noperations, and these operations are not new; historically, many nations and their\nleaders have relied on covert action.\nThe nature of covert and clandestine operations typically requires secrecy and often\nthe ability to deny the event. As a result, countless covert, clandestine, and deception\noperations have occurred and are ongoing that will never be publicly revealed.\n233\nCovert Operations\nAccording to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a covert operation is an operation that is planned\nand executed to conceal the identity of, or permit plausible denial by, the sponsor (Joint\nChiefs of Staff, 2010: 81). From this comes the notion of plausible deniability, which\nbasically means that an action cannot be traced back to its source with any degree of\ncertainty. People may suspect that an individual or country is behind some action, but it\ncannot be known for sure. Some means of gaining plausible deniability include having a\nthird party carry out the operation, leaving little physical evidence behind, or otherwise\ndisguising one\u2019s own activities. Plausible deniability has been a cornerstone in the\nfoundation of presidential decisions to authorize covert operations. During the\ninvestigations into what became known as the Iran\u2013Contra Affair, National Security\nAdvisor John Poindexter said \u201cI made a deliberate decision not to ask the President, so\nthat I could insulate him from the decision and provide some future deniability for the\nPresident if it ever leaked out\u201d (Brown University, n.d.).\nCovert actions are used to influence political, military, or economic conditions. They\nare used in situations where secrecy is important, and in situations where the covert\noperation or the result of the operation may not be apparent or acknowledged (even if\nthe effort is successful). As we discuss herein, many consider covert operations as the\nthird option\n, more extreme than diplomacy, but less extreme than direct military action.\nThey are used to some degree by all nations. Even the smallest nations have political\nagendas that may require behind-the-scenes efforts that fall outside traditional\ndiplomacy.\nCovert actions may well involve a wide variety of activities, including propaganda,\nmilitary, or economic efforts to support or disrupt political or military factions within a\nparticular country. They also involve technical and \nlogistical assistance to another\ngovernment to deal with problems within their country or actions undertaken in\nresponse to activities that threaten interests. In extreme cases, these efforts may include\nsuch actions as breaking into a computer network, sabotage, political assassination, or\nregime change. Over the past half century, most covert operations were directly linked to\nthe Cold War and the superpowers\u2019 struggle for control.\nCovert actions, in the truest sense, should complement and supplement parallel overt\nmeasures, such as diplomacy, trade sanctions, or military activities, and they should not\nbe used recklessly. If used correctly and controlled, covert actions or operations may well\nbe a viable third option available to the chief executive when diplomacy has not reached\nits desired goal, and military action is considered extreme.\nThe nature of war and warfare has changed for the United States since the attacks of\nSeptember 11, 2001. Today, more than ever, the nation has called upon its special\noperations assets, both military and civilian, to conduct both covert and clandestine\n234\noperations.\n235\nClandestine Operations\nCovert operations and clandestine operations are distinct. A \nclandestine operation\n is\nsponsored or conducted by governmental departments or agencies in such a way as to\nassure secrecy or concealment (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2010). A clandestine operation\ndiffers from a covert operation in that emphasis is placed on concealment of the\noperation rather than on concealment of the identity of the sponsor. In special\noperations, an activity may be both covert and clandestine and may focus equally on\noperational considerations and intelligence-related activities.\nThroughout the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet military assets conducted clandestine\noperations. Aircraft, submarines, surface ships, and later satellites collected various types\nof materials that fueled the intelligence organizations. In early January 1968, during the\nheight of the Vietnam Conflict, the \nUSS Pueblo\n (AGER-2), a U.S. Naval Ship outfitted to\ncollect electronic transmissions, was stationed in international waters off the coast of\nNorth Korea monitoring that country\u2019s electronic signals. On January 23, 1968, North\nKorean forces attacked and captured the ship, killing one American sailor and taking the\nremaining 82 members of the crew as prisoners. After 11 months in captivity, often\nunder inhumane conditions, \nPueblo\n\u2019s crew was repatriated. Classified materials and\nequipment were onboard the \nPueblo\n, and it is assumed much of the classified material\nwas soon made available to the Soviet Union by the North Koreans. Today, the \nUSS\nPueblo\n is still in the possession of the North Korean government, which maintains the\nship as a tourist attraction.\nU.S. Navy submarines have been used extensively in intelligence gathering missions.\nThis includes gathering information on Soviet missile weapons tests, learning about the\ncapabilities of their ships, collecting electronic signals, and even \u201ctapping\u201d phone lines.\nAn example of a very successful operation where covert operations intersected with\nmilitary operations was \nOperation Ivy Bells\n (see \nBox 4.5\n).\nThe end of the Cold War did not witness the end of clandestine activities. Where a\nvisible U.S. military presence could be considered provocative, the nation has turned to\nclandestine operations. For example, in 2011, the \nNew York Times\n reported that the\nUnited States stepped up clandestine operations inside Somalia, training Somali\nintelligence operatives, interrogating suspects, and sending $45 million in arms to\nAfrican soldiers and private security companies (Gettleman, Mazzetti, & Schmitt, 2011).\nClandestine operations have also been conducted in a law enforcement context in the\nstruggle along the United States\u2013Mexico border. In an operation entitled \nFast and\nFurious\n, weapons from the United States were allowed to pass into the hands of\nsuspected gun smugglers so that the arms could be traced to the higher echelons of\nMexican drug cartels. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, which\nran the operation, lost track of hundreds of firearms, many of which have been linked to\n236\ncrimes, including the fatal shooting of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry in December\n2010. The failure of this operation proved a setback to the efforts of the United States and\nMexico to stem the narco-related violence along the border (Serrano, 2011).\n237\nDeception Operations\nMilitary deception\n is an umbrella term that includes both denial and deception. Denial\nhides the real and deception shows the fake characteristics of an operation. Deception\nmeasures are those designed to mislead the enemy by manipulation, distortion, or\nfalsification of evidence; they are meant to induce adversaries to react in a manner\nprejudicial to their interests (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2010).\nThe U.S. military recognizes the value of deception operations to the extent that an\nentire publication, \nJoint Publication 3\u201313.4 Military Deception\n, is dedicated to the topic.\nMilitary Deception\n emphasizes that to effectively use the art of deception, the deceiver\nmust know and understand the mind of the target of the deception. By understanding\nthe target, the deception can be tailored.\nAccording to \nJoint Publication 3\u201313.4\n, military deception operations include six\nprinciples: focus, objective, centralized planning and control, \nsecurity, timeliness, and\nintegration. These principles are summarized as follows (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006):\nFocus\n\u2014The deception must target the adversary decision-maker capable of\ntaking the desired action(s).\nObjective\n\u2014The deception must cause an adversary to take (or not to take)\nspecific actions, not just to believe certain things.\nCentralized planning and control\n\u2014Operations should be centrally planned and\ndirected to achieve unity of effort.\nSecurity\n\u2014Friendly forces must deny knowledge of a force\u2019s intent to deceive and\nthe execution of that intent to adversaries.\nTimeliness\n\u2014A deception operation requires careful timing.\nIntegration\n\u2014Each military deception must be carefully integrated with the\noperation it is supporting.\nMilitary deception operations apply four basic deception techniques: feints,\ndemonstrations, ruses, and displays. \nFeints\n are offensive actions involving contact with\nthe adversary to deceive him as to the location and/or time of the actual main offensive\naction. \nDemonstrations\n are shows of force where a decision is not sought and no\ncontact with the adversary is intended; a demonstration is intended to cause the\nadversary to select an unfavorable course of action. \nRuses\n deliberately expose false or\nconfusing information for collection and interpretation by the adversary. \nDisplays\n are\nsimulations to convince the adversary that the originating unit possesses certain\ncapabilities, whether they actually do or not (Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2006).\nThere are many examples of both successful and unsuccessful deception operations\nconducted by the United States and its allies. During the American Revolution, George\n238\nWashington used deception measures to offset the superior advantage of the British.\nWashington\u2019s efforts included feeding false and misleading information to the British\nwith the intent of influencing the tactical decisions of their commanders. Washington\u2019s\nuse of deception and misleading information not only misled the British on the strength\nof his Continental forces, but also his tactical intent. During the siege of Yorktown,\nWashington\u2019s use of deception contributed to the ultimate defeat of British General\nCornwallis (Central Intelligence Agency, 2007).\nDuring World War II, a major deception plan was developed to mislead the Germans\nregarding the intended location of the Allied landing on the coast of France in 1944.\nOperation Quicksilver, a subplan of Operation Fortitude, consisted of the \u201ccreation\u201d of a\nfalse Army Group under the command of General George S. Patton. The extent of the\nefforts to convince the Germans that Patton would command the invasion in the Pas-de-\nCalais \narea of Western Europe was so successful that the Germans withheld major\nmilitary forces that could have provided a decisive outcome if they had been unleashed\non the actual invasion in Normandy.\nDuring Operation Desert Storm, U.S. and Coalition forces developed a robust and\neffective deception campaign that contributed to the successful outcome of the war.\nDeception efforts convinced the Iraqi forces that Coalition forces would attack directly\ninto the strength of the Iraqi defenses. As a result, the actual military operations avoided\nthe major Iraqi defenses and quickly achieved victory.\n239\nRecent History of Covert and Clandestine Operations by\nthe United States\nDuring World War II, there was a need for small units of highly trained irregular forces\nthat could operate in enemy-controlled territory. Over a period of five years, the OSS\nconducted a wide range of operations and laid the foundation for today\u2019s CIA and the\nnation\u2019s intelligence and Special Operations communities. World War II witnessed an\nexplosion of covert operations by nations around the world, and the United States was\nno exception. Military Intelligence worked to gain or break enemy communications\ncodes. The story of ULTRA and breaking the Japanese Navy\u2019s \u201cPurple Code,\u201d described\nin \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d), significantly contributed to\nthe U.S. naval victory over Japan in the Battle of Midway Island in 1942.\nThe rise of popular resistance movements to oppose the Germans and Japanese\nbrought demands for external assistance and led to the OSS working with guerrilla\nmovements. The ability of these \u201cundergrounds\u201d to conduct systematic activities behind\nenemy lines, including both simple espionage and more forceful sabotage and ambush,\naffirmed the notion that a \u201cfifth column\u201d could function; this paved the way for postwar\n\u201cstay-behind networks\u201d intended to replicate the functions of the World War II\nresistance. At the same time, the ability to supplement resistance activities with supplies\nand teams of specialists from the outside, and reinforce their actions with carefully\ntargeted commando raids, added to the value of their efforts. These missions were well\nsuited for the OSS and Great Britain\u2019s Special Operations Executive.\nMilitary units also conducted extensive covert operations during the war. For\nexample, the United States submarines \nUSS Argonaut\n and \nUSS Nautilus\n delivered\nMarines of the 2nd Raider Battalion to Makin Atoll for the purpose of conducting a raid\n(Haughey, 2001). Submarines were also used for a \nwide variety of missions throughout\nthe war including evacuation of people behind the enemy lines, moving gold and silver\nfrom the Philippines and conducting reconnaissance missions.\nWith the conclusion of World War II, the United States found itself as one of only two\nglobal superpowers and the self-proclaimed leader of the Western World. Western\nleaders identified the Soviet Union and the spread of Communism as the major threat\nfaced by the free world. Although the two superpowers prepared for a major military\nconflict, the nations and their allies engaged in extensive covert and clandestine\noperations, the majority of which were intended to undermine the influence of the other\nnation.\nCollecting intelligence on the Soviet Union became a top priority for the United States.\nOpen sources reveal extensive United States\u2013backed covert and clandestine operations in\nthe post\u2013World War II period. In 1946, the United States backed successful efforts in\nGreece to overthrow the Metaxas government and supported anti-Communist forces in\n240\nthe Greek civil war in an attempt to limit the Communist influence. Soon after its\nfounding in 1947, the CIA became involved in covert operations. In the 1948 Italian\nelections, it appeared that the Communist Party had a good chance of prevailing. As the\nelections drew closer, both the United States and the Soviet Union contributed increasing\namounts of money and other support to their respective candidates. In the end, the\nUnited States\u2013backed Christian Democrat party won; the CIA celebrated an early\nvictory.\nThroughout the Cold War era, covert and clandestine operations continued and\nevolved. In addition to secretly funding friendly candidates and governments, such\nunfriendly actions as deposing leaders and even assassinating them were attempted and\ncarried out. Recall from \nChapter 2\n that, in 1953, the CIA helped overthrow the popularly\nelected Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammed Mosaddeq, who threatened to nationalize\nthat country\u2019s oil companies. The overthrow of Mosaddeq and what followed provides a\nfascinating case study for debating the merits of covert operations (see \nBox 9.1\n).\nOther covert operations included the 1954 overthrow of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala,\nthe attempts throughout the 1960s to assassinate Fidel Castro in Cuba, the 1963\noverthrow of Juan Bosch in the Dominican Republic, the overthrow and assassination of\nNgo Dinh Diem in South Vietnam, and the overthrow of the government of Carlo Julio\nArosemena in Equador.\nOther similar operations included the United States\u2013supported operations to defeat\nrebel forces loyal to Patrice Lumumba in the Congo in 1964, the 1965 propaganda\ncampaign to overthrow the Sukarno government in Indonesia, the 1967 provision of aid\nto overthrow George Papandreou and install \nGeorge Papadopoulous in Greece, and\ninvolvement in the 1970 overthrow of Norodom Sihanouk in Cambodia (Isenberg, 1989).\nBox 9.1\n \nDilemma of Covert Operations: The Iranian\nExample\nIn \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of the United States Intelligence Community\u201d), we described\nthe 1953 coup engineered by the CIA that overthrew the popularly elected Prime\nMinister of Iran, Mohammed Mosaddeq. What was Mosaddeq\u2019s sin? He threatened\nto nationalize the oil companies inside that country that belonged to Britain.\nMosaddeq\u2019s successor, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was a friend to the United States\nbut was brutal to his own people. In 1979, Pahlavi was himself deposed by an angry\ncitizenry that resented both him and his supporters in the United States. His regime\nwas replaced by a theocracy that rules to this day\u2014one that remains a bitter enemy\nof the United States.\nDid the coup of 1953 set in motion a chain of events that was destined to end\nbadly for the United States? Should the engineers of the coup have foreseen where\nthe unintended consequences of their adventures could lead? Or was it beyond\nanybody\u2019s ability to forecast what might have happened?\n241\nProponents of the original coup point to the fact that the United States enjoyed a\nloyal ally in the Middle East for many years\u2014one that assisted in significant ways\nduring the Cold War in the struggle against the Soviets. They further argue that 26\nyears is an eternity in the diplomatic relations of the troubled Middle East; trying to\nguess where things might have ended up in the late 1970s was an impossibility in\nthe 1950s.\nOn the other hand, critics of covert activities would no doubt argue that such\nactions always leave a bitter taste for the ones negatively affected by the action, in\nthis case the Iranian people. When coupled with continued U.S. support for the\nbrutal Pahlavi regime, it was only a matter of time before new leadership would\nrise up; it was further inevitable that they would blame the United States for their\nwoes. Even if the exact chain of events could not be predicted, the fact that\nsomething negative would emerge was likely.\nOne of the crucial confrontations of the Cold War was the Vietnam War. In addition\nto what occurred on the battlefield, the behind-the-scenes covert war grew in intensity,\nboth internationally and domestically. As described in \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of the United\nStates Intelligence Community\u201d), the CIA carried out Operation CHAOS, and the FBI\ndramatically expanded its COINTELPRO program; both were subsequently judged by\nthe Church and Pike Committees to have contained illegal elements. In addition, the CIA\noperated its Phoenix Program in Vietnam in conjunction with the military. Much\nremains classified about this program; its proponents credit it with eliminating much of\nthe threat of the Viet Cong insurgency, whereas its critics charge that it was little more\nthan an assassination initiative that grossly violated international law.\nVietnam was by no means the only sustained target of covert activities during the\nCold War. Even after the failed Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, Cuba\nremained a major focus of the CIA\u2019s efforts. It initiated \nOperation Mongoose\n, which\nincluded planned sabotage and assassinations; insofar as the Castro regime and its\nremnants remain in power, these operations cannot have been considered successes.\nOne of the more recent attempts at covert operations, and one which threatened to\ndestroy a presidency, occurred during the administration of Ronald Reagan. In the early\n1980s, Reagan, a staunch anti-Communist, wanted to support a rebel movement in\nNicaragua known as the Contras who were battling the pro-Soviet Sandinista\ngovernment. The President ordered the CIA to support the Contras, but in 1983,\nCongress ordered an end to all funding. Undeterred, personnel in the NSC devised a\nscheme to covertly provide the Contras with funds without alerting Congress.\nIn an unrelated matter, the administration had been attempting to curry favor with\nthe government of Iran by secretly selling them weapons;, the administration hoped that\nIran would use its influence to free six Americans who had been kidnapped by the\nterrorist group Hezbollah. The administration took the profits it obtained from these\narms sales and provided some of them to the Contras. When Congress learned of this\n242\nscheme to subvert its laws, it was understandably incensed. At first, the President denied\nthat the arm sales to Iran constituted an \u201carms for hostage\u201d deal; however, eventually he\nhad to admit that, indeed, this is exactly what happened. Several investigations were\nundertaken. In the end, 14 administration officials were charged and 11 were convicted\nof crimes; they all received pardons from President George H. W. Bush just before he\nleftthe presidency (Walsh, 1994).\n243\nMilitary Covert Operations\nThroughout the history of the United States, the nation\u2019s focus on military capabilities\ncentered on developing and sustaining traditional forces. During the post\u2013World War II\nperiod, the United States reevaluated its military needs and required capabilities. The\nradical demobilization at the end of World War II and the new challenges of the Cold\nWar led to, although often slowly, a revolution in military thought. One of the ideas\nadvanced during this period was the development of various capabilities within the\nmilitary to conduct nontraditional or special operations. The different branches of\nservice embraced the idea of special operations with various levels of enthusiasm. The\nU.S. Navy developed the now-famous Navy SEALS, and the Army reactivated the\nRangers of World War II, the Special Forces, and later the Delta Force.\nThroughout the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union conducted\nextensive covert operations. Commencing early in the period, the United States\nestablished listening stations and conducted extensive flights into Soviet airspace,\ninitially with conventional military aircraft, later with specially developed aircraft,\nsatellites, and even high-altitude balloons. By the late 1940s, the United States used\nmodified bombers to try to penetrate the Soviet Union and its satellite states. Between\n1951 and 1956, Presidents Truman and Eisenhower and Prime Minister Churchill\nperiodically, and on a case-by-case basis, authorized military overflights of the USSR and\nother \u201cdenied territory.\u201d\nAs the needs for surveillance increased, new aircraft, including the U-2 and the SR-71,\nwere developed. Beginning in 1956, the CIA commenced U-2 overflights from West\nGermany over the Soviet Union. Soviet overflights were not without cost. Through the\nend of April 1960, there had been 23 successful U-2 overflights of Soviet territory. In\n1960, a U-2, piloted by Frances Gary Powers, was shot down over the Soviet Union. U-2\nflights were also used to gather information on the activities in Cuba (Richelson, 2002).\n244\nLegal Requirements Upon the President to Report\nIntelligence Operations\nThe Rockefeller Commission report and the later Church committee hearing included a\ncomprehensive public charter, Executive Order 11905, issued by President Gerald Ford\non February 18, 1978. This charter provided a new command structure for foreign\nintelligence agencies, forbade peacetime assassinations, required the CIA\u2019s Inspector\nGeneral and legal office to be upgraded and become involved in the internal oversight\nprocess, and created a standing Senate committee on intelligence (Isenberg, 1989).\nThe President of the United States is required by 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 413(a)(1) to \u201censure that\nthe congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the\nintelligence activities of the United States.\u201d However, under 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 413b(c)(2), the\nPresident may elect to report instead to the \nGang of Eight\n when he thinks \u201cit is essential\nto limit access\u201d to information about a covert action.\nThe Gang of Eight is a common colloquial term for a set of eight leaders within the\nUnited States Congress. Specifically, the Gang of Eight includes the leaders of each of the\ntwo parties from both the Senate and House of Representatives, and the chairs and\nranking minority members of both the Senate Committee and House Committee for\nintelligence.\nChapter 10\n (\u201cConstitutional Mandates\u2014Overview of Executive, Legislative, and\nJudicial Roles\u201d) discusses the laws concerning covert activities in greater detail.\n245\nCovert Operations and the War on Terror\nAs we discussed at the outset of this chapter, it is impossible to document fully covert\nactivities because, by their nature, they are classified. Even for those that are eventually\nrevealed, it often takes years for the facts to see the light of day. To that end, we make\nno claim that this section of the chapter will be complete\u2014to be sure, much is going on\nof which we are unaware.\nThat said, some facts have been revealed. On October 25, 2001, six weeks after the 9/11\nattacks, then-President Bush issued \nNational Security Presidential Directive (NSPD)\n9\n, which was titled \u201cCombating Terrorism.\u201d Although the directive itself remains\nclassified, in 2004, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld gave testimony before the 9/11\nCommission in which he outlined its major points. The directive orders the destruction\nof al Qa\u2019ida, using all elements of national power as necessary\u2014diplomatic, military,\neconomic, intelligence, information, and law enforcement (Federation of American\nScientists, n.d.).\nIn essence, \nNSPD 9\n announced that the United States would aggressively pursue\nterrorists and those who supported them; covert operations would be one arrow in the\nquiver. Since that time, numerous covert activities, some conducted by the military and\nsome by the civilian intelligence community (IC), have been carried out.\nOne of the covert tools that has been used since at least the mid-1990s is\nextraordinary rendition\n (according to former counterterrorism official Richard Clarke,\nthe quote at the beginning of the chapter allegedly comes from a debate on the tactic\nduring the Clinton presidency). The practice itself involves the abduction of individuals,\nusually clandestinely, and their transfer to countries other than the United States, such as\nLibya and Saudi Arabia. Critics contend that this is a way for the U.S. government to\ncircumvent laws against torture by transferring individuals to countries where such\nbehavior is tolerated. Once the abducted individual has been \u201cdebriefed,\u201d the \nfruits of the\ninterrogation can be transferred to the United States. The Obama administration\ncontinued the policy of extraordinary rendition, but claimed to have modified it by\ntransferring prisoners only to countries that agreed to treat them \u201chumanely\u201d (Wang,\n2011).\nAlthough official word on rendition remains scarce, from time to time some\ninformation does surface. One example illustrates that even U.S. allies are not altogether\ncomfortable with the program. On February 23, 2003, Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, a\nsuspected terrorist, was abducted off the streets of Milan, Italy. He was allegedly flown\nto Egypt where he claims to have been tortured for three years. Upon his release,\nincensed Italian judicial officials began an investigation. Ultimately, 26 CIA officials and\nsome members of the Italian intelligence service were indicted in the matter; some CIA\nofficers have been found guilty \nin absentia\n (Mazzetti & Shane, 2008).\n246\nAnother controversial tactic that has been carried out includes the use of \nunmanned\naerial vehicles\n to locate, watch, and occasionally kill high value targets (\nFigure 9.1\n).\nSome of the attacks have come over the battlefield in Afghanistan but many occur in\ncountries where America is not at war, such as Pakistan and Yemen. The program itself\nhas been highly successful; many senior al Qa\u2019ida officials have been killed. However,\nthese strikes have also killed civilians and angered many in the Arab world, who see\nthem as invasions of sovereign airspace.\nFigure 9.1\n \nThe Air Force\u2019s MQ-9 Reaper is a multimedia platform that includes infrared sensors, a\ncolor/monochrome daylight TV camera, an image-intensified TV camera, a laser range finder /designator,\nand a laser illuminator. In addition, it can carry sophisticated weaponry, such as the laser-guided AGM-114\nHellfire missile. (Source: U.S. Air Force)\nPerhaps the most significant covert operation since the 9/11 attacks was the killing of\nOsama bin Laden in Pakistan in May 2011 (see \nFigure 9.2\n). The operation itself, described\nin detail in \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d), was \na joint operation between IC agencies and\nthe military. It demonstrated how, by working together, the strengths of different arms\nof the U.S. government could achieve a significant outcome.\nFigure 9.2\n At the time of his death, bin Laden was the most hunted fugitive in the world. While the raid to\ncapture him was carried out by Navy SEALs, many elements of the IC collaborated to track him down.\n(Source: FBI)\n247\nAre Covert Operations a Good Idea?\nCovert operations are among the most controversial activities carried out by the IC.\nThose who favor them claim that they provide the Executive Branch with an essential\n\u201cthird option\u201d between diplomacy and military action. According to proponents, in\ntoday\u2019s increasingly complex and turbulent world, covert options need to remain\navailable, especially against non-state actors such as terrorists.\nCritics disagree. For example, David Isenberg points out that, since World War II, the\nsuccess of U.S. covert operations has been exaggerated. Some operations, such as the Bay\nof Pigs, were outright fiascoes. Other operations, such as the Iranian coup of 1953, which\nwere once acclaimed successes, lefta legacy of anti-Americanism that continues to\nhamper the conduct of our foreign policy. Moreover, because such operations have\nalmost always become public\u2014Nicaragua being an obvious example\u2014debates over their\nlegitimacy have fostered considerable domestic divisiveness. Paramilitary operations\u2014\nwhich can be more accurately described as secret wars, the most extreme form of covert\naction\u2014have resulted in countless deaths and immense destruction (Isenberg, 1989). \nBox\n9.1\n describes the dilemma inherent in covert operations.\n248\nConclusion\nThe United States remains involved in covert and clandestine operations. Such\noperations have existed since the founding of the nation and continue during modern\ntimes. Proponents of covert operations maintain that such operations are essential to\nmaintain national security and for the long-term survival of the nation. These operations\nare resources through which direct war may be avoided, thereby diminishing the costs of\ninternational confrontations.\nA covert operation is an operation that is so planned and executed as to conceal the\nidentity of or permit plausible denial by the sponsor. Covert operations frequently use\nsabotage, propaganda, paramilitary, and political actions; when they go according to\nplan, the operations succeed with a minimum of fuss, bloodshed, and time expended. A\nclandestine operation is an operation sponsored or conducted by governmental\ndepartments or agencies in such a way as to assure secrecy or concealment. A\nclandestine operation differs from a covert operation in that emphasis is placed on\nconcealment of the operation rather than on concealment of the identity of the sponsor.\nIn special operations, an activity may be both covert and clandestine and may focus\nequally on operational considerations and intelligence-related activities. Deception\nmeasures are those measures designed to mislead the enemy by manipulation, distortion,\nor falsification of evidence to induce them to react in a manner prejudicial to their\ninterests.\nSuch operations have been sponsored by both the United States and its allies.\nFurthermore, such operations have been directed against the United States and its allies.\nThese continuous activities comprise an international game of secrecy whose activities\nare often unknown by the citizens of both sponsoring and targeted nations and remain\nunacknowledged.\nThe relevancy and potency of such activities cannot be overstated. Covert operations\nhelped the Allied forces achieve victory during World War II. The Cold War also\nmanifested numerous operations that were sponsored by both sides in hopes of gaining\nan advantage. Today, the fight against terrorism is being waged on many different\nfronts; covert operations play a huge role in the battle plan.\nThe impacts of such operations are tremendous. Proponents claim that they contribute\ntoward strategic advantage for the United States and its allies. Using such operations\nprovides America with the capability of deterring direct war and positioning itself for\nfuture benefits. When successful, such activities contribute toward the maintaining of\nnational security, national sovereignty, and the safety of the American public. Critics\nmaintain that they undermine American credibility on the world stage, produce\nunintended consequences, and are often unsuccessful. Regardless of the debate, it is\ndoubtful the United States will forgo covert operations in the near or medium-term\n249\nfuture.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nOne section of this chapter asks whether, in the long term, covert operations\nhave helped or hurt U.S. interests. What do you think? Why?\n2\n. \nIf you were the President of the United States, what sort of covert operations\nwould you permit? Which ones would you forbid? Under what circumstances\nwould you allow covert operations to be conducted?\n3\n. \nSome have argued that covert operations should be carried out exclusively by\nthe military. Do you agree with that?\n4\n. \nPlausible deniability is one attribute of a successful covert operation. In your\nview, what are some other attributes that make an operation successful or\nunsuccessful?\n250\nKey Terms\nCentralized planning and control\nClandestine operation\nDeception operations\nDemonstrations\\\nDisplays\nExtraordinary rendition\nFast and Furious\nFeint\nFocus\nGang of Eight\nIntegration\nMilitary deception\nNational Security Presidential Directive (NSPD) 9\nObjective\nOperation Mongoose\nRuses\nSecurity\nThird option\nTimeliness\nUnmanned aerial vehicles\nUSS Pueblo\n251\nReferences\nBrown University.

On the one hand, democracy\nsuggests openness and governmental accountability to the people. For much of early\nAmerican history, U.S. presidents hesitated to establish a peacetime intelligence agency,\nthinking that such a structure held the potential of becoming a state-controlled police\nunit, reminiscent of the Nazis.\nIntelligence, by its very nature, is secret, and secrecy is arguably the antithesis of\ndemocracy. Intelligence agencies, however, must maintain secrecy to keep the United\nStates safe. If the United States faces a threat, it is easier for the IC to handle such a\nthreat clandestinely. If troops are placed in battle, it is important that military strategy\nand troop formation is not revealed to the enemy. If an intelligence agency receives a\nthreat aimed at U.S. persons, the agency must often respond without revealing the threat\nit faces. How does secrecy exist within a democracy? Intelligence and national security\nlaws are structured to strike the difficult balance between maintaining democracy while\nalso allowing for agencies to respond to threats according the nation\u2019s needs.\nDespite the many laws enacted to protect civil liberties, some argue that intelligence\nstill impedes on people\u2019s constitutional rights. The American Civil Liberties Union\n(ACLU) argues that intelligence can threaten people\u2019s \nFirst Amendment\n right to\nfreedom of speech and their \nFourth Amendment\n right to be free from search and\nseizure (\nFigure 10.1\n). In turn, the ACLU argues that strict laws do not enhance security\nbut rather make a mockery of the Bill of Rights. The ACLU explains:\nMore exacting standards are necessary in national security cases because history has repeatedly shown that\ngovernment leaders too easily mistake threats to their political security for threats to the national security \u2026\nStifling dissent does not enhance security. (ACLU, 2009)\nThe U.S. IC is, first and foremost, governed by the Constitution and other applicable\nlaws. Before assessing the legal underpinnings governing the IC, it is important to\nunderstand first the legal structure within which it operates. Each branch of government\nlegally has authority to perform certain functions related to intelligence and national\nsecurity.\n255\nFigure 10.1\n The original Bill of Rights, which is displayed in the Rotunda of the U. S. Capitol. (Source:\nNational Archives)\nUnder Article II of the Constitution, the \nExecutive Branch\n (composed of the\nPresident, the Vice-President, and executive departments) has the power to make\ndecisions related to the country\u2019s security (U.S. Constitution, \nArticle 2). The President, as\nCommander-in-Chief, may authorize military action as a defensive measure. Each\npresident, in their oath of office, swears to \u201cpreserve, protect, and defend the\nConstitution.\u201d Collectively, these duties establish the executive\u2019s predominance in\nforeign affairs and national defense.\nThe \nLegislative Branch\n, consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives,\nhas the authority to declare war, oversee the military, conduct hearings, and control the\nfederal budget. Throughout the existence of the U.S. IC, Congress has played an\nimportant role in intelligence lawmaking and oversight (Ford, 2007). The \nJudicial\nBranch\n, led by the Supreme Court, interprets the laws that the legislature creates. Over\nthe years, various courts have issued important decisions regarding intelligence.\nThese various roles provide \nchecks and balances\n. This is an important concept to\ngrasp when attempting to understand the legal structure of the IC. The government\n256\ncannot do whatever it pleases when collecting intelligence. Instead, it must operate\nwithin its constitutionally assigned duties. Laws related to intelligence stretch across a\nmyriad of legal areas from the First Amendment right to free speech to the Fourth\nAmendment\u2019s protection from search and seizure to even the occasional lawsuit against\nintelligence agencies. Throughout the history of the IC, the laws have evolved sometimes\nin nuanced ways, at other times in ways that are drastic and unprecedented. Often, new\nlaws reflect much-needed change. Perhaps prior laws were poorly written or incomplete,\nor certain events demonstrated a great need for a law where one did not previously exist.\nFor example, new communication technologies have necessitated enhanced laws related\nto signals intelligence.\n257\nLegal Origin of the Intelligence Community\nThe National Security Act of 1947 legally constructed the United States\u2019 first permanent,\npeacetime intelligence organization, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). After World\nWar II, the United States found itself in a challenging position. During the twentieth\ncentury, the country had used its involvement in two World Wars to gain hegemonic\nstatus and abandon its previous precedent of isolationism. No longer would the United\nStates refrain from participating in international affairs. Rather, it would play a\nsubstantial role in establishing such organizations as the United Nations, the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, and the World Bank. Furthermore, the world experienced\nrapid technological innovation and increased warfare capability. The United States\nsuccessfully developed nuclear fission and \nthe atomic bomb, thereby raising the\ndestructive stakes of warfare exponentially. Europe, meanwhile, lay in ruins while the\nSoviet Union loomed large, and governments across the world appeared susceptible to\ncommunist influence. After emerging victorious from World War II, the United States\nrefocused its defense agenda on the Cold War, necessitating a need for enhanced\nintelligence and military organizations. Unfortunately, the United States also faced an\nenormous hurdle: how could it legally adapt its antiquated pre\u2013World War II defense\nstructure to successfully counter Cold War challenges?\nDuring World War II, Major General William Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic\nServices, proposed\u2014in a document subsequently referred to as the \u201cDonovan Plan\u201d\u2014the\ncreation of the first permanent intelligence agency led by a central director directly\nsupervised by the President. Based primarily on the British intelligence model, Donovan\nalso proposed the creation of an Advisory Board consisting of the Secretary of State, the\nSecretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, and other members whom the president\nwished to appoint. His proposal would ultimately influence the content of the National\nSecurity Act of 1947 and creation of the CIA.\nIn 1945, Congress\u2019s Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack\nacknowledged that \u201coperational and intelligence work requires centralization of\nauthority and clear-cut allocation of responsibility.\u201d The report found that the Navy and\nWar Departments\u2019 lack of coordination led to intelligence failures resulting in the Pearl\nHarbor attack. Although Congress agreed that the U.S. military and intelligence\ncommunities merited restructuring, the question was exactly \nhow\n to organize them. One\nof the biggest hurdles facing the creation of an independent intelligence agency was the\nmilitary\u2019s unwillingness to relinquish control. In \nThe Central Intelligence Agency,\nHistory and Documents\n, Williams Leary writes:\n[I]t was clear from the outset that neither separate service departments nor a single department of National\nDefense would willingly resign its intelligence function and accompanying personnel and budgetary allotments\nto a new central agency. (Leary, 1984)\n258\nIn 1946, President Truman sent a letter to the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War,\nand the Secretary of the Navy establishing the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the\nposition of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and the National Intelligence\nAuthority council. His letter defined the CIG\u2019s role to include correlating and evaluating\nintelligence related to national security and planning for the coordination of intelligence\nactivities within the Departments of War and Navy. Truman explicitly prohibited CIG\nfrom \nacquiring any law enforcement functions. The CIG would prove, however, to be\nshort-lived.\nIn 1947, Congress did away with the CIG when it passed the National Security Act of\n1947, creating the first legal basis for a permanent U.S. intelligence agency and\nrestructuring the military. Replacing the CIG, the Act established the CIA as the primary\ngovernment agency to receive and interpret intelligence from all sources (referred to as\n\u201call source intelligence\u201d). The Act endowed the CIA with four primary functions:\nCollect intelligence through human sources and by other appropriate means.\nCorrelate, evaluate, and disseminate intelligence related to the national security\nand provide appropriate dissemination of such intelligence.\nProvide overall direction for and coordination of the collection of intelligence\noutside the United States by human sources.\nPerform other functions and duties related to intelligence affecting the national\nsecurity as the President or the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) may\ndirect.\nThe Act also created a National Security Council composed of the President, Vice-\nPresident, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and others. To this day, the Council\nadvises the President on issues related to the integration of domestic, foreign, and\nmilitary policies.\nFinally, the National Security Act of 1947 restructured the military by replacing the\nDepartment of War with the Department of Defense and placing a Secretary of Defense\nin charge of the entire military. Ultimately, the Act served as a compromise between\npeople who advocated for stronger centralization of the military and those who opposed\nincreased control.\nSince its inception, the key provision in the National Security Act of 1947 that\ncontinues to arise in legal settings is the CIA\u2019s fourth mandate to perform \u201cother\nfunctions and duties relating to intelligence affecting the national security as the\nPresident or DCI may direct.\u201d Throughout history, Presidents have used this vague\nphrase to justify their authorization of power when faced with national security threats.\n259\nIntelligence and International Law\nHow does intelligence function in relation to international law? We know that countries\nengage in forms of espionage against other nation-states as well as groups of people or\nindividuals, but are these actions legal? Glenn Sulmasy, an international law scholar,\nstates:\nCaptured spies derive no \u201crights\u201d to legally defend their actions, other than those they may acquire through the\ndomestic legal system of the state that \nhas captured them. But this does not mean that intelligence gathering\nviolates international law \u2026 [P]eacetime intelligence gathering \u201cis not considered wrong morally, politically, or\nlegally.\u201d (Sulmasy & Yoo, 2007)\nIntelligence gathering does not violate international law. International law does not\nexplicitly prohibit espionage activities because oftentimes intelligence gathering stands\nin the way of otherwise aggressive encounters between states. As long as states can\ncollect information relevant and necessary to their security, they may delay their urge to\nresort to armed conflict.\n260\nTargeting and Assassination\nOne of the most salient issues regarding intelligence law today centers around\nassassinations and targeted killings. The IC and military\u2019s use of drones has elicited\nmuch discussion among legal scholars as well as the general public regarding what\nconstitutes a lawful killing (Lapidos, 2009). Intelligence agencies have hatched their share\nof assassination plots. Between 1960 and 1965, the United States tried at least eight times\nto assassinate Fidel Castro.\nIn November 1975, the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations (Church\nCommittee) recommended an end to political assassinations after discovering that the\nCIA had attempted to end the lives of several leaders including Fidel Castro and Patrice\nLumumba, the Premiere of the Congo (Canestaro, 2003). The agency had indirectly\nsupported coups that brought about the deaths of Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican\nRepublic, Ngo Dihn Diem of South Vietnam, and Rene Schneider of Chile (Canestaro,\n2003). For more information on the IC\u2019s involvement in covert operations, see \nChapter 9\n(\u201cCovert Operations\u201d). In response to these findings, the Church Committee requested\nthat the United States reject the government\u2019s use of assassination as a means to further\nits foreign policy.\nIn 1976, President Ford issued Executive Order 11905, which included a section\nentitled \u201cRestrictions on Intelligence Activities.\u201d The order prohibited political\nassassination, stating, \u201cNo employee of the United States Government shall engage in, or\nconspire to engage in, political assassination\u201d (Executive Order 11905 on U.S. Foreign\nIntelligence Activities, February 18, 1976). Since Ford\u2019s issuance of an executive order\nrestricting assassinations, every President has upheld the restrictions, with President\nReagan providing the most recent reiteration of an assassination ban through Executive\nOrder 12333. Despite all recent Presidents\u2019 upholding of Executive Order 12333, they\nhave simultaneously authorized the lawful killing of combatants and terrorists. Even\nafter Reagan signed into order 12333, he authorized attacks \nagainst three targets in Libya\nin retaliation for a Libyan terrorist attack at a Berlin nightclub that killed a U.S. Marine.\nOne of the targets, El Azziziya Barracks, served as a home to Libyan leader Muammar\nQadhafi (Canestaro, 2003). Reagan justified the attacks in light of Executive Order 12333\nby denying that Qadhafiwas a target of the attacks. He explained, \u201cWe weren\u2019t out to kill\nanybody\u201d (Canestaro, 2003). In a play on words, White House counsel Abraham D.\nSofaer argued that the attacks did not violate order 12333; because Qadhafiwas not a\ntarget of the raids, his death would be a consequence of an attack but would not rise to\nthe level of assassination since the United States lacked any intent to assassinate him.\nDespite Executive Order 12333, the ban does not apply in wartime situations when the\nmilitary is striking the enemy\u2019s command and control or leadership targets (Woodward,\n2001). Furthermore, the United States can, in the interest of self-defense, attack terrorists\n261\nor other leaders planning attacks against U.S. interests. Executive orders allow for a great\ndeal of flexibility by the President. Legal scholar and CIA employee Nathan Canestaro\nexplains:\nAlthough each order has the effect of law, they are not immutable, and allow the President a variety of ways to\ncircumvent them. The President has the authority to overrule the order, make an exception to it, or ask Congress\nto legislate its removal. (Canestaro, 2003)\nThus, Executive Order 12333 did not fully ban assassinations by the United States against\nother political leaders and foes, but rather stopped \u201cunilateral\u201d actions by government\nofficials and \u201c[guaranteed] that the authority to order assassinations lies with the\nPresident alone\u201d (Canestaro, 2003).\nAfter the September 11, 2001 attacks, Congress passed a resolution known as the\nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF)\n to \u201cauthorize\nthe use of U.S. Armed Forces against those responsible for the recent attacks launched\nagainst the United States against those who helped carry out the September 11, 2001\nattacks\u201d (Public Law 107\u201340, September 18, 2001). The act allowed the U.S. military to\nuse force against al Qa\u2019ida in keeping with the \nGeneva Convention\n, which allows one\nuniformed soldier to kill another uniformed soldier. In keeping with the flexibility of EO\n12333, President Bush also issued an intelligence finding to allow for the CIA to target\nmembers of al Qa\u2019ida, \u201cexplicitly calling for the destruction of Osama bin Laden and his\nworldwide al Qa\u2019ida network\u201d (Woodward, 2001).\nThe military and CIA-led drone attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, and\nYemen have led to recent legal debates. America first weaponized drones in October 2001\nwhile searching for bin Laden. Since that time, two attitudes have emerged regarding the\nuse of drones. On the one hand, \nsome see them as extremely effective devices capable of\ntaking out America\u2019s most dangerous enemies with the added benefit of not posing any\nimmediate risks to U.S. soldiers. The drones are unmanned and flown by pilots who may\nbe thousands of miles away. If drones are shot down or crash, they pose no threat to a\npilot\u2019s life. Furthermore, drones have an incredible ability to capture details on the\nground. They have cameras capable of processing extreme details to identify human\ntargets. The government has insisted on a zero-tolerance policy for civilian deaths; most\nrecently, former General Stanley McChrystal took a hard line on this (O\u2019Connell, 2010).\nDespite the government\u2019s insistence that drones do not intentionally kill civilians,\nopponents still view them as scary science fiction devices that dis-mantle native\npopulations\u2019 regard for the United States while needlessly killing thousands of innocents.\nThe information regarding the deaths of civilians is mostly classified, so it is impossible\nat this point to verify through government statistics exactly how many have died\nthrough the use of drones (Fair, 2010). Other critics have also taken issue with the fact\nthat drones are used outside warzones in such countries as Pakistan, Somalia, and\nYemen. Opponents of drones state that the machines cannot lawfully be used outside\ncombat zones; rather, they argue that these threats should be handled by law\nenforcement authorities. Proponents of drones, on the other hand, have argued the\n262\nAUMF did not specify a particular country as the area of a warzone, but rather it\nauthorized force against any nations, organizations, or persons who assisted with the\n9/11 attacks. During his time in office, President Obama greatly expanded the use of\ndrones to fight terrorists. The use of drones against American citizens overseas has\nsparked a host of controversy. As of 2013, the US Government confirmed that it killed\nfour Americans in drone attacks (Taylor, 2015). Attorney General Eric Holder justified\nU.S. actions by explaining that the President may use force against senior operational\nleaders of terrorist groups with whom the United States is at war, even if the leaders are\nU.S. citizens. In 2011, the government targeted U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, a\nleader of the group al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula (Johnson, 2012). Yet, not all drone\nattacks against Americans have solely targeted terrorists. In 2015, the \nWashington Post\nreported that a U.S. drone had unintentionally killed several hostages, including an\nAmerican (Taylor, 2015).\nThe issue of drones will likely continue to permeate legal discussions surrounding\nintelligence activity, particularly as other countries develop their own capability in this\narea. Many military experts surmise that drones are the future of warfare. Although the\nChurch Committee once sought to eliminate the possibility for America to assassinate\npolitical leaders and other enemies, over time, Presidents have continually revised the\nexecutive orders governing their ability to take action against U.S. enemies.\n263\nFourth Amendment: Right to Privacy\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures.\nPolice must usually obtain a warrant to perform a search. In the same measure,\nintelligence officials may not search anywhere they desire in pursuit of information. In\nfact, they are heavily wedded to the Constitution\u2019s mandate for the protection of\npersonal liberties and for the right to due process. The Constitution\u2019s \ndue process clause\n\u201cprohibits the government from unfairly or arbitrarily depriving a person of life, liberty,\nor property\u201d (Garner, 2001). For example, the court system cannot deprive citizens of\ntheir right to liberty by placing them in prison without first providing them with a fair\ntrial.\nTo protect U.S. citizens\u2019 civil liberties, Congress created the \nForeign Intelligence\nSurveillance Act of 1978 (FISA)\n, which prohibits government agencies, such as the\nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or National Security Agency (NSA), from\nwiretapping American citizens and those designated as \u201cUS persons\u201d without first\nsatisfying several requirements. FISA allows agencies to obtain permission to wiretap\nand search non-US citizens who are foreign powers or agents of foreign powers\noperating within the United States. FISA allows the government to conduct surveillance\non U.S. persons only when the persons knowingly act on behalf of a foreign power. FISA\nbalances the government\u2019s need to collect intelligence related to national security with\ncitizens\u2019 Fourth Amendment right of freedom from unlawful searches and seizures.\n264\nHistory of FISA\nIn 1928, the Supreme Court ruled in \nOlmstead v. United States\n that the government\ncould lawfully wiretap a suspected bootlegger\u2019s telephone conversations without a\nwarrant. Several decades later, however, the Court reversed the \nOlmstead\n decision and\ndecided that law enforcement and the government needed a warrant to wiretap U.S.\ncitizens\u2019 phone conversations. In \nKatz v. United States\n (1967), police wiretapped the\nexterior of a public phone booth used by Charles Katz for illegal gambling. The\ngovernment argued that the wiretap failed to penetrate the physical space of the phone\nbooth and did not constitute an illegal Fourth Amendment search. The Supreme Court,\nhowever, disagreed and held that what a person \u201cpreserves as private, even in an area\naccessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected.\u201d Katz never intended for\nanyone to listen to his telephone conversation, and the Court held that he had a right to\nprivacy that ensured freedom from warrantless searches, such as wiretapping.\nSignificantly, however, the Court noted that \nits decision did not apply to issues of\nelectronic surveillance related to issues of national security and intelligence.\nBecause the courts failed to impose any limitations on the government for listening in\nto conversations it believed were related to national security, Presidents took full\nadvantage of opportunities to authorize wiretaps for investigations related to\nintelligence. President Roosevelt allowed Attorney General Robert Jackson to use\nelectronic surveillance in situations involving serious national security threats. President\nTruman continued wiretap surveillance after the end of World War II, as did President\nEisenhower and FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover. In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson\nimposed a safeguard on the Presidency by requiring the Attorney General to authorize\nany counterintelligence surveillance. His actions constituted the first time that anyone\nhad restricted the President\u2019s ability to conduct warrantless surveillance (Hund, 2007).\nDespite his efforts to diminish the power of his own office, however, Johnson affirmed\nand arguably expanded the power of the IC by authorizing \u201cOperation CHAOS,\u201d a\nprogram operated by the CIA to determine how foreign governments and political\norganizations influenced the Vietnam antiwar movement. In addition to spying on\nforeign citizens, the program collected information about U.S. citizens.\nOn June 19, 1972, two days after the Watergate break-in, the Supreme Court addressed\nthe President\u2019s unlimited authority to conduct surveillance related to national security in\nUnited States v. U.S. District Court (Keith)\n (Bazan & Else, 2006). The Court restricted\nthe President\u2019s ability to wiretap domestic persons in relation to national security,\nstating:\n\u2026 we conclude that the Government\u2019s concerns do not justify departure in this case from the customary Fourth\nAmendment requirement of judicial approval prior to initiation of a search or surveillance. Although some\nadded burden will be imposed upon the Attorney General, this inconvenience is justified in a free society to\nprotect constitutional values.\n265\nKeith\n involved a domestic organization\u2019s plan to bomb a CIA office in Michigan.\nAlthough the Court severely restricted the President\u2019s ability to conduct warrantless\nsurveillance on domestic targets, it refrained from addressing issues involving activities\nof foreign powers or their agents. After the \nKeith\n decision and before the enactment of\nFISA, the Fourth Circuit, in \nUnited States v. Truong Dinh Hung\n, excused the\nExecutive from securing a warrant when it conducted surveillance primarily for foreign\nintelligence reasons (Breglio, 2003). The court made clear that foreign citizens do not\nreceive the same amount of protection as U.S. citizens when it comes to Fourth\nAmendment rights.\nEvents in the mid-1970s provided the final impetus leading to the creation of FISA.\nJournalist Seymour M. Hersh revealed that the CIA had conducted illegal surveillance on\nAmerican citizens (Forgang, 2009). As a part of the Watergate scandal, President Richard\nNixon authorized domestic electronic surveillance in the name of national security on\ncivil rights activists, student groups, and war protest groups. In 1976, the Church\nCommittee investigated intelligence operations conducted over the preceding years. The\nCommittee found that government agents had often violated Title III and the Fourth\nAmendment by conducting intelligence surveillance on U.S. citizens \u201cwithout any\nlegitimate basis or suspicion of criminal activity, much less connection with foreign\npowers.\u201d The Committee\u2019s final recommendation dismissed any inherent authority on\nthe part of the President or IC to engage in illegal warrantless electronic surveillance\n(Cinquegrana, 1988\u20131989).\nIncreasing political pressure led the Ford Administration in 1976 to support legislation\nimposing judicial oversight on foreign intelligence surveil-lance. In 1978, President\nJimmy Carter signed the bill into law as the FISA (Harvard Law Review Staff, 2008).\nAt present, the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Court\n (FISC) consists of 11 federal\ndistrict court judges appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Each judge\nserves a nonrenewable seven-year term. Additionally, FISA created the \nForeign\nIntelligence Surveillance Court of Review\n (FISCR) to review decisions handed down\nby FISC. Before the attacks of 9/11, the FISCR never heard a case. Judge Collins Seitz,\nformer FISCR judge, once stated \u201cMy duties consisted of holding a title without\nfunctioning in any way \u2026 it was sort of a joke\u201d (Malooly, 1998).\nThe U.S. Supreme Court provides ultimate decision-making authority on cases\nresulting under FISA. The FISC sessions are secret, closed-door proceedings; even\ndefense attorneys are often prohibited from inspecting FISA applications (Breglio, 2003).\nAdditionally, the court conducts a weakened probable cause analysis; the government\nmust show that the target of the surveillance poses a threat to national security and that\na significant purpose of the investigation is to collect foreign intelligence. If the\ngovernment meets its threshold of evidence, the court issues an order authorizing the\ngovernment\u2019s application.\nCritics of FISA accuse the FISC of serving as a \u201crubber stamp\u201d for governmental\nsurveillance requests. Others have a different opinion. For example, Royce Lamberth, a\nformer Chief Judge of the FISC, attributed the government\u2019s pristine record to the\n266\ninternal review structure within the Department of Justice that requires approval by the\nAttorney General as well as the head of the requesting agency on each document\n(Breglio, 2003).\nAlthough FISA began as a means of electronic surveillance, the law was later\nexpanded to allow for physical searches as well. In 1993, the CIA suspected Aldrich\nAmes had provided the Russian government with information leading to the discovery\nand likely execution of 10 U.S. intelligence assets in Russia. To obtain evidence that\nproved Ames\u2019 guilt, FBI agents performed a search of his Washington, D.C. home\n(Malooly, 1998). Agents examined the contents of his house, photographed financial\ndocuments, and downloaded files from his personal computer. Their search confirmed\nAmes\u2019 relationship with the Russian government as evidenced through a telephone\nnumber to a KGB officer in Vienna, a piece of paper indicating that a meeting with the\nKGB had been rescheduled, and messages written by Ames to his KGB handler. On\nFebruary 12, 1994, the federal government arrested Ames and charged him with\nespionage. His attorney, however, threatened to argue that the FBI had conducted an\nillegal, warrantless search. Although the agents had received direct permission from\nthen-Attorney General Janet Reno to carry out the physical search of Ames\u2019 house, the\nagents did not obtain a search warrant from a federal magistrate.\nIf a court had ruled the search illegal, the government would have been forced to\nexclude all evidence garnered from the search, thus greatly eliminating the evidence\nagainst Ames. Luckily for the prosecution, Ames pled guilty. Despite the outcome of the\ncase, intelligence officials remained concerned that future physical searches undertaken\nwithout a warrant could later lead to exclusion of crucial evidence. To remedy this\npotential dilemma, Congress amended FISA in 1994 to include procedures for the\nauthorization of physical searches in pursuit of foreign intelligence information. Unlike\nTitle III searches, which require the government to alert the target after it conducts a\nphysical or electronic search, FISA does not require notice unless the government intends\nto enter into evidence or otherwise disclose the communications in trial or other official\nproceedings.\nThe \nUSA PATRIOT Act\n further amended FISA to allow multipoint or roving wiretaps\nto target persons rather than places. Prior to the amendment, electronic surveillance was\nlimited to an identified location or facility; if the target of the surveillance leftthe\nlocation, the wiretapping could not follow. The allowance of roving wiretaps was\nintended to enhance intelligence and law enforcement abilities to identify national\nsecurity threats; suspects could no longer rapidly change cellular phones, internet\naccounts, or meeting venues to escape surveillance. Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT\nAct enhanced federal officials\u2019 ability to procure medical, library, business, and travel\nrecords from institutions. Finally, the Patriot Act allowed for information obtained in a\nFISA investigation to be shared with any government investigative agency or attorney.\nIn December 2004, Section 6001(a) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Protection\nAct (IRTPA) amended FISA by expanding the definition of \u201cagent of a foreign power\u201d to\ninclude non-U.S. persons acting independent of a foreign power. The provision, which\n267\ncame to be known as the \u201clone wolf amendment,\u201d countered threats from terrorists\nacting alone and not on behalf of any governments or organizations. The amendment\ncame in response to the events surrounding Zacarias Moussaoui, a convicted terrorist\nsuspected at one time of involvement in the 9/11 plot. In the weeks leading up to the\nattack, federal law enforcement officials had sought to obtain a FISA warrant on\nMoussaoui but could not satisfy FISA\u2019s requirement that the target be an agent of a\nforeign power since he did not appear to be working on behalf of another state (Turner,\n2005).\nIn recent years, FISA has sparked legal controversy. On December 16, 2005, the \nNew\nYork Times\n published an article entitled \u201cBush Lets U.S. Spy on Callers Without Courts\u201d\n(Risen & Lichtblau, 2005). It reported, \u201cPresident Bush \u2026 secretly authorized the National\nSecurity Agency (NSA) to eavesdrop without a warrant on people in the United States\u2014\nincluding American citizens\u2014for evidence of terrorist activity\u201d (Risen & Lichtblau, 2005).\nThe article reported that beginning in 2002, NSA monitored, without a warrant,\ninternational telephone calls and international e-mail messages of \u201chundreds, perhaps\nthousands,\u201d of U.S. citizens in an effort to uncover links to al Qa\u2019ida.\nTo carry out its program, the government compelled electronic communication service\nproviders to assist with the government\u2019s intelligence activities. Following the \nNew York\nTimes\n\u2019 reveal, customers filed dozens of lawsuits against the communication providers\nand internet companies, seeking hundreds of billions of dollars in damages. In response\nto the lawsuits, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 on July 10, 2008, to\nprovide a blanket retroactive immunity to telecommunications companies who assisted\nthe government. Under the legislation, the Attorney General may immunize the\nproviders by stating that the President required the company\u2019s cooperation and that the\ncompany\u2019s operations were legal (Harvard Law Review Staff, 2009).\n268\n28 Code of Federal Regulations 23\nFor criminal intelligence, \nTitle 28, Part 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations\n (CFR )\ngoverns state and local law enforcement agencies\u2019 criminal intelligence systems that\nreceive federal funding through the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of\n1968. The code was adopted in 1980 after it was discovered that law enforcement\nagencies were abusing their authority by keeping files on the political activities of\nAmericans without establishing \nany legal threshold of reasonable suspicion or probable\ncause. In response to law enforcement agencies\u2019 egregious actions, the code prohibits\nsuch agencies from retaining intelligence on innocent people. The code does not apply to\nlaw enforcement agencies\u2019 case management databases, tips and leads files, records\nmanagement systems, criminal history records, and other non-intelligence databases\n(U.S. Department of Justice, n.d.). Rather, it applies only to criminal intelligence\ncompiled into electronic databases, often in conjunction with cases regarding loan\nsharking, drug trafficking, trafficking in stolen property, gambling, extortion, smuggling,\nbribery, and corruption of public officials (28 CFR 23). Law enforcement agencies use\nthese databases to pool and share information with other agencies. The code recognizes\nthat the collection of such information can violate the privacy rights of those whose\ninformation is contained within the databases.\nTo guard against the violation of privacy rights, law enforcement agencies must at\nleast have \nreasonable suspicion\n that individuals are engaging in or are going to engage\nin criminal behavior. This requirement is intended to eliminate the possibility that the\npolice will gather and retain information on people who are not doing anything wrong.\nFurthermore, the database may not contain information about an individual\u2019s political,\nreligious, or social views, or associations unless such information relates directly to\ncriminal conduct. In other words, any political or religious viewpoints protected by the\nFirst Amendment may not be used as grounds for opening an investigation against\nsomeone. Law enforcement agencies can only share the information contained in the\ndatabase on a need to know/right to know basis. Furthermore, the information must be\nstored securely on a computer or server and housed in safe facilities. Users must\nmaintain an audit trail detailing to whom the information has been disseminated.\nPeriodically, officials must conduct a review of the information stored in the database\nand destroy any information that is misleading, obsolete, or unreliable (28 CFR 23).\nThe issue of 28 CFR 23 is pertinent to another controversial legal issue related to\nintelligence: state fusion centers. State and major urban fusion centers are hubs for state\nand local law enforcement sharing of intelligence information. Some organizations, such\nas the ACLU, have argued that fusion centers pose threats to civil liberties, as they\nincreasingly evolve into a \u201cdomestic intelligence apparatus.\u201d The fusion centers often\ncollaborate sharing of intelligence databases between law enforcement agencies. In 2008,\n269\nthe \nWall Street Journal\n and the \nNew York Times\n both reported on an order in the Los\nAngeles Police Department (LAPD) requiring its officers to report \u201csuspicious behaviors\u201d\nto local fusion centers. The ACLU released a report, detailing the LAPD\u2019s order as\nrequiring police to \u201cgather, record, and analyze information of a criminal or \nnon-\ncriminal nature\n (emphasis by ACLU), that \ncould indicate activity or intentions related to\neither foreign or domestic terrorism\u201d (Fusion Center Update: 2). The LAPD officers were\ninstructed to record such activities as people \u201ctaking measurements, using binoculars,\ntaking pictures or video footage \u2018with no apparent esthetic value, abandoning vehicle,\ndrawing diagrams, taking notes, [and] espousing extremist views\u2019\u201d (German & Stanley,\n2008). The ACLU argued that the LAPD\u2019s collection of \u201cnoncriminal\u201d information\nviolated 28 CFR 23 because such reporting of noncriminal behavior violated the code\u2019s\nrequirement that law enforcement agencies only compile information on subjects whom\nthey reasonably suspect may be breaking the law. The report found that law\nenforcement agencies had compiled information that violated First Amendment rights.\nFor example, a peace activist in Maryland was entered into a federal database under the\nheading of \u201cTerrorism\u2013anti-government\u201d even though he had not displayed any\nbehavior that suggested violence or that would have provoked reasonable suspicion\n(German & Stanley, 2008).\n270\nFirst Amendment Issues and Intelligence\nThe police cannot investigate people based solely on viewpoints that they find offensive,\nbecause the First Amendment generally protects unpopular viewpoints. For instance, the\nFirst Amendment allows white supremacists the right to protest peacefully and to\ndistribute literature to make their opinions known. If white supremacists move from\npeacefully protesting to inciting lawless action, such as violence or a riot, then the First\nAmendment no longer protects the speech. Fighting words, or true threats, are also not\nprotected. Thus, the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s act of burning a cross on a lawn in an effort to\nintimidate someone would not be protected by the First Amendment.\nBut how does the First Amendment apply when people want to reveal classified\ninformation about the IC? Under the Espionage Act, civilians do not have the right to\nreveal classified information to the public, and military personnel do not have a right to\nreveal classified information under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). In\n2010, Bradley Manning, a U.S. military intelligence analyst, allegedly violated the UCMJ\nby possessing classified information on his personal computer and later revealing the\ninformation, including diplomatic cables and videos of U.S. military airstrikes, to\nWikileaks and to Reuters journalists. While serving as an analyst in Iraq, Manning was\nallowed access to a great deal of classified information. The military alleges that\nManning used music CD-ROMs to copy hundreds of thousands of classified files, which\nhe then dispersed in an effort to demonstrate his disagreement with the U.S. military\u2019s\nwartime actions. Some \ncitizens have protested in favor of Manning\u2019s actions, arguing\nthat he should be allowed to reveal classified information that the public has a right to\nknow about (Nakashima, 2011). One of Manning\u2019s supporters is Daniel Ellsberg, a former\nU.S. military analyst and RAND Corporation employee who leaked a classified\ngovernment report to the \nNew York Times\n during the Vietnam War.\nIn the 1970s, Ellsberg sent journalists at the \nNew York Times\n a classified government\nreport officially titled, \u201cUnited States\u2013Vietnam Relations, 1945\u20131967: A Study Prepared\nby the Department of Defense.\u201d The document is more popularly known as the\n\u201cPentagon Papers.\u201d The classified report detailed American involvement in Vietnam\u2014\nincluding forays into Cambodia and Laos\u2014proving that President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s\nadministration had been less than forthcoming with the public and with Congress (\nNew\nYork Times v. United States\n, 1971).\nThe \nNew York Times\n wished to publish the report, much to the chagrin of the Nixon\nAdministration, which believed that the publication would set a bad precedent by\nallowing journalists to reveal classified information. The issue eventually landed in the\nSupreme Court in the case \nNew York Times v. United States\n. The \nTimes\n sought to publish\ninformation from the report, but the government argued that doing so would cause the\npaper\u2019s journalists to violate the Espionage Act of 1917 (Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 793). After\n271\nhearing oral arguments, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the \nNew York Times\n and\nheld that the government had not met the high threshold required for it to restrain a\nnewspaper from publishing information. Justice Hugo Black wrote that\nto find that the President has \u2018inherent power\u2019 to halt the publication of news by resort to the courts would wipe\nout the First Amendment and destroy the fundamental liberty and security of the very people the Government\nhopes to make \u2018secure.\u2019\nThe Court recognized, in the event that such publication poses \u201cdirect, immediate, and\nirreparable damage\u201d to the United States or its citizens, the government could enjoin a\npublisher from printing something. Short of the government proving such harm,\nhowever (and the Court was clear that the government could not merely surmise that\nsuch harm \nmight\n occur; the government needed to prove with near certainty that such\nharm would occur), it could not prevent publication by the press of classified\ninformation. The Court explained its reasoning, saying that such government restraints\non newspaper publications would render useless the First Amendment. Justice Stewart\nwrote:\nIn the absence of the governmental checks and balances present in other areas of our national life, the only\neffective restraint upon executive policy \nand power in the areas of national defense and international affairs may\nlie in an enlightened citizenry\u2014in an informed and critical public opinion which alone can here protect the\nvalues of democratic government. For this reason, it is perhaps here that a press that is alert, aware, and free\nmost vitally serves the basic purpose of the First Amendment. For without an informed and free press there\ncannot be an enlightened people. (\nNew York Times v. United States\n, 1971)\nThe Supreme Court held that journalism provides an unparalleled means for keeping the\ngovernment accountable. In situations like those pertaining to classified information and\nthe IC, there are not many ways to hold intelligence agencies accountable because the\nwork they do is shrouded in so much secrecy. The Court, however, argued that too much\nclassification could be a bad thing. Justice Stewart wrote, \u201cWhen everything is classified,\nthen nothing is classified, and the system becomes one to be disregarded by the cynical\nor the careless.\u201d (\nNew York Times v. United States\n, 1971). He argued that the government\nshould seek to disclose as much information as possible to retain credibility. The Court\ndecided that unless the published classified information presented inevitable, immediate,\nand direct threat against the United States, then newspapers should be allowed to\npublish the information. Furthermore, the government found that a journalist\u2019s\npublication of classified documents did not violate the Espionage Act.\n272\nUSA PATRIOT Act\nAfter the attacks of 9/11, the government enacted several key laws to aid in investigating\nand prosecuting terrorists. One of the first major changes came about through the USA\nPATRIOT Act of 2001, more commonly referred to as the \u201cPATRIOT Act.\u201d The Act, an\nacronym for \u201cUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools\nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,\u201d gave the Executive Branch the authority\nto monitor electronic communications and seize records, including phone bills and\nlibrary records. According to a recent ACLU report, since 9/11, the government has\nobtained an increasing number of FISA warrants. Agencies such as the FBI have also\nissued an increasing number of \nnational security letters\n, which are administrative\nsubpoenas or \u201csecret demand letters\u201d that allow the government to demand customer\ninformation from communications providers, financial institutions, and credit agencies\n(Doyle, 2010). They also allow the government to obtain financial records, credit reports,\ntelephone and e-mail communications, and internet searches. Recipients of national\nsecurity letters must keep their existence secret. Additionally, the government does not\nneed \nto meet any evidentiary standard such as probable cause or reasonable suspicion\nwhen issuing a national security letter.\nIn addition to expanding the government\u2019s ability to use national security letters, the\nPATRIOT Act also expanded a law prohibiting material support for terrorism. In \nHolder\nv. Humanitarian Law Project\n (2009), the Supreme Court heard arguments from\nrepresentatives of the Project who wished to provide financial support to the lawful and\nnonviolent activities of two groups that the Department of State had designated terrorist\norganizations. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court found that \nany\n material support to a\nterrorist organization, regardless of the supporters\u2019 intentions, violates the PATRIOT Act.\nThe Court found that terrorist organizations often do not entirely separate the financial\nholdings of their peaceful and humanitarian based operations from their violent,\nterrorist-based activities. As such, the PATRIOT Act criminalizes an American\u2019s support\nof any known terrorist groups, whether the supporter means to give to the peaceful\npurposes of a group or whether they mean to support the group\u2019s terrorist ideals.\nSupporters of the PATRIOT Act claim that many of its regulations greatly assisted in\npost 9/11 investigations, allowing for greater sharing among intelligence agencies\n(Abramson & Godoy, 2006). Such a claim is particularly noteworthy, since the 9/11\nCommission found that a lack of information sharing between federal agencies\ncontributed to the attacks. As discussed previously, the Act also amended rules regarding\ngovernmental wiretaps in FISA, allowing one wiretap authorization to cover multiple\ndevices connected to one person.\nAlthough many of the PATRIOT Act provisions have expired, Congress has kept some\nof them in place, renewing them as the years go by to allow for continued investigation.\n273\nWhen former IC employee Edward Snowden leaked NSA documents to the media in\n2013, he ignited public debate about the legality of intelligence agencies\u2019 collection under\nthe PATRIOT Act. Snowden\u2019s documents showed that the U.S. government used the\nPATRIOT Act to justify its demand that communications providers, such as Verizon,\nhand over call records of U.S. citizens to the NSA. Though a federal appeals court in 2015\nruled that such collection efforts on the part of the government are illegal, the NSA and\nother agencies continue to collect bulk information from communication providers (Ball,\n2015).\nSnowden also leaked information showing that the NSA\u2019s electronic collections allow\nfor bulk collection of big data on both U.S. and non-U.S. citizens. The collection of such\ninformation on U.S. citizens remains controversial, with Snowden supporters alleging\nthat the intelligence community has over-reached the provisions of the PATRIOT Act by\nillegally collecting information on U.S. citizens. Presently, the topic remains a fixture in\nthe public debate \non privacy, as Congress continues discussions on the PATRIOT Act\nrelated to bulk collection of information on U.S. citizens.\n274\nIntelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act\nThe IRTPA replaced the CIA\u2019s DCI with the DNI. For the first time in history, Congress\nresponded to the many arguments that had been launched since before the CIA was ever\nestablished. Critics had long argued that, unlike the DCI, one central figure should\noversee the entire IC and that such a person should be independent of any of the IC\nagencies. IRTPA was drafted in response to the 9/11 Commission, which found that the\nIC lacked the ability to coordinate the sharing of information. The creation of the DNI is\ndiscussed in greater detail in \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d).\n275\nTerrorism and Legal Proceedings\nQuestions have arisen regarding the legal implications of trying terrorists for criminal\nacts during wartime. Recent actions in Afghanistan and Iraq have presented challenges\nregarding the handling of prisoner of war detainees. In 2004, the Supreme Court decided\ntwo cases related to terrorists. In \nHamdi v. Rumsfeld\n, the Court recognized that the\nUnited States could detain, for the duration of the conflict, individuals captured incident\nto war, but the Court also stated that detainees who were U.S. citizens had the right to\nchallenge their classification as an enemy combatant before a neutral decision-maker. In\nBoumediene v. Bush\n, the Supreme Court found that even non-U.S. citizens who are\nheld as detainees in Guantanamo (see \nFigure 10.2\n) have a right to seek a \nwrit of \nhabeas\ncorpus\n. \nHabeas corpus\n allows a prisoner to demonstrate that they are being held in\nviolation of the law or due to an erroneous application of the law. The privilege can only\nbe withdrawn according to Article 1, \u00a79 of the Constitution, known as the Suspension\nClause. The Suspension Clause allows the government to \u201csuspend\u201d prisoners\u2019 rights to\nhabeas corpus\n in the event of rebellion or invasion that threatens U.S. citizens. The\nSupreme Court, in \nBoumediene\n, found that none of the requirements necessary to justify\nsuspension of \nhabeas corpus\n had been met, and the justices argued that detainees held at\na Guantanamo military detention center in Cuba had a right to argue the unlawfulness\nof their detention (Boumediene v. Bush, 2008).\nFollowing \nBoumediene\n, federal courts and the military grappled with the question of\nwhere to try Guantanamo detainees. The court made clear in \nBoumediene\n that the\nprisoners had a right to question the lawfulness of their\n276\nFigure 10.2\n The U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. (Source: U.S. Navy)\ndetention. But how should they go about asking the court such questions? Lawyers\nargued that prisoners could be tried either in federal civilian courts or in front of military\ncommissions. Some legal scholars have argued a need for a third option; because the War\non Terror is a hybrid of law enforcement and military warfare, attorneys such as Glenn\nSulmasy have argued for the creation of a National Security Court to offer a level of\nsecrecy necessary for terrorist prosecutions while maintaining prisoner rights:\n[Guantanamo Bay] has tarnished world opinion of the United States of America\u2014both at home and abroad.\nRegrettably, other nation\u2013states, nongovernmental organizations, and many American citizens have come to see\nGuantanamo Bay as a symbol of prejudice, lawlessness, arbitrary detention, and the type of coercive\ninterrogation that has been described as torture. (Sulmasy, 2009)\nNongovernmental organizations, such as Amnesty International (AI), have likewise\ncriticized the use of Guantanamo as a detention facility. In a recent publication, AI noted\nthat only one detainee has to date been prosecuted in a civilian federal court. The\nremaining detainees have been prosecuted \nin military commissions or continue to await\ntrial. Despite promises to close the facility in his January 2009 inauguration speech,\nPresident Obama announced it would remain open. Additionally, he reinstated the use of\nmilitary commissions for prisoners.\n277\nClassified Information Procedures Act\nOnce intelligence-related cases make it to trial, prosecutors and defense attorneys must\ndeal with the sensitive issue of classified material. If the prosecution finds itself dealing\nwith such items, it may seek an order from the court to protect the disclosure of any\nclassified information to a defendant in a criminal case. The \nClassified Information\nProcedures Act\n (CIPA) is designed to guard against \ngray mail\n, or a defendant\u2019s threat\nto release classified information to the public. The court may decide that any classified\nportion of documents used as evidence by the prosecution will be removed before they\nare provided to the defense. The government also may pre sent classified information \u201cin\ncamera\u201d to the judge, meaning the hearing is not open to the defense. The trial judge\nmust carefully consider all of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, despite the fact that the defense\ncannot present its side of the argument. In addition to pertaining to instances of the\nprosecution using classified information as evidence of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing,\nCIPA may also include instances when a defendant claims that he or she acted illegally\non behalf of an assignment from the IC. In such circumstances, the defendant will use\nCIPA as a defense to excuse any wrongdoing on their part.\n278\nEthics\nThe issue of intelligence raises a host of ethical questions. The act of collection, of\nconvincing individuals to commit treason against their own country, elicits questions of\nmoral ambiguity (Olson, 2006). Even the act of recruiting someone as a spy in a process\nknown as the agent acquisition cycle, can present a challenge, as people are arguably\nseen as a means to an end rather than an end within themselves.\nThe act of capturing terrorists and other enemies of war also raises ethical issues in\nrelation to the use of torture and extraordinary rendition. In the past, the IC has used\ntorture to elicit information from suspected terrorists, although the reliability of the\ninformation is often suspect or simply erroneous. As discussed in \nChapter 9\n (\u201cCovert\nAction\u201d), extraordinary rendition occurs when the United States transfers suspected\nterrorists to countries that do not adhere to stringent human rights standards. Although\nthe United States is unable to deal inhumanely with the subjects, other countries will not\nhesitate, thereby providing a way for the United States to keep its hands clean while\nother countries perform the dirty work of extracting information (ACLU, 2005).\nAnalysis also presents an ethical conundrum, as analysts must strive to free their\nconclusions from bias and politicization. One of the most difficult aspects of being an\nanalyst involves telling a policy maker the conclusions that they do not want to hear.\nAnalysts must strive to present their analysis in an unbiased way, even if their\nconclusions are unpopular. Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates explained:\n[T]he challenge for us as analysts, then, is to produce intelligence that objectively assesses relevant policy issues\n\u2014whether it supports or undermines current policy trends\u2014and to ensure that our product is read and valued by\nthe policymakers concerned. (Goldman, 2006)\nAnalysts walk the fine line of meeting policymakers\u2019 needs while also trying to tell them\nthings they might not want to hear.\n279\nConclusion\nThe IC has evolved from a structure with few rules and little oversight to a massive\nbureaucracy that is scrutinized on a routine basis. Today, laws and guidelines exist\nwithin every agency. The press and critics wait breathlessly for the next IC misstep,\nhoping to sell papers or forward political agendas.\nUnfortunately, the world of today is a difficult place to navigate. There are many new\nand emerging threats, and the fast-paced, globalized realities of life offer little chance for\nstudied reflection. Added to that are the growing set of rules and regulations that all\nmust follow.\nGiven these challenges, it is easy for IC professionals to grow frustrated and cynical.\nHowever, we must remember that laws and rules have been established for a reason\u2014\nwhen there were few or none, abuses of power such as operations COINTELPRO and\nChaos ensued. America\u2019s greatness is attributable in no small measure to the protections\nand rights it affords its citizens. The U.S. Constitution has proven to be a sturdy and\nresilient covenant between a government and its people. It has stood the test of time for\nmore than 200 years, even as other nations have crumbled and disintegrated.\nIntelligence exists on the outskirts of democracy; as such, its use must be judicious and\nin keeping with the letter and the spirit of the law. In dangerous times, it is easy to lose\none\u2019s bearings and feel that the \u201cends justify the means.\u201d It is precisely then that laws,\nguidelines, and ethics are the most important. Every officer of the United States takes an\noath to \u201csupport and defend the \nConstitution.\u201d No similar declaration is made to protect\nany officer or office, including that of the President. This demonstrates that America is a\nland where the rule of law is supreme. To deny its protections and procedures to any is\nto diminish us all. To that end, those who wish to work in the IC must both understand\nand be willing to abide by those principles.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nSome people claim that intelligence activities are antithetical to a democracy.\nDo you agree? Why or why not?\n2\n. \nWhat rules and guidelines (e.g., PATRIOT Act, FISA) make sense for the\ntwenty-first century? Which ones do not? If you were the Congress, which\nlaws would you discard? What new types of laws would you pass?\n3\n. \nWhat is the difference between laws and ethics? How does each fit in the\nintelligence world?\n4\n. \nIt has been said that the Constitution is not a \u201csuicide pact.\u201d Many interpret\nthat to mean that, in a time of crisis, certain rights should be limited. Do you\n280\nagree with that? If so, in the current struggle against international terrorism,\ngive some examples of rights that should be curtailed.\n281\nKey Terms\nAuthorization for the Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF)\nBoumediene v.

This chapter\nwill describe the various written products produced by the IC and discuss how\nintelligence analysts write for and brief policymakers.\n287\nWriting\nA brochure about the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s (CIA) Sherman Kent School\ndescribed the Directorate of Analysis\u2019s approach to writing, stating \u201c[Agency] writing\nstyle emphasizes the bottom line up front, precise and concise language, and a clear\narticulation of our judgments and our confidence in them\u201d (Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence, 2004).\nThis description captures the essence of what intelligence analysts do: they write for\nbusy policymakers and provide them with products about complex subjects that are easy\nto read and comprehend.\nWhat distinguishes good intelligence writing? Well-written intelligence products are\nconcise and logical, both in reasoning and structure. They create clear judgments and\nconclusions about complex and ambiguous information that decision-makers can easily\nabsorb. Good intelligence meets the audiences\u2019 needs and provides decision-makers with\nwhat they need to know. Amid a sea of intelligence products, good intelligence writing\ndraws the attention of supervisors and busy decision-makers and informs or persuades\nthem. Intelligence reports tell policymakers what threatens the country\u2014 whether it is\nsomething monumental, such as a natural disaster, civil unrest, or another state\u2019s\naggressive actions, or something less urgent, such as in-depth reports detailing current\nsituations around the world. Theoretically, policymakers need to read what intelligence\nanalysts write in order to make decisions; analysts need only write something that can\nbe easily read and understood that addresses a policymaker\u2019s concerns. Though the\nconcept behind intelligence writing is simple, the art of writing such products, and\ndisseminating them to policymakers, takes skill and practice.\n288\nTypes of Intelligence Writing\nMuch of intelligence writing is collaborative; analysts write alongside other analysts\nwithin their organizations, or they write with analysts from other agencies. Analysts\nmay also write products by themselves. Policymakers and warfighters read analysts\u2019\npapers; oftentimes, the analysts personally brief policymakers and military leaders about\ntheir judgments or conclusions. \nDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA) products are typically\nwritten for the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, CIA products are\nwritten for the White House, and the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and\nResearch products go to the Secretary of State. Most intelligence products are also made\navailable to Congress.\nIntelligence papers can be strategic or tactical. \nNational Intelligence Estimates\n(NIEs)\n are the perfect example of strategic pieces, as they take an international issue that\naffects U.S. national security and assess, long-term, how the issue will continue to affect\nthe United States in the coming months and years. Tactical pieces are often more\nimmediate and comprise information needed by the military or intelligence collectors\ncrucial to carrying out operations.\nThere are several different types of analytical written products. DIA intelligence\nwriting instructor James S. Major writes, \u201cintelligence products have three general forms:\nbasic, current, and estimative intelligence. Each form might then describe, explain,\npredict or evaluate\u201d (Major, 2008). Analysts also write in-depth or situational studies that\nexamine current issues and forecast changes. They write warning analyses to predict the\nlikelihood that certain threats will materialize. They write \nbasic intelligence\n, creating an\nencyclopedic recording of information pertinent to U.S. security, such as detailed\ninformation about another country\u2019s weapons systems or military capabilities.\nCurrent, or \ndaily intelligence\n, involves issues immediately affecting U.S. security; it is\nsimilar to news reports but also contains classified information. It usually tells a\npolicymaker what has happened within the past 24 hours and discusses ramifications of\nthe recent events. This timely information may be disseminated to decision-makers mere\nminutes after the product is written. The \nPresident\u2019s Daily Brief (PDB)\n, a publication\npresented to the President each morning, is the perfect example of this (\nFigure 11.1\n). The\nPDB is assembled by a small team of senior-level analysts. It includes snippets taken\nfrom reports written by analysts from all 17 intelligence agencies, making it the\nPresident\u2019s ultimate morning newspaper. Senior-level analysts assemble the PDB each\nnight into the early morning hours, taking reports from thousands of analysts and\ndistilling the final product down to the best-written and most timely intelligence. Each\nmorning, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) delivers the PDB to\nthe President. He decides whether he wants the PDB briefed to him in person by an\nanalyst or whether he prefers to read it himself; George W. Bush preferred the former,\n289\nwhereas Barack Obama preferred the latter. The PDB does more than merely tell the\nPresident what he needs to know. Rather, its content is directed to the President,\naccording to his interests and questions. After analysts brief the President, they return to\nODNI and \ntask the President\u2019s questions to analysts to provide follow-up information for\nthe next briefing (Bensen, 2008).\nFigure 11.1\n A page from the President\u2019s Intelligence Check List (PICL) dated June 17, 1961. The PICL was first\nprepared for President John F. Kennedy and was the predecessor of the present-day President\u2019s Daily Brief\n(PDB). (Source: CIA)\nUnlike current intelligence, \nwarning intelligence\n looks at potential threats against\nU.S. interests and prioritizes the issues with which the IC is concerned. In her classic\nmilitary textbook \nAnticipating Surprise: Analysis for Strategic Warning\n, former DIA\nanalyst Cynthia Grabo (2002) defined warning intelligence, stating:\nWhether or not an immediate crisis or threat exists \u2026 the function of warning intelligence also is to examine\ncontinually\u2014and to repeat periodically, or daily if necessary\u2014any developments which could indicate that a\nhostile state or group is preparing, or could be preparing, some new action which could endanger U.S. security\ninterests. It renders a judgment\u2014positive, negative or qualified\u2014that \nthere is\n or \nis not\n a threat of new military\naction, or an impending change in the nature of ongoing military actions, of which the policy maker should be\nwarned.\nAnalysts construct warning analysis based on indicators and look for the existence of\ncertain facts, deployments, or reports\u2014or the lack thereof\u2014 which indicate whether a\nthreat is valid. Analysts ask such questions as, \u201cIf this threat were real, what sort of\n290\nthings would happen before it emerged?\u201d Such things, which must be present for a threat\nto materialize, are known as indicators. Warnings can be both strategic and tactical. A\nwarning is never a certainty\u2014rather, it is the analyst\u2019s most educated prediction about\nwhat might or might not happen. Most of all, warning analysis alerts the policymaker to\nreal threats and assuages their concern regarding fears that are unlikely to materialize.\nWarning analysis serves as a compass to let policy-makers know what should or should\nnot concern them (National Security Agency, 1981).\nAlthough \nestimative intelligence\n also contains analytical forecasts regarding what\nmight occur in the future, it does not serve the same function as warning analysis.\nWarning analysis starts with a threat and examines whether any indicators exist to\ndetermine if the threat will occur. Estimates, on the other hand, \u201care not predictions of\nthe future. They are considered judgments as to the likely course of events regarding an\nissue of importance to the nation. Sometimes, more than one outcome may be estimated\u201d\n(Best, 2011). Instead of beginning with a threat, NIEs, the most common form of\nestimative intelligence, look at a host of current situations to examine the way they\nmight affect national security within a given timeframe. Analysts from across the IC\nassemble NIEs, which are described as (Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, 2004: 8):\n[the] most authoritative written judgment concerning a specific national security issue \u2026 [NIEs] provide\npolicymakers in both the executive and legislative branches with the best, unvarnished, and unbiased\ninformation\u2014regardless of whether analytic judgments conform to any particular policy objective.\nMembers of the Executive Branch and Congress as well as military commanders often\nrequest NIEs from the IC.\nIn NIEs, analysts assess the issue at hand and forecast how the issue might further\ndevelop in the future. Oftentimes, analysts include alternative analysis to document the\ndissenting opinions of those writing the product; because so many people across so many\nagencies are involved in the writing of an NIE, analysts often fail to unanimously agree\non their final judgments. A 2002 NIE about the nuclear capabilities of Iraq contained a\nfootnote describing the Department of State Bureau of Intelligence and Research\u2019s\ndisagreement with the consensus opinion of the report; although the majority of\nintelligence analysts believed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction\n(WMDs), the State Department disagreed, based on their prior knowledge \nof France\u2019s\ninvolvement with Niger, the country that the NIE alleged had sold uranium to Iraq.\nAnalysts also write what intelligence veteran Arthur Hulnick terms \nin-depth reports\n\u2014these situational reports and profiles cover myriad topics intended for use by\npolicymakers. The reports can be long or short. These are not intended for policymakers\nwho have decision-making authority. Rather, they are intended for use by working-level\npolicymakers who continue to work for long periods of time on certain projects and need\nadditional and detailed information.\n291\nWriting for an Audience\nAnalysts write different types of intelligence products. They must understand that the\naudience for current or daily intelligence is different from the audience for estimates or\nin-depth reports. Policymakers, who use intelligence to help them craftpolicy, require\ndifferent information from military leaders, who use intelligence on the battlefield.\nAnalysts must prove the value of their product to their audience by making the product\nrelevant to the audience\u2019s needs. Analytical writing must answer the \u201cwhat,\u201d \u201cso what,\u201d\nand \u201cwhy\u201d questions of decision-makers. Policymakers and military leaders are routinely\ninundated with more information than they can ever possibly process; therefore, the\nanalyst must demonstrate the value of their analysis or it will go unnoticed.\nWhen writing, analysts must keep in mind their readers\u2019 occupational positions or\nrank and their level of influence. A policymaker\u2019s position will affect what interests\nthem as they will be interested in the things relevant to their authority. Analysts must\nalso understand their readers\u2019 level of expertise\u2014 if the reader knows a lot about a\nsubject, an analyst can forgo background information and detail. The analyst may be\nchallenged to tell the reader something he or she does not already know. On the other\nhand, if the reader has little knowledge about the analyst\u2019s topic, the analyst must adjust\nand make any complex judgments understandable.\nIn addition to understanding the reader\u2019s background and level of expertise, an\nanalyst should assess what the reader will want to know about the topic. For instance,\nmilitary decision-makers will require different information than the Secretary of State\nbecause both entities serve different purposes and use intelligence in different ways.\nAnalysts should anticipate the questions that their readers will ask and attempt to\nanswer those questions within the body of the work.\nThere are many publications throughout the IC; some are interagency and require\nparticipation from the entire community. Different publications provide the proper\nvenue for different types of intelligence. Just as a novel is not the place \nto explain in\ndetail how to construct a house, analysts know to publish different types of analysis in\nthe appropriate intelligence publications. When the President receives daily intelligence\nin the PDB, that intelligence is merely intended to discuss current events, primarily\nwithin the past 24 hours. The PDB is not intended to alert the President to impending\nterrorist attacks or to assist him or her in declaring war or ordering an attack. Many\npeople criticized the IC after September 11, 2001, because the PDB contained at least one\nentry related to the impending attacks. An August 6, 2001 report discussed terrorists\u2019\npossible use of commercial aircraftto attack U.S. buildings. Intelligence officials,\nhowever, have defended the President\u2019s oversight. Hulnick (2006: 965) explains:\n[N]ormally the PDB would not have been the kind of intelligence product used for warning. The warning would\nhave been delivered in a much more specific document devoted entirely to the subject.\n292\nIntelligence analysts must place information in the proper type of publication. For\nexample, information suggesting a terrorist attack should not be nestled within the many\nreports included in a PDB. Rather, such information should appear in a situational report\nor even an NIE; the information is crucial to national security and deserves the\nundivided attention of policymakers.\nHow to Write Intelligence Products\nAlthough an analytical report may crucially influence a policymaker\u2019s ability to make a\ndecision, chances are the policymaker will have very little time to read through the\nreport. Decision-makers are extremely busy people, and they likely will not read a report\nword for word. Therefore, the golden rule of intelligence writing is \nBLUF\n\u2014\nbottom line\nup front\n. Unlike academic papers, which posit a thesis early into the paper and save the\ngrand conclusions for the very end, intelligence papers need to tell a policymaker the\nmain point in the first paragraph on the first page of the paper. The BLUF should be\nwritten as a declarative sentence; for example, \u201cin the last six months, Utopia\u2019s currency\nhas destabilized, the military has revolted against the government\u2019s executive power,\nand the country will very likely become a failed state within the next three months.\u201d\nThanks to the BLUF format, if a policymaker has only a few seconds or few minutes to\nread a report, he or she will see, with ease, what the report is about and what \nkey\njudgments\n the analyst has made. The BLUF answers the question of \u201cso what\u201d\u2014it\nconveys the meaning behind the analysis. After reading the BLUF, if a policymaker\nwants more detail they can continue reading for information about evidence that\nsupports the bottom line. Like an inverted triangle, intelligence reports begin with\ngeneralized information and later move to more specific information. The most\nimportant information should be placed at the \nbeginning of the paper. With BLUF,\ninformation is distilled to its main point\u2014 in one or two sentences, what must a\npolicymaker learn from reading a report? That crucial information belongs at the\nbeginning of the paper.\nAlthough few students or analysts have had the experience of being a policymaker,\nthey can often identify nonetheless with a policymaker\u2019s limited ability to read\nsomething because of time constraints. College undergraduate students receive lengthy\nreading assignments; graduate students often receive assignments for more pages of\nreading than is possible for most people to complete. Sometimes, students must skim the\nassignment. Although skimming is never the ideal, most students have at one point or\nanother become overwhelmed with class work or procrastinated to the point that they\nmust skim an assignment for brevity\u2019s sake. Any student who has done so knows that\nsome assignments are easier to skim than others; when students are given long chapters\nor books with paragraphs that stretch for pages, ambiguous or complicated language,\nand few subheadings or summaries, trying to glean the meaningful information from the\nproduct in a short amount of time turns out to be difficult or even impossible.\n293\nAlternatively, a textbook with summaries at the beginning of each chapter, short\nparagraphs, informative subheadings, and easy-to-read language is much easier to digest\nin a short amount of time. Intelligence writing should follow such an organized format;\nheadings, bolded conclusions, and clear, concise language help make intelligence\nproducts readable.\nMagazines and newspapers are almost always easier to skim than books because they\ninclude summaries, subheadings, shorter paragraphs and words, and less content. Many\nhave likened intelligence analysts to journalists. The ability to write a report that can be\neasily read is a true talent in the IC and something that distinguishes an analyst from his\nor her peers.\nTo write easily readable papers, intelligence analysts should organize the structure\nand order of their writing before beginning the first draft. Analysts need to know what\nthey mean to say before they say it. Writing intelligence is not the same as writing a\nnovel\u2014some novelists sit down, begin writing, and watch as their characters and plot\nunfold in unexpected ways. An intelligence analyst does not sit down, start typing, and\nsee where things go; they do not posit, \u201cI\u2019ll figure out, as I write, whether or not X\ncountry has weapons of mass destruction.\u201d Rather, they think about what they want to\nsay ahead of time, organize their thoughts accordingly, and draftan outline. Once they\nare sure of what they want to say, they begin writing. This method of writing helps to\nensure that the analysis is sound and that conclusions are firmly supported by evidence.\nAnalysts must also crafta compelling \ntitle\n that informs policymakers about the\nsubstance of their paper. Because there is so much written each \nday within the IC, when\nsenior analysts put together such documents as the PDB, they often look first at the titles\nof the papers they receive. If a title fails to spark any interest, the analysts may disregard\nthe paper and not include it in the PDB or ever give it a close reading. In the past, IC\nNIEs have used the following titles:\nIran Under Rafsanjani: Seeking a New Role in the World Community\n (1991)\nInsurgency and Counterinsurgency in Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador\n (1987)\nPRC (People\u2019s Republic of China) Defense Policy and Armed Forces\n (1976)\nCommunist Military and Economic Aid to North Vietnam, 1970\u20131974\n (1975)\nChina\u2019s Strategic Attack Programs\n (1974)\nPossible Changes in the Sino\u2014Soviet Relationship\n (1973)\nThe Short-Term Prospect for Cambodia Through the Current Dry Season\n (1973)\nCommunist China\u2019s Reactions to Developments in Laos\n (1971)\nThe Soviet Role in Latin America\n (1971)\nCapabilities of the Vietnamese Communists for Fighting in South Vietnam\n (1969)\nThe Potential for Revolution in Latin America\n (1969)\nThe Short-Term Outlook in Communist China\n (1968)\nKhrushchev, Castro, and Latin American\n (1963)\nNotice how each of the titles informs the reader of exactly what the NIE will discuss; the\ntitles are not merely descriptive but also analytic. They signal the question that the BLUF\nwill answer. They do not use creative titles that leave a reader guessing what the report\nwill discuss. Notice the eye-catching 1991 NIE title, \u201cThe Winter of the Soviet Military:\nCohesion or Collapse?\u201d Without the added phrase, \u201ccohesion or collapse,\u201d the reader\n294\nwould have a difficult time determining what the NIE discusses\u2014is the NIE literally\ndiscussing the winter season in the Soviet Union? Is the NIE discussing a figurative sort\nof winter, and if so, what exactly does the author mean to say?\nAnalysts must remember that when writing they are putting together an \nargument\nsupported by evidence. By argument, we mean that analysts have examined a situation,\nissue, or group of people and decided that something is a certain way. For instance, they\nhave decided that a dictator poses a threat to U.S. national security, they have decided\nthat a country\u2019s economic instability could result in human rights violations, or maybe\nthey have decided that a certain strain of virus will likely lead to an outbreak. In each\ninstance, the \nanalyst must prove that their conclusion\u2014their \nargument\n for how the\nworld is\u2014is correct. To prove their argument, analysts must support their contentions\nwith evidence. Thus, to write a good intelligence product, analysts start by assembling\nthe best sources they can possibly find. When conducting research, many students\nperform a cursory internet search and use whatever sources appear first in the web\nbrowser\u2019s results. This method of identifying sources does not incorporate the rigor\nneeded to conduct good open-source intelligence analysis. Great analysts seek to identify\nthe \nbest\n sources pertinent to their topic. They seek to incorporate the greatest classified\nraw intelligence and the best open-source intelligence. Above all, analysts verify the\nveracity of their sources. They determine whether the source is unduly biased or\ninaccurate. If a source is unreliable, they do not use it in their writing, or they heavily\ncaveat the source by alerting the reader to the source\u2019s possible unreliability.\nWhen putting together sources for a writing assignment, analysts should question the\ncredibility\n of all the information they come across. Even products written by so-called\nexperts can be misleading or wrong; analysts should verify beforehand that the sources\nand the conclusions within the sources they use are legitimate. In an ideal world,\nmultiple sources would corroborate conclusions. Unfortunately, the nature of\nintelligence analysis means that sometimes analysts will have to rely on questionable or\nsparse source material. Despite the need to verify sources, sometimes the needed\ninformation simply is not there, or it is not there in totality. Because of this, analysts\noften reach certain judgments; however, some judgments are more strongly supported\nby evidence than others. NIEs and other intelligence products incorporate \nconfidence\nlevels\n. Thus, analysts make judgments and subsequently indicate whether they possess a\nhigh\n, \nmoderate\n, or \nlow\n level of confidence in their conclusions. This alerts policymakers\nto how sure the analyst is regarding what they are saying. Indicating confidence levels is\ncrucial to intelligence writing; otherwise, policymakers may take for granted that the\nanalysts\u2019 judgments are all well supported by intelligence. Policymakers often see only\nthe analysts\u2019 conclusions; they do not see the amount or credibility of information\nsupporting those conclusions. To make it clearer for policymakers, intelligence analysts\nmust indicate their confidence levels.\nIn addition to confidence levels, analysts also use \nestimative language\n to convey the\nlikelihood that something will happen. This is different from confidence levels because\nhere the analyst is not saying how confident they are in their sources or their\n295\ninformation; rather, they are saying how likely something is to happen or not.\nTo illustrate, consider an analyst who is investigating whether a country\u2019s leader is in\ngood health and whether the leader is likely to die within the \nnext year. The analyst may\nhave a human intelligence (HUMINT) report from a source whose reliability is either not\ngood or has yet to be established; the HUMINT source may report that the leader is in\nthe final stages of battling cancer and has fewer than six months to live. Thus, the source\nsays the leader is very likely to die. The analyst, however, is unable to substantiate the\nHUMINT source\u2019s claim. It\u2019s possible that aside from the HUMINT source and a few\nrecent photos of the leader, showing weight loss and apparent frailty, the analysts will\nhave little to help them conclude the current health state of the leader. Therefore, an\nanalyst might judge only with moderate confidence that the leader will soon die, based\non the scarcity and unreliability of their sources. Because an unreliable source has\nindicated that the leader is very likely to die within the next six months, the analyst\nwould say there is a likely chance the leader will pass away in the next month but caveat\nthat estimative likelihood by also indicating his confidence level in that likelihood. Thus,\nthe analyst would write that they have moderate confidence that the leader will die\nwithin the next year.\nFinally, good intelligence writing must include analysis. Novice intelligence writers\nmake the mistake of merely describing a situation without providing any real analysis or\ninterpretation. Analytical judgments are crucial to intelligence work; no matter how well\nwritten an intelligence product is, if it fails to convey meaningful analysis, it will likely\nbe of limited utility to decision-makers. Analysts cannot merely describe a situation.\nInstead, they must cull, from the many sources available, the most relevant information\nthat will allow them to draw conclusions. Then, they must take the information and\nprovide new insights into the subject matter. Analysts cannot merely describe the\nimportant information available to them; rather, they must make sense of the\ninformation and answer the underlying \u201cso what\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d questions. Analysts do not\nsimply retell the contents of raw intelligence or relay the history of a certain topic;\nrather, they interpret the meaning of the information in light of the policymaker\u2019s needs.\nThey provide the framework for policy-makers to understand the big picture. Effective\nintelligence writing incorporates sophisticated analysis and interpretation. To learn more\nabout analysis, see \nChapters 5\n (\u201cBarriers to Analysis\u201d) and 6 (\u201cAnalytical Methods\u201d).\nWhen reviewing their reports, analysts should make certain that they have gone beyond\ndescription and included their own analysis.\nGood Versus Bad Intelligence Writing\nIn the past, certain analytical products have not fully aided policymakers and military\nleaders in making decisions. The IC\u2019s 2002 Iraq NIE is a prime example of a poorly\nsupported intelligence product. The NIE concluded that \nIraq was \u201creconstituting its\nnuclear program.\u201d In the first paragraph of the NIE, analysts concluded in BLUF form\n296\n(National Intelligence Council, 2002):\nIraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in defiance of UN resolutions and\nrestrictions. Baghdad has chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN\nrestrictions; if left unchecked, it will probably have a nuclear weapon during this decade.\nUnfortunately, in the Iraq NIE, analysts relied on outdated and unreliable sources. Only\none primary source claimed that Iraq had restarted its nuclear program, but the source\nwas unreliable. Several years later, a Senate report concluded \u201cthe Defense HUMINT\nService (DHS) demonstrated serious lapses in its handling of the HUMINT source code\nnamed CURVE BALL, who was the principal source behind the IC\u2019s assessments that\nIraq had a mobile biological weapons program\u201d (Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence, 2004: 26). Additionally, the analysts who wrote the NIE assumed from the\nbeginning that Iraq had WMDs. They used the available evidence to support this\nconclusion. A better approach would have been if the analysts had first asked whether\nIraq had WMDs and then looked to see which answer the evidence supported. Since the\npublication of the Iraq NIE, the IC has changed the way it writes NIEs. Today, the CIA\u2019s\nNational Clandestine Service, which coordinates the capturing of HUMINT, must verify\nany human sources used to support conclusions drawn in an NIE. Such a review is\nintended to mitigate the use of unreliable sources (Bruno & Otterman, 2008).\nSince the Iraq NIE, the IC has encouraged analysts to incorporate more \nalternative\nanalysis\n. Rather than assuming that their conclusions are correct, analysts must consider\nother valid possibilities. Consider a court case\u2014 most cases that end up in court can be\nargued in two different ways. The prosecution or plaintiff has their own version of the\nstory and the defense, another. Both sides discuss roughly the same set of events or\npeople. Yet, they subscribe to very different interpretations. In the same way, intelligence\nis not clear-cut. Often, intelligence writing relies on speculation\u2014analysts may believe\nthat something is a certain way, but they rarely have irrefutable evidence to prove their\nconclusion one way or the other. Therefore, when writing an intelligence report, analysts\nmust also consider the counterarguments to everything they write. From there, they\nmust address, and if possible, dismiss those counterarguments. Perhaps there are\nweaknesses in the analysts\u2019 arguments or conclusions. Instead of weakening the analysts\u2019\nargument, showing that one has considered alternative viewpoints will actually\nstrengthen one\u2019s analytical writing by demonstrating that the analyst has taken all\npossible explanations into account.\nIn 2007, the IC exhibited caution when it drafted an NIE about Iran\u2019s nuclear\ncapabilities, a written product that has earned the reputation as the most rigorous NIE\nwritten by the IC up to that time (see \nBox 11.1\n). Unlike the Iraq NIE, which was written\nin three weeks and involved poor inter-agency collaboration, the Iran NIE involved\nlengthy coordination from all 17 intelligence agencies. The final product is 140 pages\nlong and includes extensive footnotes, indicating sources as well as a great deal of\nalternative analysis.\n297\nBox 11.1\n \nExcerpt from the Iran NIE: What we Mean\nwhen we Say: An Explanation of Estimative Language\nWe use phrases such as we judge, we assess, and we estimate\u2014and probabilistic\nterms such as probably and likely\u2014to convey analytical assessments and judgments.\nSuch statements are not facts, proof, or knowledge. These assessments and\njudgments generally are based on collected information, which often is incomplete\nor fragmentary. Some assessments are built on previous judgments. In all cases,\nassessments and judgments are not intended to imply that we have \u201cproof\u201d that\nshows something to be a fact or that definitively links two items or issues.\nIn addition to conveying judgments rather than certainty, our estimative\nlanguage also often conveys (1) our assessed likelihood or probability of an event,\nand (2) the level of confidence we ascribe to the judgment.\nEstimates of Likelihood\nBecause analytical judgments are not certain, we use probabilistic language to\nreflect the Community\u2019s estimates of the likelihood of developments or events.\nTerms such as probably, likely, very likely, or almost certainly indicate a greater\nthan even chance. The terms unlikely and remote indicate a less than even chance\nthat an event will occur; they do not imply that an event will not occur. Terms such\nas might or may reflect situations in which we are unable to assess the likelihood,\ngenerally because relevant information is unavailable, sketchy, or fragmented.\nTerms such as we cannot dismiss, we cannot rule out, or we cannot discount reflect\nan unlikely, improbable, or remote event whose consequences are such that it\nwarrants mentioning. The chart provides a rough idea of the relationship of some of\nthese terms to each other.\nRemote\u2014Very Unlikely\u2014Unlikely\u2014Even Chance\u2014Probably/Likely\u2014Very likely\u2014\nAlmost certainly.\nConfidence in Assessments\nOur assessments and estimates are supported by information that varies in scope,\nquality, and sourcing. Consequently, we ascribe high, moderate, or low levels of\nconfidence to our assessments, as follows:\nHigh confidence generally indicates that our judgments are based on high-\nquality information, and/or that the nature of the issue makes it possible to\nrender a solid judgment. A \u201chigh confidence\u201d judgment is not a fact or a\n298\ncertainty, however, and such judgments still carry a risk of being wrong.\nModerate confidence generally means that the information is credibly\nsourced and plausible but not of sufficient quality or corroborated\nsufficiently to warrant a higher level of confidence.\nLow confidence generally means that the information\u2019s credibility and/or\nplausibility is questionable, or that the information is too fragmented or\npoorly corroborated to make solid analytical inferences, or that we have\nsignificant concerns or problems with the sources.\nSource:\n National Intelligence Council.

Intelligence analysts write to a specific audience\u2014\ndecision-makers\u2014and it is imperative that intelligence analysts write well. To write\nintelligence products that decision-makers can easily read, there are several principles\nthat intelligence analysts must follow.\nFirst, analysts should write in short, easy-to-read paragraphs. Each paragraph should\nhave a \ntopic sentence\n that conveys the main idea; analysts should convey one main idea\nwith each paragraph. Each paragraph\u2019s topic sentence should be followed by three to\nfive more sentences of exposition. If a policymaker has only enough time to read the first\nsentence of each paragraph in an analyst\u2019s paper, those first sentences alone should\nprovide enough information for the policymaker to understand the subject. Analysts\nshould use the topic sentence to summarize the point they wish to make in that\nparagraph. The topic sentence is that paragraph\u2019s BLUF.\nIntelligence analysts must also understand and properly apply the rules of grammar.\nIntelligence agencies today lament the poor writing quality of applicants. One\u2019s inability\nto write has disqualified countless candidates \nfrom receiving intelligence analyst\npositions. One of the most helpful things an aspiring analyst can do to write better is to\nregularly review a good grammar book. Even good writers can benefit from a refresher.\nReviewing grammar rules can elicit nausea from most people, but the rules are non-\nnegotiable when it comes to producing a well-written product. Analysts write for a\nliving; therefore, their ability to use the proper words constitutes their tradecraftand\nsubsequently, their career reputation. The following paragraphs briefly review issues\ncommonly found in student or entry-level analytic writing.\nSentence Structure\n299\nAlthough the best writers sometimes break grammar and writing rules on purpose (and\noften receive critical acclaim for the ingenuity of doing so\u2014consider William Faulkner\u2019s\nstream-of-consciousness writing and lack of punctuation), the rest of us do well to abide\nby the grammar rules in an effort to keep ourselves from sounding ridiculous. Writers\nwalk a tightrope in balancing the use of their own style and voice. Because intelligence\nproducts go to policy-makers and high-level intelligence authorities, analysts should use\na level of formality that precludes casualness, both in style and in tone. In the following\nsections, we discuss a few grammar mistakes common to students\u2019 writing.\nThe Active Voice\nNotice the difference between the two sentences:\nActive: Tom caught the ball.\nPassive: The ball was caught by Tom.\nThe active version of the sentence bursts with motion and forgoes the pesky \u201cto be\u201d verb\n\u201cwas.\u201d Young children in grade school learn to omit \u201cto be\u201d verbs such as am, is, are,\nwas, were, be, being, been. They are not encouraged to omit \u201cto be\u201d verbs simply because\nEnglish teachers do not like them; rather, they eliminate those words because they often\nstand in the way of writing in the active voice. Using to-be verbs causes writers to defer\nto passive voice and craftwordy sentences such as \u201cThe brilliant intelligence report was\nwritten by Sarah\u201d or \u201cThe car was driven by a sixteen year old lunatic.\u201d Instead, writers\nshould state, \u201cSarah wrote the brilliant intelligence report\u201d or \u201cThe sixteen year old\nlunatic drove the car.\u201d\nAdditionally, too many \u201cto be\u201d verbs lead to wordy sentences:\nWordy\u2014There were many monkeys dangling from the agent\u2019s car once he finally found his way out of the\njungle.\nRevised\u2014The agent emerged from the jungle and discovered monkeys dangling from his car.\nIdentifying Agents\nProviding clarity about agents makes a decision-maker\u2019s job easier. Consider the\nfollowing sentence:\nTo get from the United States to France, an airplane must be flown.\nThis sentence starts with an infinitive\u2014\u201cto get.\u201d Unfortunately for the reader, the\nsentence does not name an actor. Such an omission makes the sentence sound terribly\ntheoretical and abstract; this is a sentence with generalized advice directed toward no\none. To make this a better sentence, the writer should identify an agent:\nTo get from the United States to France,\n \nyou\n \nmust fly on an airplane.\n300\nThe identification of the actor\u2014you\u2014makes for a better sentence because the reader now\nknows the person to whom the sentence refers.\nCommas\nThe rules regarding comma usage are fairly simple. In the first place, compound\nsentences separated by a conjunction (and, or, but) need a comma.\nExample: \nWe write every day, and we research as well.\nBut for the \u201cand,\u201d there would be two separate sentences or what English teachers\nrefer to as \u201cindependent clauses\u201d: \nWe write every day. We research as well.\nWhen joining the two independent clauses into one compound sentence through the\nuse of the conjunction \u201cand,\u201d the writer must use a comma. Conversely, sentences that\ncontain a conjunction without two independent clauses generally do not need a comma\nbefore the conjunction.\nExample: \nWe write every day and research as well.\nThis sentence contains an independent clause, a conjunction, and a dependent clause.\n\u201cResearch as well\u201d cannot stand on its own. Therefore, no comma is needed before the\nconjunction \u201cand.\u201d\nThere are other rules for commas as well; prospective analysts and collectors should\nconsult grammar books to ensure that they are aware of correct structure and usage.\nNeedless Words\nStrunk and White\u2019s classic grammar book \nThe Elements of Style\n made this phrase famous\namong writers (Strunk & White, 2000):\nVigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary\nsentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary\nparts. This requires not that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects only in\noutline, but that every word tell.\nThe last part of Strunk\u2019s quotation, \u201cthat every word tell,\u201d is particularly applicable to\nintelligence writing. Intelligence analysts write for policymakers who are under a great\ndeal of pressure and time constraints. Chances are, if an analyst composes a long report,\nthe policymaker will read only the main points necessary for making a decision. Thus,\nclarity, conciseness, and brevity are critical to intelligence writing. Analysts must make\neach word count and eliminate the words that do not.\nUnlike English classes where students are tasked to fill a certain number of pages,\nintelligence analysts face a completely different problem. Oftentimes, they have to distill\nenormous amounts of information down to a couple of pages or even a couple of\n301\nparagraphs. Analysts use their judgment to determine the most crucial information\nrelevant to the policymaker\u2019s needs. They consider their audience, asking what their\nreader needs to know. Then, they construct a report that speaks precisely to the\npolicymaker\u2019s needs with no more words than are necessary.\nReading Level of the Analytic Piece\nSome writers mistakenly think they sound smarter if their writing is excessively wordy\nor if they use a lot of big words. Unfortunately, their attempts at sounding smart make\ntheir writing laborious to read, and the writers themselves sound pretentious. Many\nintelligence agencies gauge the readability of analysts\u2019 works by grading them on the\nFlesch\n and \nFlesch\u2013Kincaid reading scales\n, which determine a written product\u2019s grade\nlevel. Analysts are encouraged to write at a grade-level comparable to that found in\nmajor news publications such as \nTime\n or \nU.S. News and World Report\n; IC analytic\ntraining courses push students to write at a grade level of 10\u201313. Writing instructors\ndiscourage analysts from writing with too much complexity because it precludes a\npolicymaker from being able to read and make sense of the work quickly. Analysts need\nto remove ambiguity, not add to it. Policymakers should be able to read an analyst\u2019s\nwork one time and glean all \nthe information they need. If the document is excessively\nverbose and takes more than one reading to comprehend, the analyst has not written a\ngood intelligence product. Popular novelist Stephen King encouraged readers to skip\nostentatious vocabulary and instead use the first words that come to mind (King, 2000):\nOne of the really bad things you can do to your writing is to dress up the vocabulary, looking for long words\nbecause you\u2019re maybe a little bit ashamed of your short ones. This is like dressing up a household pet in evening\nclothes. The pet is embarrassed and the person who committed this act of premeditated cuteness should be even\nmore embarrassed. Make yourself a solemn promise right now that you\u2019ll never use \u2018emolument\u2019 when you\nmean \u2018tip.\u2019\nWhen writing a product for a policymaker, writers should forgo the words that make\nthem sound the \u201csmartest\u201d and instead use the simplest words that say what they mean\nto say.\nSimple writing includes limiting the use of adjectives and adverbs. This is not to say\nthat writers should eliminate \nall\n of their adjectives and adverbs; used the proper way,\nthose words can add color and depth to writing. Adjectives and adverbs used to excess\nweaken the writing. Adjectives describe nouns and adverbs describe verbs; if one uses\nproper nouns and verbs in the first place, there will be no need to qualify them with as\nmany adjectives and adverbs. Most of the time, adjectives and adverbs are superfluous:\nExample: \nHer hands trembled as she timidly called her attorney.\nIn this sentence, it is grammatically acceptable to use the word \u201ctimidly.\u201d When\n\u201ctimidly\u201d is read within the context of the sentence, however, it becomes unnecessary.\nThe verb \u201ctrembled\u201d already indicates that the caller is frightened. The sentence would\n302\nread better if it merely said, \u201cHer hands trembled as she called her attorney.\u201d Similarly,\nintelligence analysts should resist burying their verbs and nouns in layers of adjectives\nand adverbs. Instead of saying \u201cNarnia\u2019s fierce, huge, and easily adaptable military\nforces are capable of beating Middle Earth\u2019s scrawny army any day,\u201d a writer could\nconvey the same message in simpler form by writing \u201cNarnia\u2019s military forces surpass\nthose of Middle Earth.\u201d The sentence is shorter, easier to read, and conveys the same\nmessage as the longer version.\nThe Writing Process\nAfter intelligence analysts have outlined what they wish to say, they face the difficult\ntask of putting their thoughts to paper. Novelist Anne Lamott \npreaches the importance of\novercoming perfectionism to write a first draft(Lamott, 1994): \u201cAlmost all good writing\nbegins with terrible first efforts. You need to start somewhere. Start by getting something\n\u2014anything\u2014down on paper.\u201d\nFew analysts are skilled enough to write a good intelligence product on the first draft.\nChances are, they will write a first draftand edit at least two or three times. For the first\ndraft, analysts should write with as few inhibitions as possible. The first draftis the time\nto get words onto paper. Analysts should wait to clean up their writing until the revision\nphase.\nDuring the \nrevision\n process, analysts should pay careful attention to the logic of their\nanalysis, making sure their reasoning and conclusions are sound. They should tighten\ntheir writing by correcting grammar and punctuation mistakes and omitting any extra\nwords. Many analysts use a peer review process to revise their work; by having other\nanalysts read their products, they can catch mistakes they would have otherwise missed.\nAlthough intelligence analysts are certainly not novelists, they write for a living and\nhave an audience that may or may not pay attention to what is being written. The IC\npublishes scores of reports and other intelligence documents; there is no guarantee that\nan analyst\u2019s work will ever be read by the intended audience. Thus, analysts should\nwrite as well as they possibly can. To write well, one must read well. Intelligence\nanalysts have a voracious and steady reading diet of international news received from\nthe best sources possible. They regularly read reports about their subject areas in order to\nretain familiarity with their field.\n303\nBriefing\nWriting well is roughly half the battle; analysts also spend a good bit of time briefing\ntheir findings to decision-makers.\nBriefings generally follow the BLUF format of written products: Briefers give their\nBLUF and make sure the policymaker understands why the briefing is applicable to\nthem. If an analyst gives a recurring briefing, he or she will take into account the\npolicymaker\u2019s past concerns and interests as well as the content of prior briefings.\nIntelligence analysts who regularly brief the same policymakers and senior leaders over\nlong periods of time often admit that they can eventually anticipate most of the\nquestions they receive. Good analysts know that their briefing is intended to meet the\nneeds of the policymaker. They approach a briefing as an opportunity to help a\npolicymaker fully understand a particular issue.\nBasics of Public Speaking\nGood intelligence briefers understand the fundamentals of public speaking. Until\nanalysts find their speaking style and becomes comfortable speaking in front of others,\nthey require a lot of practice.\nMost people who have spoken in front of audiences for a long time (long is relative in\nthis case; for some, it can be several months, whereas for others it can be several years)\nnaturally do the things that good speakers do. They speak clearly and articulate their\nwords, speaking neither too fast nor too slow. They speak with confidence and maintain\neye contact with their audience members. Their presentation is organized; many IC\nagencies insist that briefers use some sort of presentation software, such as PowerPoint,\nwhich generally helps speakers organize their thoughts. However, there is no shortcut\nfor becoming a good briefer; generally, it is a matter of practice, practice, and practice.\nAnalysts can hone their speaking skills by doing several things. First, they may\nprepare for a presentation by rehearsing alone. They do this to become comfortable\nstanding and speaking while using slides. In practice, analysts might also videotape\nthemselves while speaking; this will let them see exactly how their presentation looks to\ntheir audience. By watching themselves during playback, they see themselves do things\nthey did not know they did. By digitally speeding up the video, their distracting ticks\nwill become instantly clear\u2014they will see themselves put their hair behind their ear 30\ntimes in a five-minute presentation, use nervous hand gestures, shifttheir weight from\none foot to the other, or sway back and forth.\nWhen analysts watch themselves speak, they should also beware of their use of \u201cuh\u201d\nand \u201cuhm.\u201d Some speech teachers will hold up a sign each time a student uses \u201cuh\u201d or\n304\n\u201cuhm\u201d to help make them aware of when they say it. For those who struggle to speak\nclearly, they can try practicing in front of a friend who will alert them each time they\nuse a filler word. Analysts can also do their best to refrain from using \u201cuh\u201d and \u201cuhm\u201d in\neveryday speech, making every effort to cleanse their vocabulary of those words.\nWhen looking at the video, analysts should pay attention to their body movements.\nGood speakers have good posture and stand up straight with their shoulders back.\nAnalysts should refrain from fidgeting and plant their feet firmly on the ground. When\nanalysts speak from behind a podium, they should rest their hands gently on the podium\nand refrain from \u201cdriving\u201d or gripping the podium on its sides. When analysts stand and\nspeak without a podium, they should rest their hands comfortably at their sides.\nAnalysts should resist the temptation to pace back and forth in front of their audience. If\nthey do move, they might move during the presentation\u2019s transitions from one point to\nanother. Analysts should resist putting their hands behind their \nback or in their pockets,\nas such stances can come across as smug and overly casual.\nAnalysts must also remember to relax and breathe. A popular myth holds that most\npeople are more afraid of public speaking than death; although this may not be true,\nmany individuals would no doubt classify themselves as \nglossophobic\n (afraid of speaking\nbefore groups). If analysts fear speaking in public, they must muster extra determination\nto become a good speaker. They will allow for extra practice. As they continue speaking,\ntheir presentation skills improve, and over time they feel less anxious about speaking.\nTo present well, analysts must clearly \narticulate\n their words and speak at a\ncomfortable volume appropriate to the size of their venue. No one likes to strain their\nears to hear a speaker; alternatively, no audience likes to feel as if the speaker is yelling\nat them. Experienced briefers will know how to modulate their delivery and find a\nhappy level at which to speak. They will also pay attention to the rate of their speech,\nusing video rehearsals and their colleagues\u2019 feedback to determine if they speak too fast\nor too slow. Analysts also learn to insert pauses throughout their speeches as they\ntransition from point to point; brief respites give the audience time to digest the\nspeaker\u2019s message.\nBriefing Preparation\nIntelligence analysts conduct several types of briefings. Sometimes, they are called to\ngive a \none-time briefing\n to a policymaker. Other times, they give \nrecurring briefings\nto the same audience members. Analysts\u2019 individual situations dictate how they prepare\nfor their briefing. If they give a briefing every day to the same policymaker, they will\neventually decrease their level of preparation. This is not to say they will not continue to\nprepare diligently for their presentation. The preparation in the earlier briefings,\nhowever, allows them to focus more clearly on details related to recent events rather\nthan background information. They will retain familiarity with their subject matter,\ntheir briefing skills will remain well-oiled since they brief every day, and because they\n305\nhave to prepare a briefing with frequency, they will be hard pressed to find the time to\nput in a full, daily dress rehearsal. Many experienced briefers outline on paper what they\nwish to say beforehand, and, if time allows, practice saying their presentation aloud once\nor twice before they present. Some have reached a point where they no longer rehearse\naloud. Understand, however, that this is not where the novice speaker starts. The best\nbriefers did not become accomplished without years of practice and preparation. Until\nthey gain experience, they dedicate as much time as they need to prepare and practice\ntheir presentation beforehand. As chance favors the prepared mind, so does it favor the\nprepared briefer.\nIn addition to having a solid, substantive presentation, analysts should also research\ntheir audience beforehand. An analyst will ideally know as much as they can about their\npolicymaker as well as what the policymaker cares about and needs to know. Just as\nanalysts tailor analytical papers to their audience, analysts likewise tailor their\npresentation. A good analyst will do his or her best to determine a policymaker\u2019s\npreferences. For example, an analyst should try to discern whether their policymaker\nlikes slide presentations and adjust their presentation accordingly. Analysts should\ndetermine beforehand how much time they have to speak and decide if the allotted time\nis adequate for making their point. If the time is too short or too long, analysts may try\nto adjust the time according to their needs. Once the time is set, however, analysts must\nplan to stay comfortably within the set limit. Busy policymakers will not appreciate a\npresentation that extends past its allotted time. If an analyst has more time than needed,\nhe or she may end the briefing early instead of inserting needless \u201cfiller\u201d information.\nBefore analysts decide that they do not have enough information to fill their briefing\ntime, however, they should ensure that they have adequately assessed their topic and\nthat they do not need to conduct extra research.\nBefore analysts present, they should outline on paper exactly what they wish to say.\nThey should begin by introducing themselves and telling their policy-maker the subject\nof their presentation. After their introduction, the speaker should briefly tell the\naudience what they plan to discuss and then follow their introduction with their BLUF.\nGood analysts provide the main conclusion of their presentation at the beginning and\nfollow with supporting evidence. Before analysts end their presentations, they should\nsummarize what they presented, remind their audience once more of the BLUF, and\nconclude.\nRather than creating an outline and speaking off the cuff, some people prefer to write\nout their presentation word for word and memorize. Most analysts, however, do not do\nthis. Writing out a speech and memorizing may work for a college speech class, but it\nwill likely end disastrously in the \u201creal world.\u201d Giving a memorized speech often sounds\nrehearsed and unnatural. An intelligence briefing is not a theater performance; rather, a\nbriefing allows an analyst to engage a policymaker in conversation to provide greater\nunderstanding. Even if analysts have the time to memorize a speech and sound halfway\nnatural when they recite it, they risk drawing a blank and ruining their entire\npresentation. When analysts must rely on their memory to recite a speech, one forgotten\n306\nword can destroy a presentation; this can become a problem when a policymaker\ninterrupts to ask a question, causing the analyst to forget his or her place in the\npresentation.\nWhen analysts present slides, they \nmust\n refrain from reading the slides to the\npolicymaker. Instead, they should refer to their slides but also have a \npresentation\nseparate from the slides\u2019 text. When designing a slideshow, analysts should use a neutral\nbackground template that does not distract from the overall message. They should use\nplain fonts written in one color, preferably black or dark blue; however, if they use a\ndark background template, they should consider making their text white for ease of\nreading. The text must be large enough to read from a distance. Briefers may also use\ngraphics such as maps, charts, or pictures that pertain to the presentation. Informative\ngraphics, when used well, can aid a policymaker\u2019s understanding.\nAnalysts should aim to include no more than two or three main points on one slide.\nThey should refrain from overloading any slides with too much text, remembering that\nless is more. Additionally, analysts should avoid making too many slides. Analysts will\nusually spend at least a few minutes discussing each slide. It is often a good idea to\ncreate several detailed backup slides in case the policymaker wishes to delve into some\ndetails related to the presentation. For example, the analyst may wish to include a slide\ndetailing their use of an analytic method. Analysts should place the backup slides at the\nend of the slideshow presentation, and if a policymaker requests additional detail,\nanalysts may flip forward to their backup slides and return to their regular presentation\nonce they have answered the policymaker\u2019s questions.\nAnalysts should carry a printed version of their slides so that if their presentation does\nnot work, they can refer to their hard copy. They should also save their presentation in\nseveral different formats; if they have a newer version of software, they should save\ntheir slides in a format compatible with older software versions.\nFinally, analysts should dress professionally for their presentation, forgoing a trendy\nlook in favor of a conservative suit or dress, preferably in one of the \u201cpower colors\u201d such\nas gray, black, navy, or brown. To ensure they look appropriate, analysts should ensure\nthat their clothes are pressed and tailored to fit. Importantly, every agency has its own\nculture, which determines the appropriateness of behavior, demeanor, and dress.\nAnalysts must understand the culture of their audience. Failure to do so will result in\nalienation and, ultimately, a dismissal of whatever the analyst has to say.\nWhen analysts arrive at their briefing, they should bring a notepad so that they can\nmake notes as the policymaker asks questions; having the notepad with them as they\npresent allows analysts to capture the essence of their policymaker\u2019s questions to\nproperly answer them.\nThe Briefing\nAnalysts should arrive at their briefing early. They do not want to appear flustered or\n307\nout of breath when they give their presentation. Before speaking, \nthey should have one\nlast look-over in a mirror, ensuring that they do not have food in their teeth or\nsomething spilled on their clothes. When they arrive at their destination, they should\nfigure out where their policymaker will sit and determine where they should stand. If\nthey use slides, they should position themselves so that they can look at both the\npolicymaker and the screen without turning their back. If they brief alongside another\ncolleague, they should ensure that each presenter can see the other\u2019s face.\nMost importantly, analysts must be confident; how they say something is as important\nas what they say. They should begin their presentation by introducing themselves,\nremaining at all times respectful and deferential toward the policymaker.\nNo matter how much preparation analysts perform beforehand, their briefing may go\ndifferently than planned. Good briefers learn to \u201cgo with the flow\u201d and answer the\npolicymaker\u2019s questions using a formal but relaxed speaking style. When the\npolicymaker begins to ask a question, briefers should immediately stop talking and\nlisten. When speaking, they should avoid using slang or lingo. If anything goes wrong\nduring their presentation\u2014the PowerPoint does not work, they botch something they\nhad planned to say, they do not know the answer to a question a policymaker asks them\n\u2014analysts should not give excuses. Rather, they should quickly apologize and move on\nas best they can.\nPolicymakers may bring their colleagues to the briefing. Despite the audience, analysts\nmust remember to direct their presentation to the policymaker. During the briefing,\nanalysts should pay attention. If a policymaker looks bored or if their eyes begin to glaze\nover and they appear to lose interest, analysts should respond accordingly. Perhaps they\nshould move to another slide or quicken their pace. If their policymaker appears\nconfused, the analyst may need to explain it in greater detail or explain it in a simpler\nway so that the policymaker understands.\nAnalysts should prepare for the policymaker to ask many questions or no questions at\nall. They should prepare a presentation that fills the entire allotted time while\nanticipating that the policymaker may ask questions that take the analyst in a new\ndirection. Analysts should strive to answer the policymaker\u2019s questions, but if the\npolicymaker diverts to a tangent, the analyst should gently direct the briefing back to its\nintended purpose.\nOccasionally, a policymaker may ask a question for which an analyst does not have an\nanswer. When this happens, and it will, analysts should not bluff their way through an\nanswer. Instead, they should inform the policymakers that they will get back to them\nwith an answer. First year students at the U.S. Naval Academy are not permitted to use\nthe phrase \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked a question by an upperclassman. Instead, they\nmust reply \u201cI\u2019ll find out, sir (ma\u2019am).\u201d This is good advice for briefers as well.\nSome analysts have complained of being held hostage in hostile briefing situations.\nSometimes, policymakers will use a briefing opportunity as a chance to confirm their\npolicy agenda. Such a policymaker shows no concern for the analyst\u2019s message but\nrather aims to get the analyst to say what the policy-maker wants to hear. If the analyst\n308\nbelieves the policymaker is asking leading questions and not allowing the analyst to\nconvey their judgments, the analyst should try as best they can to convey their point.\nAnalysts should not allow a policymaker to warp or twist their judgments based on the\nlimited questions they purposefully ask. If a policymaker fails to ask the right questions,\nan analyst may politely mention what other factors the policymaker might consider.\nAnalysts must also ensure, however, that they do not mistakenly delve into a\npolicymaker\u2019s territory. Analysts provide policymakers with information needed to make\na decision. They discuss the ramifications of each possible decision but leave it to the\npolicymaker to make the final decision.\nAnalysts have the mighty responsibility of providing nonpoliticized and objective\nanalysis. As discussed earlier in the book, the briefer may be the only one in the room\nwilling or able to tell the policymaker \u201cthe way it is.\u201d Some call this \nspeaking truth to\npower\n, and it can require a great deal of courage. As Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning journalist\nHerbert Agar once said, \u201cThe truth that makes men free is for the most part the truth\nwhich men prefer not to hear\u201d (Agar, 1942).\n309\nConclusion\nWriting and briefing for the IC demands a certain form of communication from analysts.\nThe guidelines in this chapter are a starting point for understanding analytical writing\nand briefing. Each intelligence agency has its own style, which analysts must follow, and\nonce an agency hires an analyst they learn to write and brief in the style of their\norganization. Several key principles, however, pertain to intelligence writing and\nbriefing regardless of the agency or circumstance. Writing concisely, using a BLUF\nformat, and speaking to meet the decision-maker\u2019s needs are universally useful skills in\nthe world of intelligence.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nWhat are the most important elements of intelligence writing?\n2\n. \nHow does an analyst write something that will gain the decision-maker\u2019s\nattention?\n3\n. \nHow does an analyst decide what type of intelligence product he or she should\nwrite?\n4\n. \nHow should novice intelligence briefers prepare for an upcoming presentation?\n5\n. \nHow does an analyst avoid entering into the realm of policymaking when\nbriefing?\n310\nKey Terms\nActive voice\nAlternative analysis\nArgument\nArticulate\nBasic intelligence\nBottom line up front (BLUF)\nConfidence levels\nNational Intelligence Estimate (NIE)\nOne-time briefing\nPresident\u2019s Daily Brief (PDB)\nRecurring briefing\nRevision\nCredibility\nDaily intelligence\nEstimative intelligence\nEstimative language\nFlesch\u2013Flesch Kincaid reading scales\nIn-depth reports\nJudgments\nSpeaking truth to power\nStrategic\nTactical\nTitle\nTopic sentence\nWarning intelligence\n311\nReferences\nAgar, H.

Military operations in support of\nintelligence efforts and intelligence efforts supporting the military have proven to be a\ncontinually evolving partnership.\nFrom a military perspective, commanders want the same thing that policymakers and\nbusiness leaders crave\u2014actionable intelligence. In the military setting, the need to gain\naccurate and timely information of the enemy\u2019s intent and its capabilities plays a critical\nrole in operational planning, operational decision-making, and ultimately success in the\noperational environment.\nUntil the last half of the twentieth century, U.S. intelligence efforts largely fell to the\nmilitary. For example, the first two permanent intelligence organizations, the Office of\nNaval Intelligence (ONI) and the Army\u2019s Military Intelligence Division (later named the\nMilitary Intelligence Corps), were both run by the military. In the early days, even when\na civilian agency became involved with intelligence, a branch of the military usually\nserved as a partner; readers will recall that the Black Chamber, fully described in\nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d), was a joint State Department\u2013\nArmy venture.\nAlthough much military intelligence closely resembles what is produced by agencies\nsuch as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), there are several distinct differences,\nwhich we highlight in this chapter.\n315\nPurpose of Military Intelligence\nWorld War II German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel once proclaimed that, \u201cIt is not that\none general is more brilliant or experienced than the other; it is a question of which\ngeneral has a better appreciation of the battlefield\u201d (Rommel, 1953). In other words,\nbattlefield success can, in large measure, be a matter of the advantage conveyed through\nsuperior intelligence. Rommel himself is a perfect example of this: much of his success in\nNorth Africa was achieved though the effective use of intelligence.\nHistorically, each branch of the service produced its own intelligence for its own use\u2014\nfor example, during World War II, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) provided fleet\ncommanders with intelligence designed to produce victory at sea, while the Army\nconcentrated on battlefields in Europe and the South Pacific. Today, however, the\n\u201cbattlefield\u201d has changed and may include the ground, the air, under or above the sea,\nspace, and, increasingly, cyberspace. To meet this challenge, the military has introduced\nthe concept of \u201cjointness,\u201d where Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, and Coast Guard\npersonnel work side-by-side to produce intelligence that can be used by all. The \nquote\nfrom the beginning of this chapter provides a definition of intelligence, as found in the\npublication titled, \nJoint Intelligence\n, generally referred to as \nJoint Publication 2\u20130\n:\n\u201cIntelligence provides the commander a variety of assessments and estimates that\nfacilitate understanding the operational environment\u201d (Joint Publication 2\u20130, 2013: ix).\nAlthough commanders are responsible for command and control, they rely on their staff\nand subordinate commanders to transfer plans into action.\nOf course, military intelligence failures can be every bit as drastic as those of the\ncivilian world. In his discussion of the failure to prevent the Pearl Harbor attacks of 1941,\nhistorian David Kahn notes:\nThe naval commander at Pearl, Admiral Husband Kimmel, complained that he was taken by surprise in part\nbecause he had not been allowed to receive the diplomatic intelligence obtained from PURPLE. (Kahn, 1992: 148)\nPurple\n, of course, refers to a secret code that was used to encrypt Japanese\ncommunications before and during World War II. Like the German ULTRA code,\ncryptanalysts had succeeded in breaking it; Admiral Kimmel\u2019s judgment that having the\nPurple intercepts could have allowed him to prevent the attacks is both extraordinary\nand underscores the value that intelligence plays in the military world.\nFor the military commander, accurate intelligence of the enemy\u2019s intent helps to\nremove uncertainty and assists in lifting the \u201cfog of war\u201d; it may literally mean the\ndifference between success and failure. From the earliest days of warfare, military\nleaders have sought to gain an advantage over their enemies. Strength of forces, weapons\ntechnology, logistics, training, communications, and intelligence pertaining to the\nintention of the enemy and the ability of the commander combined with the boldness to\n316\nact all play a role in military operational success. Sun Tzu recognized the value of\nmilitary intelligence when he said:\n[I]t is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for\npurposes of spying and thereby they achieve great results. (Sun Tzu, n.d.)\n317\nTypes of Military Intelligence\nWe have previously discussed the definitions of tactical, strategic, and operational\nintelligence. Perhaps nowhere are these concepts more important than when dealing\nwith the operational environment. In other areas, the boundaries between strategic and\ntactical may blur; this tends to happen far less frequently when dealing with military\nintelligence.\nFigure 12.1\n During a drill, U.S. Army and Philippine soldiers aim a mortar based on tactical intelligence they\nhave received regarding the location of an enemy patrol. (Source: U.S. Army)\nTactical intelligence is used by warfighters for planning and conducting battles and\nengagements. It can range from something as simple as learning whether an enemy\ncolumn is over the next hill or as complicated as an adversary\u2019s movements over the\ncourse of several hours. Tactical intelligence addresses the threat across the range of\nmilitary operations and focuses on the adversary\u2019s capabilities, intentions, and\nvulnerabilities; it also helps understand the physical environment (\nFigure 12.1\n). Through\nits use, commanders hope to identify when, where, and in what strength the adversary\nwill conduct tactical level operations and to what desired end (why); thus prepared, the\noperational commander can use this insight to defeat the enemy.\nOperational intelligence is similar to tactical intelligence, but it is primarily used by\ncombatant commanders, subordinate joint force commanders, and their component\ncommanders to shape operations and identify evolving situations before they escalate. It\ncan also be used to mitigate impacts even if an enemy\u2019s efforts are successful.\n318\nAccording to \nJoint Publication 2\u20130\n, strategic intelligence consists of:\n[T]he national strategic intelligence produced for the President, the National Security Council, Congress,\nSecretary of Defense (SecDef), senior military \nleaders, combatant commanders (CCDRs), and other US\nGovernment departments and agencies, and theater strategic intelligence that supports joint operations across\nthe range of military operations, assesses the current situation, and estimates future capabilities and intentions of\nadversaries that could affect the national security and US or allied interests. (Joint Publication 2\u20130, 2013: x)\nIn other words, strategic intelligence is designed to give great insight into the big picture.\nIt is used to develop national strategy and policy, monitor the international situation,\nprepare military plans, determine major weapon systems and force structure\nrequirements, and conduct strategic operations. Intelligence products are helpful in\npreparing strategic estimates supporting theater strategy and security cooperation\nplanning.\n319\nCommand and Control\nCommand and control\n includes the making and executing of decisions. Understanding\nthe relationship between intelligence and command and control is key to understanding\nthe role of intelligence for military units.\nIntelligence is one element of the command function, as are logistics, operational\nplanning, and administration. Within the command staff is the intelligence section,\nwhich must be a viable, active, and effective component.\nTo support operational planning, intelligence strives to accomplish two objectives.\nFirst, intelligence must provide accurate, timely, and relevant knowledge about the\nenemy (or potential enemy) and the operational environment. Second, intelligence must\nassist in protecting friendly forces through counterintelligence (CI). Commanders cannot\nlose sight that the opponents are also striving to gain tactical and strategic advantages.\nIn a military context, CI includes both active and passive measures intended to deny\nthe enemy valuable information about the friendly situation and in some cases\nintentionally mislead him. CI also includes activities related to countering hostile\nespionage, subversion, and terrorism. In this way, it does not differ markedly from the\ndefinition of CI previously provided. However, offensive CI for the military is often\nkinetic\n. That is, it unfolds on the battlefield, and is designed to further the strategic\nbattle plan. Aficionados of military history may recall \nOperation Fortitude\n, a World\nWar II military deception designed to make the Germans think that allied forces were\npoised to invade Norway and Pas de Calais when, in fact, Normandy was their target.\nThe feint worked brilliantly, thus paving the way for a successful D-Day operation.\n320\nThe Military Intelligence Cycle\nThe military intelligence cycle is similar to the one presented in \nChapter 7\n (\u201cPutting It\nAll Together: The Intelligence Cycle\u201d), with a few exceptions. Instead of a six-step\nparallel process, military researcher Geraint Evans proposes one that consists of eight\nphases laid out as a \u201chub-and-spoke\u201d model. His model contains the following steps:\nPlanning\nDirection and Prioritisation [sic]\nCollection and Prioritisation [sic]\nProcessing\nAnalysis\nProduction\nDissemination\nReview\nAt the center of the \u201cwheel\u201d appears \u201ccontinuous assessment of the operational\nenvironment and commander\u2019s intent\u201d (Evans, 2009).\nReaders will note that, in the traditional model, planning and direction are combined\ninto a single step. In the Evans\u2019 model, they are distinct. Evans\u2019 \nPlanning\n phase consists\nof the commander\u2019s intent as well as some initial requirements; \nDirection and\nPrioritisation\n [sic] further refine the requirements and disperse them to appropriate\ncollectors. The division into two distinct phases underscores the hierarchical nature of\nmilitary organizations as well as the strict accountability that is part of military\ndiscipline. \nCollection\n, \nProcessing\n, and \nAnalysis\n serve roughly the same roles that they\ndo in the traditional model. Evans adds a step after the Analysis phase, which he terms\nProduction\n; this is the point at which the actual report is prepared. The report is\ndelivered in the \nDissemination\n phase, which also includes briefing where appropriate.\nIn the traditional model, Production is subsumed under analysis and dissemination.\nFinally, the intelligence undergoes \nReview\n, where it is evaluated to ensure that the\nquestions have been satisfactorily answered. This is also the phase at which it is decided\nwhether additional collection and analysis is necessary (see Evans, 2009).\nEvans also discusses an ongoing process where the operational environment and\ncommander\u2019s intent are considered at every step. This drives home the reality of the\never-changing operational environment, which must be constantly assessed; this further\nreminds every person involved that the goal of intelligence is to serve the commander\u2019s\nneeds. Intelligence that fails in this regard is of limited utility.\n321\nEvolution of Military Intelligence\nAs discussed in \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d), military\nintelligence has a rich history. Over the course of the past 200 years, its structure has\nshifted to meet the changing needs of commanders and the evolution of war.\nOn July 25, 1918, an American Intelligence School was created in Langres, France, to\nsupport the American Expeditionary Force. The Intelligence School, whose staffincluded\nAmerican, British, and French officers, covered a wide range of subjects to include\ntechnical matters, order of battle, collection methods, and the interrogation of prisoners.\nIn August 1918, Army military intelligence became a division of the general staff. During\nthe course of World War I, General Pershing crafted an intelligence organization that\nexhibited benefit for the American military. The organizational model was adapted from\nthe British system and included a \u201cG\u201d prefix and section numbers. Pershing\u2019s intelligence\nstructure is outlined in \nBox 12.1\n.\nIn the interwar years, intelligence efforts were divided between the Department of\nState, Department of Justice, Army, and Navy, with few resources available to conduct\noperations. It was a period referred to by Volkman and Baggett as \u201cthe time of the\namateur spy in the United States,\u201d where a high premium was placed on human\nintelligence. Many private American citizens, such as author Ernest Hemingway, aviator\nCharles Lindbergh, and professional baseball player Morris \u201cMoe\u201d Berg, were recruited\nas intelligence operatives (Volkman & Baggett, 1989; see also \nBox 4.6\n).\nBy World War II, the clear need for a large, comprehensive intelligence organization\nto assist in the war effort led to the formation of first the Coordinator of Information\n(COI), and then, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). The OSS had a mandate to collect\nand analyze strategic information. At its peak in late 1944, OSS employed almost 13,000\nmen and women. Its organizational structure is detailed in \nFigure 12.2\n. Interestingly, its\nstructure and many of its functions mirror those of modern-day agencies such as the\nCIA and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).\nThroughout the Cold War, assets of the United States military were extensively used\nto collect information that could be developed into intelligence. Human intelligence,\naerial surveillance, to include aircraftand satellites, naval assets, to include \u201cspy ships\u201d\nand specially prepared submarines, gathered source materials from which intelligence\nwas prepared. During this period, additional intelligence related agencies were created,\nand military intelligence continued to evolve. In 1958, the National Security Council\ncreated the \nUnited States Intelligence Board\n. The Board\u2019s members were the\nSecretaries of State and Defense, the Directors of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation,\nCIA, and National Security Agency (NSA), representatives of the military services, and,\nrepresentatives formerly responsible for communications intelligence (Allen & Shellum,\n2002).\n322\nBox 12.1\n \nGeneral Pershing\u2019s 1918 Intelligence Structure\nG2A (Information)\n1\n. \n\u2014Order of Battle and Strategic Intelligence\n2\n. \n\u2014Translation/Interpretation and Technical Intelligence\n3\n. \n\u2014Situation Maps and Aerial Reconnaissance\n4\n. \n\u2014Summaries and Terrain Studies\n5\n. \n\u2014Artillery Target Development\n6\n. \n\u2014Radio Intelligence and Carrier Pigeons\n7\n. \n\u2014Dissemination and G2 Journal\nG2B (Secret Service)\n1\n. \n\u2014Counterespionage Policy and Investigation of Atrocities\n2\n. \n\u2014Dissemination of Information from Secret Sources and Control of\nIntelligence Contingency Funds\n3\n. \n\u2014Index of Suspects, Control of the Civil Population, and\nCounterespionage Operations\nG2C (Topography)\n was not divided into sections but was responsible for\nthe preparation of maps and for sound and flash ranging\nG2D (Censorship)\n1\n. \n\u2014Press Relations and Press Censorship\n2\n. \n\u2014Censorship Regulations and Postal and Telegraphic Censorship\n3\n. \n\u2014Photograph and Movie Censorship and Visitors\nG2E (Intelligence Corps)\n administered the Corps of Intelligence Police\nSource:\n U.S. Army.

In 1967, while off the\ncoast of the Sinai Peninsula, the intelligence-gathering \nship \nUSS Liberty\n was attacked\nand damaged by Israeli aircraft; 34 crewmen were killed and 173 wounded. In 1968, the\nUSS Pueblo\n was captured by the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) on\nJanuary 23, 1968 while off the coast of North Korea. In 1968, the crew of the \nPueblo\n was\nreleased, but the ship remains in North Korea to this day.\nFigure 12.2\n The organizational structure of the OSS, the predecessor to the CIA. (Source: CIA)\n324\nCurrent State of Military Intelligence\nBy 2017, military intelligence was just one part of the intelligence community (IC). It\nremains essential for command and control and is virtually inseparable from operations.\nAccurate, timely, and relevant intelligence is critical to the planning and conduct of\nsuccessful operations. Effective intelligence uncovers enemy weaknesses, which can be\nexploited to provide a decisive advantage. Shortfalls in intelligence can lead to confusion,\nindecision, unnecessary loss of life, mission failure, or even defeat. The evolution of the\npreviously described joint intelligence, as carried out by \nNational Intelligence Support\nTeams\n, \nJoint Analysis Centers\n, and the \nDefense Collection Coordination Center\n(DCCC)\n, further points to the interest of the military in developing better \u201chorizontal\u201d\nand synergistic management and operations of national collection assets.\n325\nIntelligence Role of the Commander\nAs the official tasked with ultimate responsibility for all facets of his or her assigned\nmissions, commanders drive the intelligence effort. To the commander, intelligence must\nbe more than a function that delivers maps, gives the weather, and disseminates a daily\nintelligence summary\u2014it must be a function that serves as the basis of all decision-\nmaking.\nThe military commander, on every level, has a responsibility to establish intelligence\npriorities identifying those pieces of information that are the most critical to the\ndecision-making process. The commander is also responsible for the development and\noperations of their staff, which includes the intelligence assets.\n326\nRole of the Military Intelligence Officer\nThe primary function of \nMilitary Intelligence Officers (IOs)\n is the collection, analysis,\nproduction, and dissemination of intelligence at the tactical operational, and strategic\nlevels. This is accomplished through the deployment of intelligence collection assets, the\ncombination and preparation of all-source intelligence estimates, preparation of\nintelligence plans in support of combat operations, and the coordination of aerial and\nground surveillance. Information collected about the enemy or potential enemy is passed\non to a decision-maker.\nIn all, the IO supports the commander; identifies, defines, and nominates objectives;\nplans and executes operations in support of the commander\u2019s goals and objectives; assists\nsecurity operations in an attempt to avoid deception and surprise; assists security of\noperations through military deception; and assists in evaluating operations.\n327\nThe \u201c2 Section\u201d\nThe various staffs in the United States military are organized numerically. The \u201c2\u201d is the\nintelligence section. The commander should require, and the J-2 should ensure, that all\nintelligence activities, assets, and disciplines are applied in time, space, and purpose to\nprovide optimal support to the commander\u2019s operational plan. Personnel in the \n2 Section\nparticipate in the decision and planning process from the initial point when operations\nare contemplated or directed. Effective intelligence support requires a two-way flow of\nessential information. The 2 Section and intelligence staff must also develop and\ncontinuously refine their abilities to think like the adversary.\n328\nMilitary Intelligence Assets\nMilitary intelligence relies on a wide range of assets from which information is collected\nand processed into intelligence. Assets range from human assets, such as \u201cmilitary boots\non the ground,\u201d to a wide assortment of high-technology ships, aircraft, and satellites.\nTechnological advancements over the past 200 years have been substantial. For\nexample, the Civil War witnessed the use of balloons to monitor troop movements from\nthe air. During the Mexican Border Expedition, World War I, and the \u201cSmall Wars\u201d of\nthe 1920s and 1930s, aircraftwere used with various levels of success in the intelligence\nfield. However, during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and throughout\nthe Cold War, aerial advancement rose to unprecedented levels. The U-2 and SR-71 spy\nplanes provided reconnaissance information that included flyovers of hostile territory,\nsuch as Cuba and the Soviet Union. Currently, battlefield information is obtained from\nunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have proven their value in Afghanistan and\nIraq.\n329\nIntelligence Preparation of the Operational Environment\nand Today\u2019s Threat Structure\nGood intelligence begins with commanders clearly identifying their intelligence\nconcerns and needs. Designed to support staff estimates and military decision-making,\nIntelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB)\n is a systematic process of analyzing\nthe threat and environment in a specific geographic area. The IPB process helps the\ncommander selectively apply and maximize combat power at critical points in time and\nspace on the battlefield by determining the threat\u2019s likely course of action and military\ncapabilities.\nThreats pose significant challenges to national security policy-makers. According to\nLieutenant General Patrick M. Hughes, former Director of the DIA:\nThreat \u2026 is no longer a self-evident term. The defense intelligence community has traditionally focused on a\nprimary element of the threat, enemy forces and weapons systems; clearly that aspect remains. But as military\nactivity extends to missions involving the use of military forces in non-traditional roles, we must adapt our\nintelligence focus to meet new requirements. (Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House of\nRepresentatives, 1996)\n330\nMilitary Intelligence Within the National Defense\nStructure\nThe United States military is constantly evolving. World events drive staffing levels,\ntraining, equipment, and, of course, intelligence needs. In \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d),\nwe discussed the civilian agencies under the control of the military, including the NSA,\nDIA, National Reconnaissance Office (NRO), and National Geospatial-Intelligence\nAgency (NGA). In this chapter, we focus on the intelligence capabilities of the individual\nservices.\nOne of the earliest vestiges of formal military intelligence cooperation was the \nJoint\nIntelligence Committee (JIC)\n created in 1941 as a coordinating mechanism for the\nfledgling Joint Chiefs of Staff organization (although it can be argued that the \nJoint\nArmy\u2013Navy Board\n established in 1905 sought interservice cooperation in intelligence\nmatters as U.S. involvement in World War I became imminent). The Committee\nconsisted of the directors and representatives of the intelligence organs of the Army, the\nNavy, the State Department, the Board of Economic Warfare, and the COI (Allen &\nShellum, 2002).\nToday, the \nSecretary of Defense\n oversees all military intelligence organizations. The\nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and\nIntelligence\n provides the principal staff support to the Secretary for executing his\nfunctions with regard to intelligence (e.g., developing and monitoring compliance with\npolicy and allocating resources).\nThe \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\n, the senior military officer\nresponsible for each of the services, provides direction to the Joint Staff Director for\nIntelligence, J-2, to ensure that adequate, timely, and reliable intelligence, and CI\nsupport, is available to the JCS and the combatant commands.\nWithin each command, \nJoint Intelligence Centers (JICs)\n serve as focal points for\ntasking national and tactical intelligence collectors. The establishment of JICs addressed\nthe realization that the operational commander did not understand, nor had the time to\ndeal with tasking national collectors. The JICs also provide analysis tailored to the needs\nof the President, his staff, and subordinate commanders (Marchio, 2007).\n331\nUnited States Army\nThe Army did not acquire a permanent peacetime intelligence organization until 1885,\nwhen the Division of Military Information was established. Although intelligence has\nalways been an important component of military \noperations, it played a relatively minor\nrole in the structure of that service until World War II, when the first military\nintelligence units were formed. As well, the Army did not formally recognize\nintelligence as a distinct professional discipline until 1962. The \nArmy Intelligence and\nSecurity Branch\n, the predecessor of today\u2019s \nMilitary Intelligence Branch\n, was\nestablished in July 1962. On July 1, 1967, this branch was re-designated as \nMilitary\nIntelligence\n. The \nMilitary Intelligence Corps\n, which incorporated all military\nintelligence personnel and units into a single large regiment, came into existence in 1987\n(Finnegan & Danysh, 1998).\n332\nUnited States Navy\nThe \nOffice of Naval Intelligence (ONI)\n was established in the United States Navy in\n1882. In 1945, the ONI began hiring civilian experts in a wide range of fields to diversify\nits technical expertise. The development of the \nSound Surveillance System\n and the\nestablishment of a dedicated acoustic intelligence facility during the Cold War allowed\nthe Navy to track Soviet submarines remotely. The \nNavy Scientific and Technical\nIntelligence Center\n was established in 1968 and merged with the \nNavy\nReconnaissance and Technical Support Center\n in 1972.\n333\nUnited States Marine Corps\nAlthough technically reporting to the Secretary of the Navy, the Marine Corps possesses\nits own intelligence capability. Many of the activities of the Marine Corps involve CI\nfunctions. During the 1930s, before the United States entered into World War II, Marine\nand Navy CI activities included the monitoring of \u201cpatriotic societies,\u201d who were\nbelieved to be carrying out \u201csubversive, pacifistic, and defeatist activities against the\nUnited States\u201d (Marine Corps Counterintelligence Association, n.d.). It was not until\n1948, however, that Marines received their first formal CI training. Because they were\nthe first group of Marines to receive formal training in CI, they represented a \u201cnucleus\u201d\nmeant to facilitate the training of others during future periods (Marine Corps\nCounterintelligence Association, n.d.). Like the other operational components, Marine\nintelligence has been utilized in all major and minor combat operations since the 1950s.\n334\nUnited States Air Force\nThroughout its history, the Air Force has been heavily involved in producing aerial\nintelligence. At the end of World War II, the United States began \na strong push to\nintegrate cutting edge technologies, such as surveillance satellites and high-flying spy\nplanes, into its inventory. These elements were especially efficacious for spotting troops,\nships, missile bases, and other military facilities from the air. Additionally, satellites also\nengaged in signals intelligence (SIGINT) activities. Given the nature of the threat,\ngeospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and SIGINT were especially good collection platforms\nduring the Cold War.\nIn the 1950s, President Eisenhower authorized an intelligence mission, \nProject Home\nRun\n, to use American bombers, with electronic collection gear to penetrate Soviet\nairspace to gather various types of intelligence. Approximately 50 of the converted\nbombers were tasked for the missions, many flying deep into Soviet territory. Project\nHome Run and the other attempts to use aircraftto penetrate Soviet airspace resulted in\nthe loss of more than 40 United States aircraftand the death of about 200 servicemen. To\nmaintain the secrecy of the missions, the families were given misinformation by the U.S.\nmilitary about how they died, many only learning decades later the truth of the deaths of\ntheir service members (Bamford, 2002).\nBy the time President Eisenhower had approved the building of the U-2 spy plane in\nlate 1954, peacetime strategic overflight reconnaissance had become a firm U.S. policy.\nThe platforms from which to conduct it, meanwhile, moved to ever-higher altitudes:\nfrom military aircraftto high-altitude balloons, from the U-2 to the SR-71, a supersonic\naircraftthat could fly at altitudes above 80,000 ft\u2014and, ultimately, from airspace into\nouter space with reconnaissance satellites.\nToday, the Air Force still maintains the capability for conducting surveil-lance of large\nmilitary targets. To meet the threat of asymmetrical and terrorist groups, it has also\ndeveloped a robust UAV capability, which is used daily in war zones and areas where\nterrorists are thought to reside.\n335\nConclusion\nAccurate and timely intelligence, used judiciously by a commander, can make the\ndifference between battlefield success and failure. In many instances, intelligence has\nshortened wars and saved lives. Having knowledge of one\u2019s enemy, as well as one\u2019s self,\nare both crucial to leveraging information activities and the overall intelligence function.\nThrough such knowledge, one may potentially identify strengths, weaknesses,\nopportunities, and threats that influence the rendering of human decisions, thereby\npotentially generating successful outcomes during conflicts.\nMilitary intelligence has been a staple of war since the American Revolution. It was\nduring this conflict that General George Washington mandated the first American\nmilitary use of an intelligence function. Throughout the remainder of the wars involving\nthe United States, the use of intelligence has influenced the decisions of presidential and\nmilitary leaderships.\nThe use of intelligence provides significant benefits when it yields the influencing of\nhuman decisions that generate successful outcomes. However, leveraging intelligence\ninvolves risk when contemplating a potential course of action. Human imperfections\nmay be interjected within the intelligence cycle, thereby impeding the efficiency and\neffectiveness of intelligence activities.\nThe use of an intelligence function involves risk, which may lead to failure. Within\nthe context of American history, the failure to interpret intelligence before the Japanese\nattack on Pearl Harbor yielded a devastating outcome for American forces in the Pacific.\nIt also heralded the entrance of the United States into World War II. Although the\nattacks against the World Trade Center (1993 and 2001) did not involve the military, they\nare relevant examples of intelligence failures that had catastrophic consequences.\nEach of the American armed forces has some form of intelligence function. The\norigins of these units vary with respect to the mission and function of the parent\norganization. Regardless of such differences, all U.S. military forces leverage intelligence\nproducts to facilitate decision-making. It is with the compilation and culmination of\nrendering of such decisions that the American military pursues the goal of generating\noutcomes that are advantageous to the United States during periods of conflict.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nIn the United States, military intelligence agencies came into existence before\ncivilian ones (e.g., the CIA). Given the history of America, why do you think\nthis was the case?\n2\n. \nHow is military intelligence the same as other types of intelligence you have\n336\nstudied so far? How is it different?\n3\n. \nImagine you are a military commander. Your troops have captured a foreign\nenemy combatant on the battlefield. Would you consider using \u201cenhanced\ninterrogation techniques,\u201d such as waterboarding, to extract information? Why\nor why not?\n4\n. \nCurrent law prohibits the military from conducting law enforcement and\nintelligence activities on American soil. Is this a good idea? Why or why not?\n337\nKey Terms\n2 Section\nArmy Intelligence and Security Branch\nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and\nIntelligence\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS)\nCollection, Processing, and Analysis (military)\nCommand and control\nDefense Collection Coordination Center\nDirection and Prioritisation (military)\nDissemination (military)\nIntelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB)\nJoint Analysis Centers\nJoint Intelligence Centers (JICs)\nJoint Intelligence Committee\nJoint Intelligence/Joint Publication 2\u20130\nMilitary Intelligence (Army)\nMilitary Intelligence Branch\nMilitary Intelligence Corps\nMilitary intelligence cycle\nMilitary intelligence officers (IOs)\nNational Intelligence Support Teams\nNavy Reconnaissance and Technical Support Center\nNavy Scientific and Technical Intelligence Center\nOffice of Naval Intelligence (ONI)\nOperation Fortitude\nPlanning (military)\nProduction (military)\nProject Home Run\nReview (military)\nSecretary of Defense\nSound Surveillance System\nUnited States Intelligence Board\nUSS Liberty\n338\nNote\n1\n The authors thank Citadel Fellow of Intelligence Michael Brady (United States Army, retired) for the valuable\nguidance he provided during the writing of the present chapter.\n339\nReferences\nAllen, D.

Over the years, each has been shown\nto have a significant effect on crime reduction. Although crime analysis has been a staple\nof criminal investigations for several years, until the attacks of 9/11 criminal intelligence\nactivities were primarily limited to federal, state, and large local agencies. Today,\nhowever, with the introduction of the Intelligence-Led and Preventative Policing models,\nmany departments gather and use intelligence routinely. Some, such as the New York\nand Los Angeles Police Departments, even assign detectives overseas to conduct liaisons\nwith foreign law enforcement and intelligence organizations.\n342\nHistory of Intelligence in Law Enforcement\nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d) describes the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation\u2019s (FBI) history of intelligence operations. Indeed, most federal law\nenforcement agencies have historically fielded intelligence units to assist with complex\ncriminal cases and to help understand large, multitiered organizations such as La Cosa\nNostra. However, until recently, it was unusual for most local law enforcement agencies\nto employ intelligence units to assist in national security matters (e.g., those involving\nterrorists or spies). This was not always the case. In the 1920s, many large local agencies\nhad what were termed \nRed Squads\n to keep an eye on Communists, anarchists, and\npolitical dissidents. Very often, these squads were run with little oversight and few rules.\nBy the 1970s, however, when such operations as the FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO\n(Counterintelligence Program) and the Central Intelligence Agency\u2019s (CIA) Operation\nCHAOS were exposed, local police departments came under scrutiny as well. Many\nagencies were sued by political activists who believed that the police had no business\n\u201cspying\u201d on them. The police lost many of these cases; plaintiffs who claimed that their\ncivil rights had been violated were paid many thousands of dollars. As a result, law\nenforcement intelligence activities were sharply curtailed or completely done away with\nin many departments. A host of agencies got out of the \u201cintelligence business\u201d for many\nyears. Even the word \u201cintelligence\u201d took on a negative connotation at the local level.\nThis all changed after the attacks of 9/11. Police and sheriff\u2019s departments realized that\nthey had a significant role to play in maintaining national security\u2014the approximately\n700,000 local law enforcement officers employed in the United States far exceed the\nnumber of FBI agents (approximately 13,000). As a result, they are the real \u201ceyes and\nears\u201d of intelligence collection. Correspondingly, local police agencies have begun\nproducing and consuming intelligence after a lapse of many years. In America, which\nhas more than 18,000 different law enforcement organizations, the real challenge is\nsharing intelligence in an efficient, legal manner. In the past few years, initiatives such\nas the FBI\u2019s Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs), described in \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC\nToday\u201d), and the intelligence-led policing movement described below, have helped\nstandardize and unify law enforcement intelligence efforts. However, meaningful\nsharing between agencies will likely continue to be a challenge for years to come.\nOn the other hand, many law enforcement agencies have been engaged in crime\nanalysis for most of their existence. For a long time, this meant sticking pins in large\nmaps to track crime patterns and trends. Recently, the advent and increasing\nfunctionality of computers have revolutionized the analytical function. As well, criminal\njustice research has confirmed that most crimes occur in only a few areas and take place\nwith some degree of predictability. As a result, the police can now track crime trends,\nhelping to catch serial offenders, and even anticipating where future crimes may occur.\n343\nAlthough not quite as adept as the \u201cPre-Crime Unit\u201d featured in the movie \nMinority\nReport\n, Predictive Policing (preventing crimes before they occur) may be the wave of the\nfuture.\n344\nLaw Enforcement and Intelligence\nBecause of prior abuses and the Constitutional protections afforded American citizens,\nthere are many rules that govern how information can be gathered and intelligence used\nby law enforcement agencies. Primarily, this concerns the collection function\u2014under\nwhat circumstances and in what manner can the police collect information about U.S.\ncitizens or those living in the United States? \nChapter 10\n (\u201cConstitutional Mandates\u2014\nOverview of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial Roles\u201d) discusses the rules that pertain\nto information collection by law enforcement. Generally, the police need to have a\nreason beyond a \u201cgut feeling\u201d to believe that someone has committed, or is going to\ncommit, a criminal act. In addition, engaging in activities protected by the Constitution\u2014\npolitical speech, peaceful assembly, exercise of religion\u2014is not, in and of itself, enough\njustification for the police to gather information.\nTable 13.1\n \nTreverton\u2019s Differences between Law Enforcement and Intelligence\nLaw Enforcement Functions\nIntelligence Functions\nMake the Case:\n Gather sufficient evidence to\nprove guilt in a court of law\nPolicy:\n Provide policymakers with\ninformation to help them reduce\nuncertainty and make better decisions\nReactive:\n Collect information after a crime has\nbeen committed\nProactive:\n Collect information before the\nfact to help form policy, devise strategy\nand/or prevent undesirable consequences\n(e.g., terrorist attack)\nCollection Standard: Rules of Evidence:\n Gather\ninformation and evidence in strict accordance\nwith the Constitution and all applicable rules\nof evidence.\nStandard: Good Enough:\n Gather and use\nany and all information as long as its\ncredibility is sufficient\nGoal: Introduce Evidence in Court:\n Introduce\nevidence in court that will establish a\ndefendant\u2019s guilt. As such, both the source of\nevidence and the method by which it was\nobtained must, by law, be revealed.\nGoal: Protect Sources:\n Protect \u201csources\nand methods\u201d at all costs. The goal is to\nensure that they remain unknown and\nable to produce useful, credible\ninformation for as long as possible.\nSource:\n Treverton, G., personal communication with the author, 2007.\nSome experts have noted that law enforcement and intelligence functions are vastly\ndifferent. For example, RAND Corporation scholar and former IC analyst Greg\nTreverton has compiled a list of differences between intelligence and law enforcement\n(\nTable 13.1\n). Some believe that the differences are so great that law enforcement agencies\nshould not try to engage in national security issues; these individuals claim, for example,\nthat the FBI should remain strictly a law enforcement agency and that a new domestic\n345\nintelligence organization should be created to deal with terrorism and\ncounterintelligence matters. This is the way Britain operates. Although the UK has a host\nof police agencies, including the famous London Metropolitan Police, it also has a\ndomestic intelligence organization\u2014Military Intelligence 5 (\nMI-5\n). Functioning like a\ndomestic CIA, MI-5 personnel do not have law enforcement or arrest powers. In 2006,\nthe organization foiled a plot by al Qa\u2019ida operatives to attack London\u2019s Heathrow\nAirport. This success prompted U.S. Appeals Court Judge and terrorism expert Richard\nPosner to conclude that the United \nStates needs its own MI-5. In an editorial that\nappeared in \nThe Washington Post\n, Posner wrote:\nThe Bureau [FBI] is a criminal investigation agency. Its orientation is toward arrest and prosecution \u2026. [t]he\nBritish tend to wait and watch longer so that they can learn more before moving against plotters. (Posner, 2006)\nOthers have argued that creating a domestic intelligence agency would seriously\nundermine civil liberties. Given its long experience with enforcing the laws of the land\nwhile adhering to Constitutional rules and procedures, some critics of the MI-5 model\ncontend that the FBI should retain its status as the primary domestic\ncounterterrorism/counterintelligence organization in the United States. One very\ninfluential body that concluded that an MI-5 was unnecessary for the United States was\nthe 9/11 Commission. Their reasoning appears in \nBox 13.1\n.\nBox 13.1\n \n9/11 Commission Analysis of Whether the\nUnited States needs its Own MI-5\nWe have considered proposals for a new agency dedicated to intelligence collection\nin the United States. Some call this a proposal for an \u201cAmerican MI-5,\u201d although the\nanalogy is weak\u2014the actual British Security Service is a relatively small worldwide\nagency that combines duties assigned in the U.S. government to the Terrorist Threat\nIntegration Center, the CIA, the FBI, and the Department of Homeland Security.\nWe do not recommend the creation of a new domestic intelligence agency. It is\nnot needed if our other recommendations are adopted\u2014to establish a strong\nnational intelligence center, part of the NCTC, that will oversee counterterrorism\nintelligence work, foreign and domestic, and to create a National Intelligence\nDirector, who can set and enforce standards for the collection, processing, and\nreporting of information.\nUnder the structures we recommend, the FBI\u2019s role is focused, but still vital. The\nFBI does need to be able to direct its thousands of agents and other employees to\ncollect intelligence in America\u2019s cities and towns\u2014 interviewing informants,\nconducting surveillance and searches, tracking individuals, working collaboratively\nwith local authorities, and doing so with meticulous attention to detail and\ncompliance with the law. The FBI\u2019s job in the streets of the United States would\nthus be a domestic equivalent, operating under the U.S. Constitution and different\n346\nlaws and rules, to the job of the CIA\u2019s operations officers abroad.\nCreating a new domestic intelligence agency has other drawbacks.\nThe FBI is accustomed to carrying out sensitive intelligence collection\noperations in compliance with the law. If a new domestic intelligence\nagency were outside of the Department of Justice, the process of legal\noversight\u2014never easy\u2014could become even more \ndifficult. Abuses of civil\nliberties could create a backlash that would impair the collection of needed\nintelligence.\nCreating a new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention of the\nofficials most responsible for current counterterrorism efforts while the\nthreat remains high. Putting a new player into the mix of federal agencies\nwith counterterrorism responsibilities would exacerbate existing\ninformation-sharing problems.\nA new domestic intelligence agency would need to acquire assets and\npersonnel. The FBI already has 28,000 employees; 56 field offices, 400\nsatellite offices, and 47 legal attach\u00e9 offices; a laboratory, operations center,\nand training facility; an existing network of informants, cooperating\ndefendants, and other sources; and relationships with state and local law\nenforcement, the CIA, and foreign intelligence and law enforcement\nagencies.\nCounterterrorism investigations in the United States very quickly become\nmatters that involve violations of criminal law and possible law\nenforcement action. Because the FBI can have agents working criminal\nmatters and agents working intelligence investigations concerning the\nsame international terrorism target, the full range of investigative tools\nagainst a suspected terrorist can be considered within one agency. The\nremoval of \u201cthe wall\u201d that existed before 9/11 between intelligence and law\nenforcement has opened new opportunities for cooperative action within\nthe FBI.\nCounterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other criminal\ninvestigations, such as money laundering or the smuggling of contraband.\nIn the field, the close connection to criminal work has many benefits.\nSource:\n 9/11 Commission. (2004). How to do it? A different way of organizing the\ngovernment. Final report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon\nthe United States.\n347\nCriminal Intelligence Before the 9/11 Attacks\nIt would be incorrect to assume that criminal intelligence began after the 9/11 attacks.\nLaw enforcement personnel who investigate large organized crime and drug\norganizations have used intelligence methods such as those used by the CIA for years.\nTo understand the organization and structure of large criminal organizations, law\nenforcement agencies compiled large dossiers of individuals and groups, utilizing\ntradecraftsuch as long-term informants and wiretaps to collect information. Ultimately,\nthe intelligence gathered helped guide investigations.\nIn the early 1990s, the police in America were looking for better ways to carry out\ntheir duties. A series of studies dating from the 1970s had cast doubt on many of the\nprocedures that were believed to be effective: measures \nsuch as random patrol, strict\nenforcement of laws with limited discretion, and rapid response to 9\u20131\u20131 calls were\nshown not to reduce crime. In addition, the police were often very unpopular in the\ncommunities that needed them most: they were seen as \u201coccupying forces,\u201d not unlike an\ninvading army. As a result, a variety of new policing models were attempted. One,\ndubbed \nCommunity Oriented Policing\n, sought to integrate the police into communities\nas a positive force. The thought was that, if citizens trusted the police, they would be\nmore willing to cooperate with them and provide information that would lead to\nreductions in crime. A second approach, termed \nProblem Oriented Policing (POP)\n, saw\ncrime as a symptom of larger social problems; if problems could be identified and\ncorrected, crime would go down. Both approaches relied on intelligence. As a result, by\nthe early 1990s, many U.S. police departments were seeking ways to reintegrate\nintelligence into their operations while still retaining the trust of their citizens and\nensuring that they adhered to all laws and guidelines.\nThe model that ultimately proved successful came not from the United States, but\ninstead from the United Kingdom. In the early 1990s, the police in the Kent and\nNorthumbria Constabularies noted a series of car thefts. Rudimentary investigation\nrevealed that an organized band of criminals was likely behind the thefts. Instead of\nmerely reacting to the crimes, the police engaged in a systematic analysis of what was\nhappening. Ultimately, they arrested the thieves, and the crimes stopped. This convinced\nthe police that intelligence measures could prove both effective and efficient in the\nprevention of crime. As a direct result of these efforts, the UK authorities discovered a\n\u201cbetter\u201d way of policing\u2014one that involved intelligence and analysis.\nThis realization led to the creation of the UK\u2019s \nNational Intelligence Model\n, a\nproactive, nationwide initiative to reduce crime through the use of intelligence. The birth\nof this concept led to a completely new paradigm, which became known as \nIntelligence-\nLed Policing\n.\n348\nIntelligence-Led Policing in the United States and the\nNational Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan\nForward thinking law enforcement executives in the United States recognized the\nefficacy and utility of Britain\u2019s National Intelligence Model and sought to integrate it\ninto American policing. However, given the negative connotation intelligence had in\nmost agencies in the 1990s, the concept did not take off. It took the 9/11 attacks to\nconvince many in law enforcement that their goal should be to prevent crime rather\nthan reacting to it once it occurred. Overnight, the concept of Intelligence-Led Policing\nhad great resonance for both law enforcement officials and the citizens they served.\nFortunately, the United States was not completely unprepared. A series of intelligence\ninitiatives was already in place. These included:\nThe Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program:\n A nationwide\nprogram sponsored by the Justice Department where federal, state, and local law\nenforcement agencies share intelligence over a secure intranet connection.\nStarted in 1973, RISS was formed to disseminate and share organized crime and\ngang intelligence (\nFigure 13.1\n). It operates a secure intranet, known as\nRISSNET\u2122 to facilitate nationwide law enforcement communications and\ninformation sharing.\nJoint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs)\n: By the late 1970s, it was clear that\nterrorism was a threat to the United States. Because most international terrorism\ninvestigations were classified, the FBI was unable to share intelligence with state\nand local agencies. As a result, in 1980, the FBI established the first JTTF in New\nYork City. In a JTTF, detectives from local agencies obtain security clearances\nand work cases alongside FBI and other federal personnel. There are more than\n100 JTTFs in existence today throughout the United States.\nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program\n: A counternarcotics\nenforcement program that coordinates activities between federal, state, and local\nagencies. Established in 1990, HIDTA is the latest in a series of federal initiatives\naimed at dealing with the problem of illicit drugs.\nIn addition, most state and large local police departments had intelligence units. Despite\nall of these initiatives, however, intelligence was still not a priority in law enforcement\nuntil the attacks of 9/11.\n349\nFigure 13.1\n \nIncreasingly, law enforcement agencies are turning to systems like RISSNET\u2122 to facilitate\nnationwide law enforcement communications and information sharing. (Source: FBI)\nThroughout the late 1990s, a group of state and local officials who worked with the\nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) tried to adapt \nthe UK\u2019s National\nIntelligence Model for use in the United States. They worked with professional agencies\nsuch as the \nInternational Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts\n and\nthe \nWestern States Information Network\n to develop an American version of\nIntelligence-Led Policing. This came at the same time that many agencies had begun to\nshiftresources to crime prevention rather than only dealing with crime after it had\noccurred. Prevention requires the ability to look ahead and forecast; as a result,\nintelligence is critical to the prevention process.\nDespite this realization, it took the 9/11 attacks to force serious change. In early 2002,\nthe IACP convened a Criminal Intelligence Sharing Summit that was attended by many\nprominent law enforcement personnel. From this summit, a document titled the\nNational Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP)\n was developed. The NCISP\ncontained recommendations for implementing Intelligence-Led Policing in any agency,\nregardless of its size or jurisdiction. The plan discussed how information could be legally\ncollected and maintained, the training that analytical personnel should receive, how\nintelligence could be effectively and efficiently shared, and other critical subjects. In\ntheory, a law enforcement agency could use the NCISP to develop, fund, and maintain\nan intelligence capability that would prove effective and could pass legal muster.

Executive summary: National Criminal\nIntelligence Sharing Plan.\nhttp://it.ojp.gov/documents/NCISP_executive_summary.pdf\n.\nOf course, different agencies have integrated intelligence into their operations at\nvarying levels. The FBI, which now describes itself as an \u201cintelligence-led agency,\u201d\ncreated an entire organization within the Bureau, the Directorate of Intelligence, to\noversee investigations in this area. As well, it has reorganized both headquarters and\nfield divisions to enhance intelligence functions, establishing Field Intelligence Groups in\nevery office. In addition, the FBI has hired scores of intelligence analysts and established\nnew positions, such as Senior Intelligence Officer.\nIn terms of local agencies, perhaps no organization has embraced intelligence more\nthan the New York City Police Department (NYPD). Under the guidance of\nCommissioner Ray Kelly, the NYPD established the Intelligence Division & Counter-\nTerrorism Bureau (ID/CTB), which was first rum run by former CIA official David\nCohen. The IT/CTB, which functions in some ways like a mini-CIA, employs more than\n500 individuals, many of whom speak languages that include Arabic, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto,\nGerman, Hebrew, Italian, Russian, and Chinese (New York City Police Department, n.d.).\nThe missions of the FBI\u2019s New York JTTF, on which NYPD detectives serve, and the\nID/CTB are closely related. In some instances, this has led to friction and competition.\nFor example, in 2009, the IT/CTB allegedly inadvertently jeopardized a case being\nworked by the JTTF concerning a suspected al Qa\u2019ida sympathizer who intended to plant\nbombs in New York City. NYPD detectives interviewed an Imam who informed the\nsuspect that the police were \u201con to him,\u201d thus prompting the Bureau to make arrests\nearlier than it had wished.\nDespite occasional mishaps such as those cited above, is there evidence that\nIntelligence-Led Policing is having a positive effect on reducing crime and preventing\nterrorism? There have been no major terrorist acts in the United States since 9/11, which\nis a positive sign. As well, one group of scholars has calculated that 28 terrorist events\nhave been foiled by law enforcement between the 9/11 attacks and the year 2010\n(McNeill, Carafano, & Zuckerman, 2010). Although this evidence is not conclusive, it\nseems to indicate that integrating intelligence into law enforcement leads to \u201csmarter\u201d\n351\npolicing.\nFusion Centers\nMost police departments lack the resources to engage in sophisticated intelligence\noperations like the NYPD. Nevertheless, frontline officers from every agency should be\nthe \u201ceyes and ears\u201d of all domestic intelligence efforts. To make this happen, the\nDepartments of Homeland Security and Justice began funding the creation of fusion\ncenters beginning in 2003. As described in \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC Today\u201d), a fusion center is\na state-run entity that collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence to law\nenforcement agencies within the state. Not limited only to state and local personnel, it is\ncommon for FBI, CIA, military, and private sector personnel to participate in fusion\ncenters as permitted by law. Currently, every state has at least one center. In addition to\nassisting law enforcement, fusion centers provide services to public safety, fire service,\nemergency response, and public health agencies. For a discussion of the legal\nimplications of fusion centers, see \nChapter 10\n (\u201cConstitutional Mandates-Overview of\nExecutive, Legislative, and Judicial Roles\u201d).\n352\nCrime Analysis\nThough Intelligence-Led Policing is a relatively new concept for the United States, \ncrime\nanalysis\n, at least in its rudimentary form, is not. Seasoned police officers know that\ncrime is not equally distributed\u2014a small percentage of the population commits most of\nthe serious crime, and most criminal acts occur in relatively few geographic locations. To\nthat end, if the police can determine who is likely to commit a crime and when and\nwhere it will occur, they can take steps to arrest the perpetrator in the act or prevent it\nfrom happening at all. This is the general premise of crime analysis; Boba (2001) formally\nidentifies four functions:\nApprehend criminals\nPrevent crime\nReduce disorder\nEvaluate organizational procedures\nResearch Behind Crime Analysis\nCriminologists have been able to confirm what the police have known for years: crime\ntends to center around hot spots\u2014areas that have a disproportionate amount of criminal\nactivity. For example, one famous study found that 3% of the addresses in a large\nAmerican city were the subject of 50% of the calls for service for the police (Sherman,\nGartin, & Buerger, 1989). Sometimes these hot spots are permanent, as in bars that\nregularly generate a large number of fights. Occasionally, they are transitory, like the\nopen-air drug market that \u201cfloats\u201d from place to place, depending on police presence.\nAt any rate, if the police can identify where a hot spot will occur, they can take steps\nto arrest offenders or, by their mere presence, prevent the crime from occurring in the\nfirst place. Although this may seem self-evident, before the 1990s, there were a number\nof criminologists who believed that the police could do little to prevent crime. As a\nresult, they suggested that the best law enforcement could do was to react to crime once\nit occurred, arresting perpetrators to preserve a sense of community \u201cjustice.\u201d\nTwo relatively simultaneous developments\u2014research that confirmed the police could\nprevent crime if they had sufficient knowledge and the rapid improvement of computers\n\u2014suggested that law enforcement could have an effect on crime. It also told the police\nthey could move from the \u201cpin-in-map\u201d era to one in which digitized information and\nanalysis revolutionized the way they did business.\nAll of this culminated in a model termed Problem Oriented Policing (POP), which saw\ncrime as a symptom of some deeper problem; by using analysis, one could determine the\nroot cause of a particular problem and ultimately prevent it from occurring in the first\n353\nplace. The POP model consists of the following four steps, known collectively as \nSARA\n:\nScanning\n: Defining the problem and collecting information\nAnalysis\n: Applying concepts of critical thinking to assess the information\ncollected and determine the root cause of crime\nResponse\n: Formulating a strategy to reduce, mitigate, or eliminate the\nconditions that produce crime\nAssessment\n: Using reliable and valid measures to determine if the response was\nsuccessful\nThe essential step in SARA is analysis\u2014often, the causes and solutions to crime may be\nrelatively easy to fix but non-obvious. For example, if an outdoor location produces a\nsignificant number of assaults in the evening hours, the simplest and most efficacious\nsolution may be to install better lighting. Realizations such as this have led to various\nbreakthroughs in crime prevention. In the case of this example, a concept known as\nCrime Prevention through Environmental Design\n has become an integral part of\ncrime analysis and POP.\nTypes of Crime Analysis\nCrime Mapping\nCrime mapping\n traces its history as far back as the 1800s when social scientists tried to\nexamine crime trends in relation to demographics and economic distribution. Large\nagencies, such as Chicago and New York Police Departments, paved the way by placing\n\u201cpins-in-maps\u201d to trace the history of criminogenic events in the hope of preventing\nfuture crimes or apprehending serial offenders.\nBy the 1990s, desktop computers had become powerful enough to replace wall maps;\nby the late 1990s, geographic information systems (GIS) became widely available and\nstarted to be used regularly in policing. One great advantage of using computers is that\ndata can be manipulated and easily visualized. \nFigure 13.2\n shows a series of burglaries\nthat can be analyzed using crime mapping techniques.\nWith the advent of crime mapping, the role of analysts became increasingly important\nin policing. Today, they work side by side with sworn officers, providing them with\nleads and paths to more efficient investigation. The ability to better understand and\nvisualize data has allowed the police to modify their organizational and command\nphilosophies. In 1994, the NYPD started its \nCOMPSTAT\n (short for \u201ccomputerized\nstatistics\u201d) program. COMPSTAT combines GIS maps and other analytical programs\nwith law enforcement managers being held strictly accountable for all crime in their\ndistrict. If crime goes up, precinct commanders are likely to lose their commands. The\ncrux of COMPSAT is a monthly meeting in which commanders, armed with crime maps\n354\nand other analytical products, face the senior leadership of the NYPD. They are then\nasked a series of questions regarding crime trends, up to and including what they are\ndoing in individual cases. These meetings can be highly acrimonious; many former\nprecinct commanders voluntarily lefttheir jobs to avoid the extreme pressure that was\nbeing placed on them.\nFigure 13.2\n \nA map showing various reported crimes within a certain period. Analysts use crime maps to\ndetermine \u201chots spots,\u201d or areas of high crime. Police leaders use intelligence of this type to determine the\nmost efficient way to deploy their often scarce resources\nCOMPSTAT has both critics and proponents. One thing cannot be argued, however\u2014\nthe rate of crime in New York City has dramatically decreased \nsince it was unveiled; by\n2010, it had fallen an astounding 77% from highs in the 1980s (MacDonald, 2010).\nGIS has played a crucial role in COMPSTAT; it allows the police to identify hot spots\nand direct more resources to affected areas, often preventing crime before it occurs. In\ngeneral, both property and violent crimes have decreased throughout the United States\nover the past several years; many credit crime analysis and COMSTAT with helping lead\nto this decrease.\nThe success of GIS and other systems has led to the development of \nPredictive\nPolicing\n, a new model that is geared toward preventing crime rather than solving it\nonce it has occurred. If successful, Predictive Policing could provide multiple benefits.\nNot only would fewer people be victimized, but America\u2019s jail and prison populations\ncould be reduced.\nIn 2010, researchers first proposed a rudimentary predictive policing model. The actual\nsystem borrowed from both criminology and seismology (the study of earthquakes). First\n355\ntested in Los Angeles, predictive policing is now in use in many states, to include\nCalifornia, Washington, South Carolina, Arizona, Tennessee, and Illinois; police\ndepartments in the United Kingdom and China use it as well.\nThe studies on the effectiveness of predictive policing have been mixed. The Los\nAngeles Police Department claims the technique is twice as accurate as conventional\ncrime forecasting and, after the implementation of predictive policing in Santa Cruz,\nCalifornia, the city realized a 19% drop in the number of burglaries over a six month\nperiod (Friend, 2013).\nHowever, a 2103 RAND Corporation study was more measured:\nPredictive policing methods are not a crystal ball: they cannot foretell the future. They can only identify people\nand locations at increased risk of crime \u2026 the most effective predictive policing approaches are elements of\nlarger pro-active strategies that build strong relationships between police departments and their communities to\nsolve crime problems. (Perry, McInnis, Price, Smith, and Hollywood, 2013: back cover)\nTactical Crime Analysis\nCriminologist Rachel Boba defines \ntactical crime analysis\n as:\nThe study of recent criminal incidents and potential criminal activity by examining characteristics such as how,\nwhen, and where the activity has occurred to assist in problem solving by developing patterns and trends,\nidentifying investigative leads/suspects, and clearing cases. (Boba, 2001: 13)\nMost criminal incidents provide a wealth of material that, if analyzed properly, can help\nsolve the case. For example, if the police are interested in attacking a large drug\norganization, there are several analytical paths they can take. First, they might obtain a\nsuspect\u2019s cellular telephone records to see whom \nhe calls, when he calls them, and for\nhow long they speak. This can provide significant information into an individual\u2019s\nactivities as well as identify the network in which he travels. Additionally, the police can\nscrutinize bank records to determine whether there are any suspicious transactions that\nindicate illegal drug activity. Finally, drug dealing is a business and must be run like any\nother. As a result, traffickers need to keep records of who owes them money, how much\nthey have sold, and to whom they owe money; in many cases, these records are coded in\nthe hope of hiding illegal activity. If these can be obtained, specially trained analysts can\n\u201cdecode\u201d them and explain their meaning. This can be an especially powerful piece of\nevidence.\nComplex criminal organizations can be immense. It would be impossible for an\ninvestigator to keep track of all the individuals in an organization as well as their\nactivities. As a result, special software has been developed to allow analysts to conduct\nsocial network analysis (SNA)\n, in which people and their activities are tracked.\nRelationships, timelines, and incident maps are all used in SNA to assist in\nunderstanding complexity.\n356\nCriminal Investigative Analysis\nOften mistakenly referred to as \u201cbehavioral profiling,\u201d \nCriminal Investigative Analysis\n(CrIA)\n was integrated into American policing by the FBI\u2019s Behavioral Science Unit\n(BSU) in the 1970s. Using both investigative techniques and psychological insights, CrIA\nanalyzes aspects of crime scenes and victim characteristics to gain insights into who may\nhave committed a crime. CrIA is often used in cases involving unusual homicides,\nparticularly those in which there is a peculiar sexual component. It is also used in cases\ninvolving serial murder or sexual assault.\nThe process of CrIA is not complicated, but it does require a certain amount of insight\nand expertise. As a result, \u201cprofilers\u201d are usually seasoned investigators who have spent\nmany years investigating complex criminal matters. In conducting a CrIA, the agent\nseeks to answer three questions:\nWhat\n aspect of the crime potentially provides insight into the perpetrator? (This\nusually involves much more information than the evidence that is introduced at\ntrial).\nWhy\n did the perpetrator act in this particular way? Like everyone else, criminals\nmake choices in the way they behave. The choices they make can often provide\na great deal of information into their thinking process and motivation.\nWho\n would have acted in this manner? Often, information relating to a\nperpetrator\u2019s age, relationship to the victim, level of education, personal habits,\nproximity to the crime scene, and occupation can be determined.\nIt should be noted that CrIA rarely solves a crime\u2014instead, it is another tool that\ninvestigators use to assist them. One early example where CrIA proved successful\ninvolved Wayne Williams, who was accused of murdering several young African-\nAmerican males in Atlanta, Georgia, in the 1980s. The physical evidence linking\nWilliams to the crimes was not overwhelming; in the course of his trial, Williams took\nthe witness stand. A member of the FBI\u2019s BSU had been assisting the prosecutor in the\ncourtroom. Knowing William\u2019s personality, he provided the prosecutor with a series of\nquestions to ask during cross-examination. Williams, who had up to that point remained\ncalm and cool, eventually exploded, yelling at the prosecutor and providing the jurors\nwith a view of his personality that was highly unflattering. He was eventually convicted\nof murder and is currently serving two consecutive life sentences.\nIn the 1980s, Special Agents from the BSU began to interview individuals in prison\nwho had been convicted of violent, serial crimes. After a number of interviews, they\ncame to the conclusion that different offenders often had their own unique ways of\ncommitting offenses. In part, this was because many were driven by unusually violent,\nsexual fantasies. They would act out these fantasies on their victims to the greatest\nextent possible. Because their fantasies usually remained constant over time, they would\ndisplay the same or similar behaviors at each of their crime scenes. This convinced the\n357\nFBI that crime incidents could be linked by behavioral analysis.\nIn general, the Bureau profilers divide crime scene behaviors into one of two\ncategories. The first, termed \nmodus operandi\n (MO)\n, is defined as the behavior\nnecessary to commit the crime. This includes such things as the manner in which the\nperpetrator approached the victim, how he kept his identity from being discovered, and\nhow he affected his escape. But this does not explain other behaviors that often occur in\nthe commission of crimes, especially those that include elements of sexual violence. For\nexample, sometimes individuals kill their victims with far more force and intensity than\nis required (\u201coverkill\u201d). As well, perpetrators might take a small item from the victim to\nhelp them later relive the crime (\u201ctrophy\u201d or \u201csouvenir\u201d). This is referred to as \nritual\nbehavior\n\u2014that activity that was not necessary to commit the crime but which might\nprovide insight into an offender\u2019s motivation and personality. If enough MO and ritual\nbehaviors are discovered, the offender\u2019s \nsignature\n, or their own unique way of\ncommitting the crime, might be revealed. In this way, serial crimes can be linked\ntogether.\nThe FBI put these concepts into practice when it created the \nViolent Criminal\nApprehension Program (ViCAP)\n in 1985. Law enforcement agencies from throughout\nthe United States submit both solved and unsolved cases \nto ViCAP, where they are\nanalyzed and categorized by ViCAP analysts. In this way, if a perpetrator kills victims in\nboth California and New York, the incidents can be linked together. This is especially\nimportant in the United States, which has several thousand law enforcement agencies;\nmany of these are small and rarely communicate with one another. \nBox 13.3\n provides an\nexample from the FBI of a case involving ViCAP analysis.\nBox 13.3\n \nViCAP case Scenario\nBecause of privacy laws, we cannot describe a real-life case in ViCAP. But here is a\nhypothetical scenario that shows how the process works:\nA young woman in Portland, Maine, who frequented a neighborhood gym was\nsexually assaulted and murdered after being abducted one evening from the gym\u2019s\nparking lot as she was leaving. Her body was found several days later in an\nabandoned lot within a mile of the gym. There were no witnesses. Police found\ntraces of chloroform on the ground just outside the woman\u2019s car. After\ninvestigating and clearing all of the woman\u2019s known associates, Portland police\nentered the case into ViCAP Web.\nA ViCAP search for similar cases produced a murder case that had occurred\nthree months earlier in Seattle, Washington. In that case, a young woman was\nabducted after leaving her gym. Her body was later recovered in an empty field\nabout a mile-and-a-half from the gym. No one saw anything, but police found\ntraces of chloroform on the ground outside her car. Thinking it might be the same\nsuspect, the Portland investigator contacted the Seattle investigator to compare\n358\nnotes.\nWhile all this was going on, a ViCAP analyst in Virginia reviewed a newly\nsubmitted case from Great Falls, Minnesota, in which a young woman was\nchloroformed and abducted after exiting her local gym. She was taken to a nearby\npark, raped, beaten, and left for dead. However, she survived and was able to\ndescribe her attacker and a unique tattoo on his forearm. The analyst searched\nViCAP Web for similar cases and came up with the Portland and Seattle homicide\ncases. She quickly notified the Great Falls police about the other two cases.\nBuoyed by the investigative leads generated by ViCAP, the agencies joined forces\nand ultimately tracked down a suspect\u2014a traveling salesman whose trips coincided\nwith the dates of the abductions. His physical appearance, including the tattoo, met\nthe suspect description as provided by the victim in the third attack. A search of his\nhome uncovered traces of chloroform in his kitchen sink, and DNA analysis linked\nhim to all three attacks. Case closed.\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation. (2010). ViCAP case scenario.\nwww.fbi.gov/news/stories/2010/august/vicap-anniversary/vicap_scenario.\nThe FBI\u2019s techniques are not without critics. For example, the Bureau typically divides\nunknown offenders into one of two classes: the \norganized offender\n, whose crime scenes\nusually appear neat as the result of significant planning, and the \ndisorganized offender\n,\nwhose chaotic behavior and messy crime scenes seem unplanned and spur-of-the-\nmoment. Critics contend that most offenders tend to have characteristics from both\ncategories\u2014 to that end, is such a distinction truly valid? In response to the FBI, which\nplaces a great deal of emphasis on investigative experience and savvy, researchers in\nEngland have developed their own version of CrIA, which they call \nInvestigative\nPsychology (IP)\n. IP is more empirically based than CrIA and less dependent on\ninvestigative experience. Both schools of thought have their proponents and detractors.\nRecently, researchers in both camps have begun to work more closely together. Whether\nthis will lead to a blended model is difficult to say.\nGeographic Profiling\nIn the late 1980s, researchers at Simon Frasier University in Canada reasoned that they\ncould use GIS systems not only to predict crime patterns, but also to gain important\ninsights into offenders. They were especially interested in trying to determine a\nperpetrator\u2019s place of residence based on the pattern of crimes committed. They likened\nserial rapists and murderers to animals who \u201chunt\u201d for their prey. Typically, animals do\nnot kill precisely where they live but they also do not wander too far from home, either.\nKim Rossmo, then an officer with the Vancouver Police Department, developed an\nalgorithm to plot an offender\u2019s \u201chome base\u201d based on the pattern of his offenses. Today,\n359\nmany agencies use geographic profiling in the investigation of violent, serial offenses. No\nlonger just limited to rape and murder, proponents claim that geographic profiling can\nhelp solve all manner of crimes, including arson, bombing, and robbery.\nTo date, a rigorous test of geographic profiling has not been performed. According to a\nstudy commissioned by the National Institute of Justice:\nIt is important to stress that geographic profiling does not solve cases, but rather provides a means for managing\nthe large volume of information typically generated in major crime investigations. It should be regarded as one\nof several powerful decision support tools available to the detective and is best employed in conjunction with\nother police methods. Geographic crime patterns are clues that, when properly decoded, can be used to point in\nthe direction of the offender. (Harries, 1999: 154)\n360\nConclusion\nIntelligence in policing agencies has undergone significant change in the past 20 years.\nThe advent of the computer, GIS systems, and better theoretical models has produced a\nrevolution in crime analysis. Law enforcement \nagencies now can process millions of bits\nof information to better understand crime patterns and identify perpetrators. Some\npredict that, in the near future, individual officers will be able to conduct sophisticated\nanalysis by themselves while in the field; this would no doubt further revolutionize the\nprocess.\nIn addition, after the attacks of 9/11, many police departments that had abandoned\nintelligence activities for fear of liability set up their own intel units and began\nparticipating in task forces and fusion centers. Most current policing philosophies, to\ninclude COMPSTAT, Intelligence-Led Policing, and Predictive Policing, rely on some\nform of intelligence collection, processing, and analysis. To that end, it is highly likely\nthat these activities will only increase in the future.\nNot everyone is pleased with the increasing involvement of state and local agencies in\nintelligence gathering. For example, the American Civil Liberties Union has been critical\nof fusion centers, claiming they often overreach the boundaries of what is permitted\nunder the Constitution. As well, many fear that we have become a \u201csurveillance society,\u201d\nwhere privacy in any real sense no longer exists.\nDespite these criticisms, as of this writing two facts remain uncon-tested: (1) the\nUnited States has not suffered a major terrorist event since the 9/11 attacks, and (2) rates\nof violent and property crime have fallen steadily for most areas of the country for the\npast 20 years. Whether this is the direct result of increased law enforcement intelligence\nactivities is open to debate. However, no one in authority seems ready or willing to\nsignificantly curtail the manner in which law enforcement authorities are performing\ntheir jobs. The police will likely be in the intelligence business for some time to come.\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nShould America adopt the British approach and establish a domestic\nintelligence agency like MI-5? Why or why not?\n2\n. \nHow is criminal intelligence different than that practiced by the CIA or DIA?\nHow is it similar?\n3\n. \nHow does the FBI\u2019s CrIA differ from IP? Which approach makes more sense to\nyou? Why?\n4\n. \nSome new forms of analysis, such as geographic profiling, have yet to undergo\nsystematic review to determine whether they actually work. Should this stop\n361\nthe police from using them? Why or why not?\n5\n. \nHow do you think technology will change the manner in which crime analysis\nis conducted in the next 10 years?\n362\nKey Terms\nCommunity Oriented Policing\nCOMPSTAT\nCrime analysis\nCriminal intelligence\nCriminal Investigative Analysis\nCrime mapping\nCrime Prevention through Environmental Design\nDisorganized offender\nGeographic profiling\nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) Program\nHot spots\nIntelligence-Led Policing\nInternational Association of Law Enforcement Intelligence Analysts\nInvestigative Psychology (IP)\nMI-5\nModus operandi\n (MO)\nNational Criminal Intelligence Sharing Plan (NCISP)\nNational Intelligence Model\nOrganized offender\nPredictive Policing\nProblem Oriented Policing (POP)\nRed Squads\nRegional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program\nRitual behavior\nSARA\nSignature\nSocial network analysis (SNA)\nTactical crime analysis\nViolent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP)\nWestern States Information Network\n363\nReferences\nBoba, R.

Before the attacks of 9/11, America felt protected by two oceans\nand the security that its nonthreatening international neighbors to the north and south\nprovided. Since that time, the United States has reexamined and, in many cases,\nredefined the dangers and threats facing the nation. This has led to the major\nrealignments of the intelligence community (IC) described in \nChapter 3\n (\u201cThe IC\nToday\u201d). In a very real way, the attacks woke the United States from the stupor that\nhung on even after the end of the Cold War. If any good came from that horrible day in\n2001, it was that it forced the government to face the realities of the twenty-first century.\nGone were the days when the country faced a single, monolithic adversary. Instead,\nmany widely divergent challenges, everything from climate change to the instability of\nfinancial markets, became an interest and concern of the IC. In \nChapter 15\n (\u201cFuture of\nIntelligence\u201d), we discuss a Director of National Intelligence (DNI) publication titled\nVision 2015\n. Although it is meant as a predictive document, it also identifies many of the\nthreats we face today.\nThe acknowledgment of multiple threats has led the Department of Home-land\nSecurity (DHS) to adopt an \nall-hazards\n approach to emergency management. This\napproach recognizes that disasters, be they man-made and natural, have many things in\ncommon. For example, both tornadoes and nuclear attacks share such things as the need\nfor emergency warnings and mass evacuation. As a result, a general plan\u2014rather than\none that deals individually with each type of disaster\u2014can be designed and\nimplemented. This allows for better coordination and understanding, especially when\nmultiple agencies are involved.\n366\nThreats\nAs the twenty-first century dawned, the United States entered a new era in which the\nglobal dynamics of the bipolar Cold War world were replaced with uncertain and\nevolving threats. Some of these include natural disasters, illicit drug production, border\nsecurity, fragile states, and insurgencies. In the ensuing sections, we discuss these and\nother concerns. Readers should keep in mind that the list is not all-inclusive; other\nchallenges can and do exist.\nNatural Threats\nNatural threats facing the nation include a wide variety of challenges such as hurricanes,\ntornados, earthquakes, and pandemics. Although most of these events are unpredictable,\nthe collection of information, production of \nintelligence, and the development of\nresponse strategies can serve as valuable tools to shape preparations, organize and\ncoordinate planning, define and solve command and control challenges, and thereby\nimprove recovery efforts.\n367\nFigure 14.1\n \nLetter carrier in New York wearing mask for protection against influenza. New York City,\nOctober 16, 1918. (Source: National Archives)\nTake the case of \npandemics\n. Although they are difficult to prevent entirely,\nintelligence can identify disease outbreaks in their early stages, thus allowing them to be\nisolated to particular areas. Even more important, the invention of vaccines has allowed\nus to severely limit the impact of disease. Years ago, polio and smallpox represented a\nhuge threat to populations; today, smallpox has been wiped out and polio cases have\nbeen reduced to a trickle. Historically, pandemics such as the Black Plague of the Middle\nAges, the influenza epidemic of 1918 (see \nFigure 14.1\n), yellow fever, polio, and smallpox\nkilled \nor disabled millions of people worldwide. Advances in communications and\nmedical technology allow for a global response, where the more developed nations lead\nefforts to not only contain the disease, but also to develop response strategies to reduce\nits impact. Recent pandemic fears, such as the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome\n(SARS) outbreak, demonstrated the benefit of disease \u201cearly warning\u201d systems, which\nallowed for a quick response. Accordingly, the impact of the disease was significantly\nreduced. The lead agency in the United States for monitoring diseases is the \nCenters for\nDisease Control and Prevention\n (CDC).\nThe CDC works with a wide range of partners to provide a health surveillance system\nto monitor and prevent disease outbreaks, implement disease prevention strategies, and\n368\nmaintain national health statistics; they would likely be the first agency to recognize a\nbioterror attack. The CDC also guards against international disease transmission and\nstations personnel in more than 25 foreign countries (Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention, 2007).\nPredicting other natural disasters is somewhat more difficult, but not necessarily\nimpossible. The \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\n and the\nPacific Tsunami Warning Center\n both attempt to predict tsunamis based on seismic\nactivity. Likewise, seismologists have worked over the years to develop reliable\nearthquake prediction models, although that has proven elusive.\nFinally, everyone is aware of the \nNational Weather Service\n, which is part of the\nNOAA. It is responsible for tracking routine and severe weather systems, such as\ntornadoes and hurricanes. The potential destructive power of storms is enormous. \nBox\n14.1\n describes 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina and NOAA\u2019s efforts to track its movements and\nrepair the damage it caused.\nIllicit Drug Production and Distribution\nThere are few who would debate that the United States faces a major threat from illicit\ndrugs and the impact related to drug production, distribution, and consumption. Drug\ndependence is a chronic, relapsing disorder that exacts an enormous cost on individuals,\nfamilies, businesses, communities, and the nation. Addicted individuals frequently\nengage in self-destructive and criminal behavior. Billions of dollars have been spent on\nthe struggle against illicit drugs, with much of the funding going to policing. Although\nlaw enforcement efforts have proven to impact the drug cycle, they alone will never\neliminate or even significantly reduce their accessibility or impact of drugs. And\nalthough most law enforcement resources are directed at reducing the supply of illicit\ndrugs, it must be remembered that without \ndemand, there would be no need for supply.\nHumans seem to have a voracious appetite for drugs, ranging from the legal (e.g.,\nalcohol, tobacco, and caffeine) to the illegal (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine,\nmarijuana). According to the United Nations, in 2003, the global drug trade generated an\nestimated $321.6 billion in revenue (Pollard, 2005). Most experts agree that, as long as\nthere is a demand, there will always be someone willing to accept the risks associated\nwith the trade to supply drugs in the hope of extravagant riches.\nBox 14.1\n \nHurricane Katrina\u2014Most Destructive\nHurricane ever to Strike the United States\nOn August 28, 2005, Hurricane Katrina was in the Gulf of Mexico, where it powered\nup to a Category 5 storm on the Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane scale, packing winds\nestimated at 175 mph.\n369\nAt 7:10 A.M. EDT on August 29, Hurricane Katrina made landfall in southern\nPlaquemines Parish Louisiana, just south of Buras, as a Category 3 hurricane.\nMaximum winds were estimated near 125 mph to the east of the center.\nAlthough Katrina will be recorded as the most destructive storm in terms of\neconomic losses, it did not exceed the human losses in storms such as the Galveston\nHurricane of 1900, which killed as many as 6000\u201312,000 people, and led to almost\ncomplete destruction of coastal Galveston.\nHurricane Andrew, in 1992, cost approximately $21 billion in insured losses (in\ntoday\u2019s dollars), whereas estimates from the insurance industry as of late August\n2006, have reached approximately $60 billion in insured losses (including flood\ndamage) from Katrina. The storm could cost the Gulf Coast states as much as an\nestimated $125 billion.\nHundreds of NOAA employees from many divisions of the agency were involved\nwith Hurricane Katrina, which involved forecasting the storm; surveying and\nclearing waterways; responding to oil and chemical spills; and testing fisheries.\nDuring the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, the NOAA P-3 turboprop aircraft flew\naround and into 11 named storms\u2014including Katrina\u2014accounting for 73 missions,\nwhich translates into 480 flight hours. The P-3s also flew into the eyewall of the\nstorms 109 times.\nNOAA\u2019s Gulfstream IV jet flew 50 missions, for a total 389 flight hours.\nNOAA\u2019s Citation aircraft flew 50 aerial photography missions after Hurricanes\nKatrina, Ophelia, and Rita, which amounted to 105 flight hours and thousands of\nhigh-resolution photos of the storms\u2019 damage.\nSource:\n National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (2006). Hurricane\nKatrina. \nwww.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2006/s2690.htm\n.\nAlthough drugs in and of themselves are a problem, it goes much deeper than that.\nNarco-terrorism\n, or using the proceeds of drug sales to fund terrorist groups, is a\npressing issue. 17 of the groups on the State Department\u2019s list of designated \nforeign\nterrorist organizations (FTOs)\n engage in narco-terrorism, according to the Drug\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) (Wagley, 2006).\nThe proceeds of drug trafficking are so large and the cartels so powerful, that they\nactually undermine the security of some sovereign nations. Consider the situation in\nMexico as of early 2016. The government is engaged in what some have described as an\n\u201cinsurgency,\u201d where drug gangs use military-grade weapons against the police and other\nlaw enforcement authorities. It is routine to discover decapitated bodies and mass graves\njust across the U.S.\u2013 Mexico border. Some officials worry that it is only a matter of time\nbefore the violence will spill over into the United States.\nSome drugs, such as marijuana and methamphetamine, can be grown or produced in\nthe United States. Others, such as heroin and cocaine, originate in foreign countries and\nmust be imported. Because drugs originate both domestically and internationally, and\n370\ngiven their reach and influence into corruption and terrorism, virtually every IC agency\nhas a stake in the game. The CIA, FBI, DEA, and military agencies have regular working\ngroups and task forces that meet to address the problem. The National Geospatial-\nIntelligence Agency provides geospatial intelligence of poppy fields from the air,\nwhereas the Treasury Department analyzes suspected drug and money laundering\nrecords.\nDespite the best efforts of the IC and law enforcement and a so-called \u201cWar on Drugs\u201d\nthat has existed in the United States since the 1980s, the trends are not encouraging.\nAccording to the United Nations\u2019 International Narcotics Control Board, the United\nStates is the main destination point for illicit drug shipments. Furthermore, as of 2009, an\nincrease in the abuse of all drugs, with the exception of cocaine, was reported. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, the greatest threat was prescription drug abuse (Huffington Post, 2011).\nBorder Security and Immigration Issues\nThe length of America\u2019s borders makes them virtually impossible to close physically;\nonce access to the nation is achieved, individuals can move with relative freedom (see\nFigure 14.2\n). To that end, securing the border and transportation systems of the United\nStates continues to pose an enormous challenge. Land ports-of-entry into America\nstretch across 7500 miles; furthermore, there are 95,000 miles of shoreline and navigable\nrivers and an exclusive economic zone of 3.4 million square miles. To put the challenge\ninto perspective, on a typical day, more than 1.1 million passengers and pedestrians,\nincluding more than 630,000 aliens, are processed at the nation\u2019s borders. This includes\n235,000 air passengers, more than 333,000 privately owned vehicles, and more than\n79,000 shipments of goods. In one year, more than 500 million people, 130 million motor\nvehicles, 2.5 million railcars, and 5.7 million cargo containers are processed at the border\n(United States Customs and Border Protection, n.d.).\n371\nFigure 14.2\n A Customs and Border Patrol Field Operations Officer observes one of the many cargo ships that\nenter U.S. ports every year. (Source: U.S. Customs and Border Patrol)\nNeedless to say, the sheer numbers involved are staggering. Whereas the per capita\neconomy and living conditions in Canada are similar to that of the United States, the\nsame cannot be said of Mexico. The economic opportunities south of America\u2019s border\ngenerally pale in comparison to those in the United States. There is much poverty in\nMexico, and many of its citizens are motivated to travel to America for jobs or a better\nquality of life. Although many migrate legally, others exploit weaknesses in border\nsecurity and enter the United States illegally. Although it is impossible to know how\nmany illegal immigrants currently reside in the United States, estimates vary between\nseven and 20 million (Knickerbocker, 2006). Some of these individuals are \u201cday laborers\u201d\nwho perform jobs in the United States during the day and return to Mexico at night.\nOthers hope to remain permanently.\nMany of these illegal workers perform rudimentary blue-collar jobs, often at very low\nwages. Given their illegal status, they are usually paid \u201coff the \nbooks\u201d in cash. This\nmeans that employers do not pay Social Security or other taxes for them. Given their\nhuge numbers, illegal workers have become a large part of some sectors of the American\neconomy. Despite this, many critics complain that they receive governmental services,\nsuch as schooling and health care, without paying for them. This, they maintain, is\nunfair.\nIn addition, law enforcement and intelligence agencies worry that terrorists and\ncriminals can also exploit the porous border. A large portion of the illicit drugs used in\nthe United States are imported from Mexico; this underscores just how difficult it is to\nachieve total protection.\nThere is no single effective solution that will address the border security challenge. As\nlong as the United States is viewed as a land of both legal and illegal opportunity,\nindividuals and their families will flow into the nation. Although many agencies have\nborder protection duties, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) maintains overall\nfederal responsibility. Its primary agencies for customs enforcement and border security\ninclude four different organizations:\nThe \nUnited States Coast Guard\n is both a military and a law enforcement\nagency. It protects America\u2019s maritime borders, enforces laws on the high seas,\nand performs life-saving duties. It is also a member of the IC.\nThe \nUnited States Customs and Border Protection (CBP)\n has inspection and\nenforcement agents who regulate goods coming into the country. The\norganization also includes the U.S. Border Patrol, whose mission is to guard\nAmerica\u2019s borders and keep out illegal immigrants.\nThe \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services\n carries out many of\nthe administrative functions associated with immigration. For example, it\nadjudicates asylum cases, issues temporary work permits, and grants permanent\n372\nresident and citizenship status.\nThe \nUnited States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\n is another\nlaw enforcement organization responsible for enforcing immigration laws. Its\nagents detect and remove illegal aliens and investigate criminal matters relating\nto illegal immigration.\nThe above agencies represent only the federal effort directed at border enforcement.\nMany state, local, and other organizations are also involved. Cutting-edge technologies,\nsuch as thermal imaging cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles, and border fences are\nroutinely used. Despite the enormous investment in both personnel and equipment, the\nborder remains porous.\nAlthough the Mexican border draws a great deal of scrutiny, experts are also\nconcerned with Canada. For example, in May 2011, CBP Commissioner Alan Bersin told\na U.S. Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Immigration, \nRefugees, and Border Security\nthat, in terms of the terrorist threat, Canada represented a bigger challenge than Mexico,\nin part because the United States and Canada do not share terrorist \u201cno-fly\u201d lists (Freeze,\n2011).\nIn 2005, DHS established the \nSecure Border Initiative (SBI)\n, a comprehensive,\nmultiyear plan to help better control America\u2019s borders. The SBI\u2019s mission is to develop,\ndeploy, and integrate technology and tactical infrastructure in support of CBP\u2019s efforts to\ngain and maintain effective control of border areas.\nIn 2016, Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. One of his\ncampaign pledges was to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to halt\nillegal immigration; he also promised to deport many undocumented aliens currently\nliving in the United States. Whether he achieves these ends, and what effect(s) it may\nhave on U.S. safety and security, remain open questions.\nTransnational Organized Crime\nThe end of the Cold War, combined with increasing globalization, has enabled many\ncriminal organizations to expand their reach across international boundaries. They have\nbenefitted from the weakening of governments, such as Russia, where serious organized\ncrime has flourished. Additionally, failed and failing governments in Africa and\nelsewhere have given rise to all sorts of criminal activity, including narcotics and arms\nsmuggling, trafficking in persons, counterfeiting, money laundering, and sea piracy.\nJust as legitimate business has profited from the opening of borders and the shared\nglobal economy, so too have transnational criminal organizations. Many have developed\ninnovative strategies, driven by rapid technological developments, such as the internet\nand ubiquitous, instant communications.\nDefinitions of transnational organized crime often differentiate between traditional\ncrime organizations and more modern criminal networks. Traditional groups have\n373\nhierarchical structures that operate continuously or for an extended period. Newer\nnetworks, in contrast, are seen as having a more decentralized, often cell-like structure\n(Wagley, 2006).\nTransnational and organized crime has proven to have a damaging effect on political\nstructures, especially the fragile new systems of government found in the former\ncommunist or totalitarian regimes. South American drug cartels, for example, work to\ndestabilize governments through their financial support of local guerilla rebels, such as\nthe Send-ero Luminoso in Peru and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia. \nIn\nsome cases, the corruption that accompanies the huge profits of criminal activities goes\nall the way to the top of government; for example, Vladimiro Montesinos, head of Peru\u2019s\nnational intelligence and antinarcotics efforts between 1990 and 2000, was imprisoned,\ncharged with running major international drug, weapons, and money laundering\noperations (Wagley, 2006).\nThe effect that corruption can have on a population is staggering. Surveys indicate\nthat many Russians believe the \u201cmafiya\u201d is more powerful than the government. As\npeople feel that the government is powerless to stop organized crime, they turn to crime\nleaders for protection, and political institutions begin to deteriorate (Stephens, 1996).\nThe international economic threat posed by transnational organized crime in an\nincreasingly global economy is among the major \u201cnew\u201d threats to international security.\nCooperation among crime groups has increased as restrictions have lessened between\ninternational borders. Whereas many terrorist groups are motivated by specific political\ncauses, most organized crime factions only care about political power for the security it\nprovides their organization as they pursue their financial goals.\nAccording to Louise I. Shelley, Director of the Terrorism, Transnational Crime and\nCorruption Center:\n[Organized crime] will be a defining issue of the 21st century as the Cold War was for the 20th century \u2026 No\narea of international affairs will remain untouched as political and economic systems and the social fabric of\nmany countries will deteriorate. (Shelley, 2007)\nExperts fear that organized criminals will help terrorists or rogue nations acquire\nweapons of mass destruction (WMDs); the gravest concern is that some of these factions\nmay gain access to nuclear weapons. As Deborah Yarsike Ball of the Lawrence\nLivermore Laboratory explains:\nCrime in the military is on the rise and further fuels concern over the security of nuclear weapons in Russia \u2026\nEmbezzlement is common and includes the sale of weapons, munitions and any other property. Military\npersonnel sell Stinger-type weapons, air-to-ground missiles, tanks and planes\u2014basically anything that can be\nmoved. (Ball, 1999: 4)\nIn terms of the reach of organized crime, one pundit notes:\nIn 2009, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated that transnational organized crime (TOC)\nactivities were valued at $870 billion, or approximately 1.5 percent of global GDP. Today, TOC value is well\nabove $1 trillion per year. (D\u2019Alfonso, 2014)\n374\nHuman Trafficking\nAlthough it has maintained a low profile in the United States, human trafficking has\nemerged as an enormous threat in many other countries of the world. People are sold\ninto slavery for a variety of reasons: often, it is for the sex trade, but it can also be for\nother types of forced labor. Criminal groups choose to traffic in persons, in part, because\nit is high-profit and often low risk\u2014unlike other \u201ccommodities\u201d people can be used\nrepeatedly, and trafficking does not require a large capital investment (Bales & Lize,\n2005).\nAccording to the FBI, human trafficking is big business, generating $9.5 billion\nannually. People sold for sexual purposes are predominantly women and girls; perhaps\nsurprisingly, in 30% of the countries that provided information, women themselves are\nthe predominant traffickers. An estimated 600,000 to 800,000 people are smuggled across\ninternational borders annually; when domestic trafficking is included, the number swells\nto between two and four million. About 14,500 to 17,500 people are thought to be\nsmuggled into the United States annually, mainly from Southeast Asia and the former\nSoviet Union (Wagley, 2006).\nWorldwide, almost 20% of all trafficking victims are children. However, in some parts\nof Africa and the Mekong region, they represent the majority (up to 100% in parts of\nWest Africa). Although trafficking seems to imply people moving across continents,\nmost exploitation takes place close to home. Data show intraregional and domestic\ntrafficking are the major forms of trafficking (United Nations Office on Drugs and\nCrime, 2009).\nAlthough human trafficking into the United States has not yet risen to the levels\npredicted by experts, the government is not sitting by idly. The \nTrafficking Victims\nProtection Act\n that was passed in 2000 provides strict penalties for trafficking for forced\nlabor or servitude and/or for sexual exploitation. Recognizing that these crimes are\nglobal problems, the law established the \nOffice to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in\nPersons\n in the State Department to oversee international efforts. The Act criminalizes\nprocuring and subjecting another human being to peonage, slavery, involuntary\nservitude, or forced labor, and provides social services and legal benefits to survivors of\nthese crimes, including authorization to remain in the country (Bales & Lize, 2005).\nThe State Department is not the only government agency involved in anti-trafficking\nefforts. Other organizations, including the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security,\nHealth and Human Services, and Labor, also play key roles. For example, within ICE, the\nOffice of Investigations has an entire division, the Smuggling/Trafficking Branch, which\ndisrupts and prosecutes criminal organizations involved in human smuggling.\nIntellectual Property Theft\nAn issue that many Americans rarely consider as a threat involves the theftof\n375\nintellectual property (IP). According to Interpol, trade in counterfeit goods has grown\neight times faster than legitimate trade since the early 1990s. American businesses\nestimate that counterfeiting costs them between $200 and $250 billion per year in lost\nsales. In China, industry estimates place piracy levels in many sectors at about 90%\n(Wagley, 2006).\nThe Office of the United States Trade Representative leads other agencies, including\nthe Departments of Commerce, State, Justice, and Homeland Security, in combating IP\nviolations.\nCyber Security\nOne grave concern for many policymakers today involves the safety and security of the\ncyber security infrastructure. Currently, a significant amount of commerce is conducted\nonline. Moreover, many important systems, such as electrical grids and other utilities,\nare controlled through the internet. A significant attack on our cyber capabilities, what\nhas been described as a \nCyber Pearl Harbor\n, could be catastrophic.\nCyber security takes many different forms. On a personal level, most individuals\nknow of at least one person who has been victimized by \nidentity theft\n. Cyber-savvy\nthieves have developed skills to \u201csteal\u201d another\u2019s name and identifying data, which in\nturn, allows them to obtain credit cards, loans, and other items of value. Often, a person\ndoes not realize that their identity has been stolen until well after the fact. In such a case,\nthe thief may have made off with thousands of dollars in illicit purchases. According to\nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2014, an estimated 17.6 million people, or 7% of all U.S.\nresidents age 16 or older, were victims of identity theft(Harrell, 2015).\nAnother cyber weapon is \nhacktivism\n, where computers are used to advance political\ngoals or settle personal grudges. Hacktivists often vandalize websites of organizations\nwith which they disagree\u2014the U.S. military and CIA are often targets of hacktivist\nattacks. Another tactic hackers use involves \ndenial of service (DOS) attacks\n, where\nwebsites are overwhelmed by so many external queries that their servers crash. Targets\nof DOS attacks are often banks, large corporations, and government agencies.\nAs annoying as hacktivism and identity theftcan be, what really worries policymakers\nis the potential for a systemic collapse. It is not only individuals and groups that have\nengaged in cyber attacks. Increasingly, it appears that countries are supporting or\nthemselves carrying out operations. In July 2011, the Defense Department (DoD) released\nits \nStrategy for Operating\n \nin Cyberspace\n, where it described cyberspace in terms usually\nreserved for battlefields:\nNational security is being redefined by cyberspace. In addition to opportunities, DoD faces significant\ncyberspace challenges. The Department\u2019s military, intelligence, and business operations all depend upon\ncyberspace for mission success. (Department of Defense, 2011: 13)\nIn addition to the DoD, the National Security Agency has defined \ninformation\nassurance\n, or the protection of systems, as part of its core mission. And they are not\n376\nalone\u2014virtually every IC agency is involved in some aspect of cyberspace, whether to\ngather information, keep tabs on adversaries, or strengthen defenses. \nChapter 15\n (\u201cFuture\nof Intelligence\u201d) discusses the future of cyber security at some length.\nWeapons Trafficking\nOver the past century, wars and conflicts have occurred in almost every part of the\nworld. As a result, millions of weapons and countless tons of military-related equipment\nhave flooded the world markets. Even some of the poorest nations have invested their\nlimited national wealth in these items.\nAfter World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union began developing and\nassembling scores of conventional and nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.\nProliferation\n refers to the spread of weapons and weapons related technology to others\nwho do not currently possess it. Today, even small and technologically poor countries\nhave the capability to produce chemical, biological, radiological, and, increasingly,\nnuclear weapons. Recall that one of the major justifications for the U.S. invasion of Iraq\nin 2003 was the fear that Saddam Hussein would provide some of these types of weapons\nto terrorists. Of course, a nuclear device in the hands of a terrorist group such as al\nQa\u2019ida is every American\u2019s worst nightmare. There are two major distinctions in\nweapons that are proliferated. One involves \nconventional weapons\n, such as guns and\nsmall explosives. The other involves \nWMDs\n. WMDs are usually broken down into the\nfollowing different types:\nChemical\nBiological\nRadiological\nNuclear\nHigh Explosives\nAs the name implies, WMDs are designed to kill large numbers of people. At one time,\nexperts believed that terrorist groups would not resort to using \nWMDs out of fear that\nthey would alienate others from accepting their cause. Many of today\u2019s groups, such as\nal Qa\u2019ida, have no such qualms\u2014they see themselves engaged in a \u201choly war\u201d where\nlarge body counts are desirable. WMDs are often referred to by the acronym \nCBRNE\n,\nwhich refers to the different types of weapons named above.\nConventional Weapons\nAlthough WMDs are of great concern, by far the largest numbers of weapons that are\nproliferated are of the conventional variety. The twentieth century proved to be a\ncentury of war and warfare. When combined with the increased industrial capacities of\n377\nthe major powers and the surpluses available after each conflict, it is small wonder that\nthe world became flooded with weapons and equipment. It is estimated that as many as\n100 million AK-47 rifles have been produced and distributed worldwide (Fox News,\n2007). As a result, military forces, insurgents, terrorists, rebels, drug traffickers, and\ncriminal gangs have found that even in the nations with the most restrictive firearms-\nrelated legislation, weapons and military related equipment can be obtained.\nConsider how easily weapons can flow across borders. A 2003 RAND Corporation\nstudy found that Colombian insurgents, armed with huge drug profits, were able to\npurchase weapons through Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and Panama with ease\n(Cragin & Hoffman, 2003). This pattern of weapon flow replays itself in Africa, other\nparts of South America, and Asia\u2014any place where money and violence combine to fuel\ninsurgencies or major criminal activity.\nChemical Weapons\nChemical warfare (CW)\n is the use of chemical substances to inflict physical harm on\nothers. In today\u2019s world, the availability of toxic materials is nearly universal. Consider\nthe chlorine used in swimming pools\u2014it can be easily transformed into chlorine gas,\nwhich killed thousands in World War I.\nAs the above example makes clear, toxic materials are not difficult to manufacture or\nobtain. However, for something to be transformed into a weapon, two conditions must\nbe present: the agent itself must be sufficiently toxic, and a proper means to deliver it\nmust exist. Often, it is the latter condition that is difficult to meet. Consider the case of\nAum Shinrikyo, a religious group that released sarin nerve agent in the Tokyo subway\nsystem in 1995. The goal of the group was to kill thousands, and sarin, a highly toxic\nsubstance, could have done the trick. Fortunately, their delivery system\u2014poking holes in\nplastic bags that contained the substance\u2014proved crude and largely ineffective; in the\nend, 13 people died and several more were injured.\nBiological Weapons\nLike CW, \nbiological warfare (BW)\n uses substances to injure others. However, unlike\nchemical agents, biological pathogens are alive and can multiply. This means two things:\n(1) they can live inside a person for some time before they reach sufficient critical mass\nto be recognized and do harm, and (2) some can spread easily from person-to-person.\nThis makes biological agents extremely dangerous. It is quite possible that terrorists or\nothers could release a biological attack, and it would be several days before anyone\nnoticed. During this period, a highly transmittable agent could infect thousands.\nFortunately, many biological weapons are generally difficult to manufacture. Most\nrequire special laboratories that, to date, have been beyond the reach of the average\n378\nterrorist group. BW agents can be more toxic than CW nerve agents on a weight-for-\nweight basis and can potentially provide broader coverage per pound of payload. BW\nattacks can also be masked as naturally occurring epidemics due to the presence of BW\nagents such as \nBacillus anthracis\n (anthrax) in the environment. In 2001, just one week\nafter the attacks of 9/11, letters containing anthrax were mailed to several news media\noffices and two Democratic U.S. Senators. Five people died and another 17 were infected\n(for the FBI\u2019s report on the case, see \nBox 14.2\n).\nBecause of its clandestine nature, biological terrorism has the potential of instilling\ngreat fear in a population, because no one knows whether they have been attacked or\nnot. This also makes them an ideal weapon to use when perpetrating a hoax. In the\n1990s, a group calling itself the Army of God sent envelopes containing white powder to\nseveral abortion clinics, claiming it was anthrax. Although the attacks turned out to be a\nhoax, they terrified thousands and wasted the valuable time and resources of police,\nmedical personnel, and other first responders.\nNuclear and Radiological Weapons\nDocuments discovered in the possession of al Qa\u2019ida agents indicate the organization\u2019s\ndesire to obtain nuclear weapons; moreover, the late Osama bin Laden proclaimed it a\n\u201creligious duty\u201d that his followers attempt to obtain and employ such weapons.\nThere are two ways that nuclear materials can be weaponized. The first involves a\nfission or fusion-produced explosion of tremendous magnitude. The first and only time\nsuch weapons have ever been used against another country was the U.S. bombing of\nHiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. This is not to say that other countries do\nnot possess nuclear arms. \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d)\ndescribes in detail how they became a focal point of the Cold War. \nTable 14.1\n provides a\nlist of \ncountries believed to possess nuclear weapons or have them under development.\nThe source of the list is the Council on Foreign Relations, a widely respected think tank\nthat gives these matters great deliberation.\nBox 14.2\n \nFBI\u2019s Description of the Amerithrax\nInvestigation\nSoon after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, letters laced with anthrax began appearing\nin the U.S. mail. Five Americans were killed and 17 were sickened in what became\none of the worst biological attacks in U.S. history. The ensuing investigation by the\nFBI and its partners\u2014code-named \u201cAmerithrax\u201d\u2014has been one of the largest and\nmost complex in the history of law enforcement.\nIn August 2008, Department of Justice and FBI officials announced a\nbreakthrough in the case and released documents and information showing that\n379\ncharges were about to be brought against Dr. Bruce Ivins, who took his own life\nbefore those charges could be filed. On February 19, 2010, the Justice Department,\nthe FBI, and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service formally concluded the investigation\ninto the 2001 anthrax attacks and issued an Investigative Summary.\nThe Amerithrax Task Force\u2014which consisted of roughly 25 to 30 full-time\ninvestigators from the FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and other law\nenforcement agencies, as well as federal prosecutors from the District of Columbia\nand the Justice Department\u2019s Counterterrorism Section\u2014 expended hundreds of\nthousands of investigator work hours on this case. Their efforts involved more than\n10,000 witness interviews on six different continents, the execution of 80 searches,\nand the recovery of more than 6,000 items of potential evidence. The case involved\nthe issuance of more than 5,750 grand jury subpoenas and the collection of 5,730\nenvironmental samples from 60 site locations. In addition, new scientific methods\nwere developed that ultimately led to the break in the case\u2014methods that could\nhave a far-reaching impact on future investigations.\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation, n.d., \nwww.fbi.gov/history/famous-\ncases/amerithrax-or-anthrax-investigation\n.\nFortunately, developing nuclear weapons is quite difficult, currently beyond the reach\nof many countries. However, it should be noted that the \u201cNuclear Club\u201d is growing. As\nTable 14.1\n demonstrates, and recent events have underscored, Iran gave indications that\nit is developing nuclear weapons. Many experts are convinced that either the United\nStates or Israel will take steps to prevent this from happening. Some, in fact, believe it is\nhappening already. In 2010, a sophisticated and destructive computer virus called\nStuxnet was discovered on computers engaged in the Iranian \nnuclear enrichment effort.\nIt is widely believed that either the United States or Israel engineered the virus, although\nneither has admitted to it. There are concerns that, if all other efforts fail, Israel or the\nUnited States will launch an attack on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities. Many worry this could\nbring about a devastating war or unleash terrorism on a global scale. In 2015, Iran and a\ngroup of world powers reached an agreement termed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of\nAction that would limit Iran\u2019s ability to produce a nuclear weapon. As of this writing,\nwhether this plan will work is still being debated.\nTable 14.1\n The Nuclear Club\nThe Nuclear Club\nThe first five countries to develop and test nuclear weapons, widely considered the \u201cBig\nFive\u201d nuclear powers:\nUnited States\nRussia\nBritain\n380\nFrance\nChina\nOther countries that have tested or are widely believed to possess nuclear weapons:\nIsrael\nIndia\nPakistan\nNorth Korea\nCountries that could potentially produce nuclear weapons or are believed to have a\nweapons development program:\nIran\nJapan\nSouth Korea\nTaiwan\nEgypt\nSource:\n Sutcliffe, K. (2006). The growing nuclear club. \nCouncil on Foreign\nRelations.\nwww.cfr.org/proliferation/growing-nuclear-club/p12050#p3\n.\nNuclear material does not have to explode to cause destruction. The radiation it\ngenerates can be deadly to humans as well. In addition, because it dissipates slowly, the\ndestructive potential radiation unleashes can last for hundreds of years. Experts maintain\nthat a device that distributes radiation could be used to great effect by terrorists. The\nmost efficient way to achieve \nthis would be by constructing a \ndirty bomb\n\u2014a\nconventional explosive surrounded by nuclear material. The explosion could disperse\nradiation over a wide area, killing people and contaminating property. This is the\nradiological weapon\n mentioned above.\nWhereas nuclear devices are difficult to build, radiological ones are not. There is a\ngreat deal of nuclear material that surrounds us. Consider the x-ray equipment that\ndoctors and hospitals operate; materials from discarded machines could be used to\nconstruct a dirty bomb. Terrorism experts believe that the primary effects of a\nradiological weapon would be psychological. Although the device would likely not kill\nmany people, the fear it produced could prove devastating.\nThe risk of nuclear smuggling was highlighted in October 2003, when officials in\ninternational intelligence and law enforcement discovered that Pakistani nuclear\nscientist A.Q. Khan was selling nuclear technology to North Korea and Libya (Wagley,\n2006).\nExplosives\nThe attack on the Murrah Federal Building in 1995 by Timothy McVeigh convinced\nmany that explosives needed to be added to the list of WMDs. Of great significance,\nMcVeigh\u2019s bomb was not made from sophisticated, difficult-to-obtain materials. Instead,\nhe mixed ammonium nitrate fertilizer, nitromethane, and diesel fuel. In the days after\n381\nthe Oklahoma City and 9/11 attacks, steps were taken to make bomb-making materials\nmore difficult to obtain. However, this is an exceptionally difficult task. At present, there\nare plenty of items that a determined terrorist, insurgent, or criminal can use to cause\nmayhem.\nTerrorism\nThere are many definitions of terrorism. Most include elements of premeditated violence,\noften against noncombatant targets, for a political, social, or religious cause. Terrorist\nacts are usually carried out to influence an audience; as such, the people who are\nwounded or killed may, in fact, be considered secondary targets by the terrorist.\nSince the attacks of 9/11, preventing terrorism has become the number one priority for\nmost IC agencies. Indeed, the United States considers it to be such an important goal that\nit has fought two wars and completely reorganized the federal government in the hopes\nof stopping the next 9/11.\nThe U.S. government divides terrorism into one of two categories\u2014 international or\ndomestic. As discussed in \nChapter 2\n (\u201cHistory of Intelligence in the United States\u201d), the\nFBI defines international terrorism as that which occurs primarily outside the territorial\njurisdiction of the United States or is caused by groups that were formed and operate\nprimarily outside of U.S. borders. An example of this type of group would be al Qa\u2019ida.\nDomestic groups, on the other hand, are those that are formed and operate primarily\ninside the United States, such as the Ku Klux Klan.\nWith regard to international terrorism, the Department of State is required by law to\nprovide a list of countries that the United States believes to be \nsponsors of terror\n along\nwith groups it designates as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTO). The publication in\nwhich the lists appear, \nReports on Terrorism\n, was used as a source for the following\nsection (United States Department of State, 2016). As of 2016, the state sponsors of terror\nwere judged to be:\nSudan\nSyria\nIran\nRadical Islamic Groups\nThe list of FTOs is quite extensive, composed of 58 separate organizations. The vast\nmajority are radical Islamic groups, such as Al-Qa\u2019ida (AQ) in the Islamic Maghreb,\nJemaah Islamiya, and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, now more commonly\nreferred to as just the Islamic State (IS). This should come as a surprise to no one. Few\nwould argue against naming radical Islam as the greatest terrorist threat facing the\nUnited States today. As the 9/11 attacks brutally illustrated, AQ will refrain from\n382\nnothing, including the murder of children and other innocents, to accomplish its goals.\nFortunately for the United States, the past several years have not been good for AQ.\nThe most significant victory, of course, was the killing of Osama bin Laden in May 2011\n(see \nBox 3.2\n for a description of how the IC was instrumental in carrying this out). In\naddition, several of bin Laden\u2019s senior lieutenants have been killed or captured.\nAlthough AQ still maintains training camps in the lawless Pakistani frontier, it is not the\norganization it was several years ago. Many believe that its power today is its ideology,\nwhich continues to spread across the internet in the hopes of recruiting \u201chomegrown\u201d\nterrorists, such as U.S. Army Major Nidal Hasan, who stands accused of murdering 13\nfellow soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.\nBy 2014, analysts believed that a combination of law enforcement, intelligence, and\nmilitary power had weakened AQ significantly. For some time, the group once\ncontrolled by Osama bin Laden had failed to carry out a large-scale attack against the\nWest. However, in that year, a new and unexpected threat arose\u2014the \nIslamic State in\nIraq and Syria (ISIS)\n, also known as the \nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)\nand, more recently, the \nIslamic State (IS)\n. ISIS was not a completely new phenomenon;\nits roots can be traced back as far as 1999. At one point, its leadership swore allegiance to\nAQ. However, that relationship eventually ended and both groups have been in\ncompetition in recent years to emerge as the dominant force in radical Islam.\nISIS was able to exploit the power vacuum brought about by the Syrian Civil War and\nthe lack of coherent military authority in northwestern Iraq. In an amazingly short\nperiod of time, ISIS seized large chunks of territory in both Syria and Iraq. Unlike the\nshadowy AQ and its affiliates, which generally operate in secret like most terrorist\norganizations, ISIS acts more like a traditional nation state. Within a short period of\ntime, its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, proclaimed an ISIS Caliphate in eastern Syria and\nnorthwestern Iraq.\nWhile both ISIS and AQ draw inspiration from their interpretations of radical Islamic\ntheology, they operate quite differently. As mentioned previously, in 2014, ISIS\nproclaimed that it had reestablished the Caliphate. This was a major declaration\u2014the\nfirst Caliphate was established in the 632 AD by the successor to the prophet\nMohammed. According to Professor John Esposito of Georgetown University:\nHistorically, the caliph was the successor to the prophet, the political leader of the community, and therefore the\nhead of the early transnational Islamic empire. That\u2019s important\u2014the idea of it being a transnational empire, that\nreflected the \nummah\n, and transcended national boundaries. (Hafiz, 2014)\nAQ also has the goal of establishing a Caliphate\u2014however, unlike ISIS, it does not\nbelieve the preconditions yet exist for that to happen (Osama bin Laden never declared\nhimself a caliph).\nLike any nation-state, ISIS attempts to carry out governance in the areas it controls.\nThis includes the brutal implementation of its version of Sharia law, as well as\noverseeing schools and hospitals. Its brutality can be seen quite clearly through its own\nslickly produced videos, which depict beheadings and immolations of adversaries.\n383\nBy 2015, many countries, to include the United States and Russia, were actively\nattacking ISIS through airstrikes and other military action. For its part, ISIS promised to\nretaliate against its enemies through terrorist attacks. To date, ISIS has made good on its\nthreats. Between 2013 and June 2016, the group carried out over 70 attacks in 20 different\ncountries; two of the more egregious included the 2016 coordinated bombings in Belgium\nthat left32 victims dead and the November 13, 2015 Paris attacks where 130 were killed.\nFor a time, America seemed secure from ISIS threats. For one, Europe has supplied\nmany more fighters to ISIS than has the United States; experts warn these expatriate\nfighters could return and carry out attacks once their period of service in Iraq or Syria\nends. However, most terrorism experts and analysts thought it was only a matter of time\nbefore the group would make good on its threats to attack America. On May 3, 2015, two\narmed men attempted to carry out an attack at an exhibition featuring cartoon images of\nMuhammad at the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland, Texas; both were shot dead by\npolice before they had a chance to seriously injure anyone. ISIS later claimed credit for\nthis attack, although authorities have been unable to determine if the individuals were\naffiliated with or inspired by ISIS.\nOn December 2, 2015, 14 people were killed and 22 were seriously injured in a attack\nat the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino, California carried out by the husband\nand wife team of Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik. Again, ISIS claimed credit for\ninspiring the duo and, again, authorities could not say definitively whether the attack\nwas ISIS inspired (\nFigure 14.3\n).\nAdditionally, on June 12, 2016, lone gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 and injured 53 in\nan attack on Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. During the attack, which\nincluded a three-hour standoff, Mateen called authorities and pledged allegiance to ISIS\nand its leader, al-Baghdadi.\nFigure 14.3\n \nFBI Director James Comey and Attorney General Loretta Lynch speak about the mass shooting in\nSan Bernardino, CA. (Source: FBI)\n384\nOf note, each of the three American attacks described above was not carried out\ndirectly by ISIS fighters\u2014instead, they were carried out by individuals who were\nallegedly influenced and radicalized, often via the internet, by ISIS and its leaders. This\nlargely long-distance radicalization process especially worries authorities. It makes it\nmore difficult for law enforcement and intelligence agencies to identify individuals who\nmay receive, but not transmit, jihadist rhetoric and allegiance. As well, it extends the\nscope of influence of groups like ISIS.\nTo be sure, ISIS has masterfully used social media to attract followers and spread its\nmessage. From its professional appearing online magazine \nDabiq\n to its horrifying but\nwell produced beheading videos, ISIS has managed to capture the imagination of\nthousands around the globe; its reach has been especially effective among young people.\nIn 2015, the Soufan Group, a think tank that specializes in researching terrorism,\nestimated that between \u201c27,000 and 31,000 people have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join\nthe Islamic State and other violent extremist groups from at least 86 countries\u201d (Soufan\nGroup, 2015: 4).\nWhile it may be difficult to understand, the sheer brutality of ISIS\u2019s videos likely\nserves as a strong recruiting tool for the organization. For example, in 2014, ISIS released\na video of its beheading of American photojournalist James Foley; while most who saw\nthe video were rightly outraged and repulsed, a surprising minority displayed joy and\npride. After the release of the video, one follower tweeted, \u201cthe honour of the ummah\n[nation] is coming back,\u201d while another stated, \u201cDawla\u2019s [ISIS] war with the US is\nsowing the ranks of the mujahedeen back together\u201d (Katz, 2014).\nIn order to reverse the large territorial gains made by ISIS in Iraq and Syria, both the\nUnited States and Iran began separate air campaigns against the group in 2014. Russia\nbegan its own air campaign in 2015. While it may seem strange that these three countries\nwould form a de facto alliance against any group, that just underscores the complexities\nof the Middle East. By mid-2016, a revitalized Iraqi army, bolstered by various militias\nand other groups, had successfully retaken territory that ISIS had seized a few years\nearlier.\nBoth ISIS and AQ can be viewed as components of a single struggle, what some\nexperts have dubbed the Global Jihad (GJ). Basically, the GJ can be viewed as a\ncampaign by radical Salafist Islamists to reconstitute the Caliphate that was established\nafter the death of Mohammed. At present, numerous factions in many countries can be\nconsidered part of the GJ. Indeed, many experts believe that ISIS and AQ are currently\nengaged in a struggle for the \u201chearts and minds\u201d of radical Salafists; they worry that\neach group may try to outdo the other in terms of mass casualty events directed at the\nWest in order to gain dominance.\nOther Terrorist Groups and Movements\nThe end of the Cold War did not spell an end to Communism. Indeed, eight groups on\n385\nthe State Department terrorism list are considered to be inspired by Marxism\u2013Leninism.\nThese include the Communist Party of Philippines, the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK),\nand the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its initials, FARC.\nWhile FARC remains on the list, on November 24, 2016, its leaders signed an historic\npeace deal with the government of Colombia. If successful, this deal will end over 50\nyears of hostilities between the two groups in a conflict that witnessed the deaths of an\nestimated 200,000 people. However, according to Cynthia J. Arnson, who directs the\nLatin America program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars: \u201cAs\ndifficult and winding as the path has been to the final accord, it\u2019s always the case that\nimplementation of an agreement is 10 times harder than the actual negotiation\u201d (Casey,\n2016),.\nOther groups on the list include Palestinian Resistance Groups. Most had their roots in\nthe 1970s and 1980s to oppose the state of Israel. They include the Abu Nidal\nOrganization and the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade. Some groups, such as HAMAS, could fit\ninto either the radical Islamic or Palestinian Resistance category.\nStill other groups represent resistance or liberation movements, like the Basque\nFatherland and Liberty and the Continuity Irish Republican Army. The final two\norganizations fit into the \u201creligious\u2013other\u201d category. They are the aforementioned Aum\nShinryko and a Jewish terrorist group, Kahane Chai.\nAlthough international groups tend to dominate the news, in terms of sheer numbers,\ndomestic extremists probably exceed their numbers, at least in the United States. A word\nof caution here\u2014it is not against the law to hate another race or be a member of an\nantigovernment organization. Indeed, both are protected under the Constitution.\nHowever, when extremism crosses over into criminal behavior, the authorities can and\nshould become involved. To that end, the movements described in the next few\nparagraphs are included here because, historically, they have produced individuals who\nhave engaged in illegal activities. This is not to say, however, that the movements\nthemselves are terroristic in nature.\nPerhaps the folks who immediately jump to mind when domestic terrorism is\nmentioned are white supremacists, such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Racial hatred has a\nlong history in the United States. Formed in the days of Reconstruction after the Civil\nWar, at one time the KKK claimed more than four million members. Most scholars agree\nthat the Klan has gone through three distinct phases. The first occurred immediately\nafter the end of the Civil War and included beatings, lynchings, and extreme violence.\nThe second occurred in the early twentieth century. The \u201cSecond Klan\u201d was much \nmore\npolitical and expanded its scope to include anti-Catholic, anti-Jewish, and anti-\nimmigrant philosophies. Finally, the third resurgence of the KKK came in the 1950s and\n1960s, during the Civil Rights Movement in the South. Like the first, this phase contained\nelements of extreme violence, such as the murder of three civil rights workers in\nMississippi in 1964 and the 1963 bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama, that\nkilled four young African-American girls.\nAlthough perhaps the best known, the KKK is not the only \nsupremacist group\n in the\n386\nUnited States. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks such organizations,\ncounted 892 active hate groups in the United States in 2015. This includes white\nsupremacist, black supremacist, neo-Nazi, and \u201cgeneral\u201d hate groups (Southern Poverty\nLaw Center, n.d.). Unfortunately, hate crimes are not just a sad remnant of the past. In\nAugust 2011, two white teenagers from an affluent Mississippi suburb allegedly drove to\nJackson, Mississippi to kill an African-American they selected at random. As they\nshouted \u201cwhite power,\u201d they beat and repeatedly ran over 49-year-old James Craig\nAnderson with their pick-up truck until he died (Griffin & Bronstein, 2011).\nThe \nantigovernment movement\n, which was termed the \u201cmilitia\u201d or \u201cpatriot\u201d\nmovement in the 1990s, is also showing signs of resurgence. Typically, adherents of the\npatriot philosophy believe the United States is in danger of being overtaken by an evil,\ninternational conspiracy; they often point to a speech then-President George H. W. Bush\nmade in 1991 in which he discussed the \u201cnew world order.\u201d They took that as\nconfirmation that a takeover was imminent. As a result, many individuals armed and\ntrained themselves, preparing to act as a defense force when the invasion ultimately\ncommenced. Occasionally, these activities were accompanied by bizarre and illegal\nfinancial activities, such as the nonpayment of income taxes and outright fraud\nmasquerading as political speech. In 1996, a heavily armed group calling itself the\nMontana Freemen engaged in a protracted standoff with FBI agents who arrived to\narrest them for numerous accounts of financial fraud. The Freemen were ultimately\narrested without incident. Such groups tend to proliferate in difficult financial times.\nThere is some indication that patriot-style movements are again gaining popularity. For\nexample, on May 10, 2010, Jerry R. Kane Jr., a self-styled \u201cdebt evader\u201d who held\nfreeman-type beliefs, and his 16-year-old son were stopped by West Memphis, Arkansas,\npolice officers. Without warning, the Kanes opened fire, killing two officers. They were\nsubsequently killed by other lawmen as they attempted to make their escape.\nThe most recent, and noteworthy, event involving the anti-government movement\nbegan in 2014 when rancher Clive Bundy refused to remove his cattle from federal lands\nin Nevada in defiance of a judge\u2019s order. The \nprotest continued in 2016 when Bundy\u2019s\ntwo sons, Ammon and Ryan, became engaged in a standoff with federal and state\nauthorities at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon. During the tense\nsituation, Oregon State Police shot and killed one of Bundy\u2019s supporters, Robert \u201cLaVoy\u201d\nFinicum, during a car stop. Eventually, all involved surrendered to authorities. On\nOctober 27, 2016, Ryan and Ammon Bundy and five of their followers were acquitted in\nfederal court of all charges relating to the Oregon takeover. As of this writing, federal\ncharges remain in place against the Bundys and several of their followers for the events\nin Nevada. After the Oregon trial, one of the defense attorneys in the Oregon case\nsummed up the sentiment that may have led to the acquittals: \u201cThe government was not\nhere to find the truth \u2026 This case is about people wanting to be heard, and they\u2019re just\nfrustrated with our government\u201d (Sherwood & Johnson, 2016)\nDomestic terrorists come from all different political persuasions, ranging from the far\nright to the far left. An example of the latter involves \neco-terrorists\n, who generally\n387\nbelong to one of two organizations: the Earth Liberation Movement (ELF) or the Animal\nLiberation Movement (ALF). As the name implies, ALF believes that all life, including\nanimal life, is sacred. As a result, its members engage in vandalism, sabotage, and theftto\nmake their point. ALF activities include breaking in to, and releasing animals from,\nanimal research laboratories and fur farms. Throughout their history, they have been\nresponsible for many millions of dollars in damage and the destruction of many years of\nimportant medical research.\nELF takes a somewhat broader view of things and sees itself as the protector of the\nearth as a whole; it tends to strike out at \u201cgreedy\u201d corporate interests and companies it\nsees as destroyers of the environment. One of ELF\u2019s tactics is arson\u2014in 1996, anonymous\nELF members claimed responsibility for burning a ski lodge in Vail, Colorado, to the\nground, causing $12 million in damages. They allegedly carried out this act to preserve a\nhabitat for lynx.\nBoth ELF and ALF are shadowy organizations\u2014one does not physically \u201cjoin,\u201d and\nthere is no hierarchy. Instead, individuals carry out acts and later claim that they did so\nto further the ALF/ELF agenda. This makes them very difficult to investigate and\nprosecute.\nThe final group of terrorists we consider are those who have a \u201csingle issue\u201d to\naddress. Perhaps the best-known \nsingle-issue terrorists\n are the radical antiabortionists,\nwho have murdered clinic workers and caused significant damage. One such individual\nwas Eric Rudolph, who carried out a campaign of bombings across the southern United\nStates in the 1990s. He ultimately killed two and injured more than 100; his targets\nincluded the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and an abortion clinic in Birmingham,\nAlabama, \nin which an off-duty police officer was killed. Rudolph was put on the FBI\u2019s\nMost Wanted list but managed to elude authorities for five years. He pleaded guilty to\nvarious crimes and was sentenced to three consecutive life terms in prison, where he\ncurrently resides (National Public Radio, 2005).\nFragile States and Rogue Nations\nA \nfragile state\n is one that is vulnerable to conflict or collapse. In general, it cannot\nenforce the rule of law, poverty and human suffering are widespread, and it often lacks\nsovereignty over its own territory. The Fund for Peace has established widely accepted\ncriteria for determining whether a country is or is becoming a fragile state; those states\nrated as being on \u201cvery high alert\u201d are listed in \nTable 14.2\n.\nFailed and failing states are problems both for themselves and for the international\ncommunity. Obviously, civilized nations have a difficult time standing idly by while\npeople suffer. Failed states often need intervention, whether to assist with natural\ndisasters or to intervene to stop war and genocide. Their people need constant attention\nlest starvation and other calamities decimate the population.\nFailing states also spawn other threats to the international order. Consider Somalia,\n388\nwhich tops the Fund for Peace\u2019s list. It has become a breeding ground for both terrorism\nand international piracy. Until and unless something is done to strengthen the\ngovernment, these problems will only worsen.\nTable 14.2\n \nFund for Peace\u2019s Fragile State Index, 2016\nSomalia\nSouth Sudan\nCentral African Republic\nSudan\nYemen\nSyria\nChad\nCongo\nSource:\n Fund for Peace. (n.d.) Fragile State Index, 2016. http://fsi.fundforpeace.org/rankings-2016.\nRogue states\n are somewhat different\u2014they are generally ruled by authoritarian\nregimes, sponsor terrorism, and seek to proliferate WMDs; for the most part, we define\nthem as states that are highly antagonistic toward the United States. Furthermore, the\ninstability and unquestioned power of their \nleaders makes it difficult to predict how they\nwill react in a given situation. For all intents and purposes, the states listed by the State\nDepartment as being sponsors of terror would also qualify as rogue states. There are one\nor two more that could also be added to the list, such as North Korea and Venezuela.\nAs should be obvious, the term \u201crogue state\u201d is loaded with pejorative context. What\nqualifies as a rogue state to the United States would likely not to others. For example,\nmost Middle Eastern governments would likely consider Israel to be a rogue state. To\nthat end, the term\u2019s usage is suspect.\n389\nConclusion\nThe threats now facing the United States are no longer monolithic, if they ever were.\nRather, they are broad and complex. America has chosen to fully engage on the world\nstage. As a result, it must be willing to accept the dangers that come from operating in a\ndangerous world. Since the end of the Cold War, the IC has sought to define its role in\nAmerican governance. As things currently stand, this means it must be willing to take\non a host of new responsibilities, including everything from natural disasters to WMDs.\nMany of these threats we see and understand; others have yet to emerge. It is critical that\nnational leaders remain vigilant to these emerging challenges and ensure that our nation\nand its resources are positioned to respond as needed. We discuss many possible\nemerging threats in \nChapter 15\n (\u201cFuture of Intelligence\u201d).\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nWhich of the threats identified in this chapter do you consider to be the most\nimportant? Why?\n2\n. \nIs the IC as currently organized equipped to handle many threats rather than\njust the one it faced during the Cold War?

Policymakers depend on the intelligence\ncommunity (IC) to help prepare them for future challenges and events. As such, the IC\nneeds constantly to look ahead, preparing itself for what might be.\nSince the publication of the first edition of this textbook in 2012, the world has\nchanged considerably. For example, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) had yet to\nemerge. Today, they claim credit for inspiring the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. In\naddition, Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Putin is attempting to reassert itself on\nthe world stage, while China is increasing its military presence in the South China Sea.\nIn this, the final chapter of the textbook, we will discuss the potential future of the\nintelligence enterprise.\nFor obvious reasons, the IC is very interested in the future. In order to successfully\nperform strategic or anticipatory intelligence, one must have the ability to creatively\nlook past the current horizon. This can be a difficult task\u2014after all, no one can predict\nthe future with absolute certainty. However, there are certain likely trends that will\nemerge over the course of the next several years. For example, it is difficult to imagine\nthat computers will not get smaller, cheaper, and faster. To that end, we can anticipate\nwith some degree of certainty that the \u201cInternet of Things\u201d will play a major role in\ntomorrow\u2019s world.\nThe IC has its own agency for looking toward the future and imagining how it will\naffect the interests of the United States and IC. The National Intelligence Council (NIC),\ncurrently led by Dr. Gregory Treverton, is the IC\u2019s futures \u201cthink tank.\u201d Reporting\ndirectly to the DNI, the NIC performs strategic forecasting at both the classified and\nunclassified levels. Perhaps its best-known product is the global futures publication that\nit puts out every few years. Drawing upon the expertise of analysts, academicians, and\nothers both inside and outside the IC, the \nGlobal Futures\n series\n has become a respected\nsource of information pertaining to possible and probable future events. The current\nedition of the global trends series titled \nAlternative Worlds\n (\nFigure 15.1\n), forecasts events\nout to the year 2030. See \nFigure 15.2\n for the NICs \u201cMegatrends\u201d; these are forces that the\nNIC believes will help define the future.\n397\nFigure 15.1\n Vice-President Joe Biden speaks before the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland in 2017.\nGlobalization and economic issues will continue to both benefit and challenge the United States well into the\n21st century. (Source: U.S. Embassy and Consulates in Brazil)\nFigure 15.2\n \nAs part of its Global Trends series, the National Intelligence Council describes the \u201cmegatrends\u201d it\nbelieves will have the greatest influence on changing the world between the present and the year 2030.\n398\nForecasting the Future\nThose who forecast rarely talk about \u201cthe\u201d future. This is because many potential futures\nexist. Predicting one in particular has, to date, proven difficult, if not impossible. Instead,\nfuturists (those who consider the future) talk about \nalternative futures\n that may or may\nnot occur. These are often termed:\nThe \nPossible\n: What \nmight\n occur.\nThe \nProbable\n: That which has a \nhigh likelihood\n of occurring.\nThe \nPreferable\n: The sort of future we would \nlike\n to have come about. When\nofficials make policy, they are generally attempting to \ncreate the preferred\nfuture\n.\nLikewise, analysts generally do not talk about \u201cprediction,\u201d which implies a level of\nspecificity and temporality that has proven elusive. This is not to say it will never be\nachieved. Sophisticated data mining techniques and reams of information made available\nthrough the internet have led experts to believe that accurate, automated, predictive\nsoftware may be possible. For example, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects\nActivity recently awarded contracts to develop:\n[C]ontinuous, automated analysis of publicly available data in order to anticipate and/or detect significant\nsocietal events, such as political crises, humanitarian crises, mass violence, riots, mass migrations, disease\noutbreaks, economic instability, resource shortages, and responses to natural disasters. (Intelligence Advanced\nResearch Projects Activity, 2011)\nThis is certainly an ambitious project; at this point, no one knows whether it will be\nsuccessful. Nevertheless, until something like this emerges, most analysts will continue\nto \u201cforecast\u201d rather than \u201cpredict.\u201d \nForecasting\n is a look forward to determining possible\nand probable futures. The \nGlobal Trends\n series described earlier is more properly termed\na forecast than a prediction.\nBlack Swan Events\nIn 2006, author Nicholas Taleb published the book \nBlack Swans\n, which had a major\nimpact on IC analysts. Basically, a black swan is a metaphor that refers to an improbable\nbut highly impactful event. Taleb wrote that in eighteenth century England, it was\nbelieved that all swans were white. However, when explorers first visited Australia, they\nfound black swans, which was highly unexpected. Indeed, it caused ornithologists to\nredefine what it meant to be a swan. Today, the IC expends a great deal of effort trying\nto define black swan events\u2014those that are difficult to anticipate but that would have a\nmajor \nimpact on the world. For example, experts consider the attacks of 9/11 a black\n399\nswan event. See \nFigure 15.3\n for a list of the NIC\u2019s black swan events leading to the year\n2030.\nFigure 15.3\n A \u201cBlack Swan\u201d is an unlikely event, but one that would have a signifi-cant impact if it occurred.\nThe IC must continually examine and consider Black Swans to avoid strategic surprise.\n400\nA Look Ahead\nTo gain some sense of the challenges the IC will face in the near future, we will examine\nsome \ndrivers\n, or external factors, that will likely have an effect on the world\u2019s future.\nThe four most often cited are:\nTechnology\nDemographics\nEconomics\nPolitics/Governance\nTechnology\nTechnology is important to understand, not only for its own sake but because it drives\nchange in other variables. For example, without the recent breakthroughs in social\nnetworking technology, political movements such as the Arab Spring would have been\nunthinkable.\nOne of the most significant facets of technology is the rate at which it changes\u2014\naccording to futurist Ray Kurzweil (2001):\nAn analysis of the history of technology shows that technological change is exponential, contrary to the\ncommon-sense \u2018intuitive linear\u2019 view. So we won\u2019t experience 100 years of progress in the 21st century\u2014it will\nbe more like 20,000 years of progress (at today\u2019s rate).\nNowhere is Kurzweil\u2019s observation more obvious than in the areas of computers and\ntheir associated technologies. In 1965, computer scientist Gordon Moore came up with a\nfamous forecast that has since become known as \nMoore\u2019s Law\n. He postulated that\ncomputing power doubles roughly every 18 months. According to researchers, this trend\nhas continued for almost 50 years and is not expected to change in the near future\n(Kanellos, 2005).\nIn the next 15 years or so, we can expect computers to become smaller, cheaper, and\nfaster. They will become part of everything we do, even more so than today. Part of this\nwill involve placing more objects on \u201cthe grid.\u201d In addition to computers, the\nimprovement of radio frequency identification (RFID) chips will help interconnect and\n\u201cwire\u201d the world. RFID chips are small devices that contain information and/or track\nmovements; they are cheap to manufacture and unobtrusive, making them easy to\nembed in an object. When scanned by an electronic device, they reveal information that\nin turn can be transmitted to computers.\nRFID chips today are already used to \u201cmark\u201d pets; the small devices are placed in the\nskin of animals with the owner\u2019s name and location stored as information. There is no\n401\nreason these same devices could not be placed in humans, allowing important\ninformation to be stored. A benevolent use of RFIDs could be the storage of medical\nhistories, with doctors immediately able to retrieve important information about a\npatient in the case of an emergency. A more sinister use could be the tracking of a\nsociety by a malevolent government.\nIndeed, compared to just a few years ago, the world seems to be highly wired. While\nthat is true, it does not begin to scratch the surface of where \nwe may be in just a few\nyears. Today, there are approximately 12,000,000,000 devices that are hooked into the\ninternet. These include computers, cameras, and supervisory control and data acquisition\n(SCADA) devices that control utilities. By the year 2020, the computer giant Cisco\nanticipates that there will be 50 billion such connections in the world (Evans, 2011); at\nthat point, we will be living in the \nInternet of Things\n, where many common devices\nwill be linked to the internet as well. In tomorrow\u2019s \u201csmart house,\u201d your television,\nrefrigerator, heating and cooling system, and just about everything else, will have an\ninternet connection. Experts say this will make our lives considerably better\u2014for\nexample, you will be able to control your thermostat remotely, heating or cooling your\nhouse to your desired temperature long before you get there.\nWhile this extreme level of connectivity will no doubt improve our quality of life, it\nconcerns many security professionals. In particular, the Internet of Things will provide\nmany more suitable targets for hackers and terrorists to exploit. Imagine someone\nhaving the ability to \u201chack\u201d into your household appliances, using them to mount an\nattack. In fact, according to the cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, that has already\nhappened:\n[In late 2013 and early 2014] hackers broke into more than 100,000 everyday consumer gadgets, such as home-\nnetworking routers, connected multi-media centers, televisions, and at least one refrigerator, Proofpoint says.\nThey then used those objects to send more than 750,000 malicious emails to enterprises and individuals\nworldwide. (Bort, 2014)\nThe evolution of computers will no doubt be a double-edged sword. On the one hand,\nthey have made lives much more comfortable and enhanced manufacturing, information\nsharing, communications, and even entertainment. In a very real way, the internet has\nlinked the world together as never before. On the other hand, we have grown dependent\non it in almost every facet of our lives; this dependence exposes us to extreme\nvulnerabilities. Suppose the internet were to \u201ccrash.\u201d The economic ramifications of this\nwould be catastrophic. In addition, many important systems are linked to the internet;\ncyber terrorists could wreak havoc on a grand scale with the push of a few buttons. In\n2011, computer security expert Gregory Wilshusen provided chilling testimony before\nthe U.S. Congress regarding just how vulnerable America\u2019s computer systems are to\nindividual and state-sponsored hacking (see \nBox 15.1\n).\nBox 15.1\n \nCongressional Testimony of Gregory C.\n402\nWilshusen Regarding Cyber Security\nPervasive and sustained cyberattacks against the United States continue to pose a\npotentially devastating impact on federal and nonfederal systems and operations. In\nFebruary 2011, the Director of National Intelligence testified that, in the past year,\nthere had been a dramatic increase in malicious cyber activity targeting U.S.\ncomputers and networks, including a more than tripling of the volume of malicious\nsoftware since 2009 \u2026 As computer technology has advanced, federal agencies and\nour nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014 such as power distribution, water supply,\ntelecommunications, and emergency services\u2014have become increasingly dependent\non computerized information systems to carry out their operations and to process,\nmaintain, and report essential information \u2026 the threats to information systems are\nevolving and growing, and systems supporting our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure\nand federal systems are not sufficiently protected to consistently thwart the threats.\nAdministration and executive branch agencies need to take actions to improve our\nnation\u2019s cyber security posture, including implementing the actions recommended\nby the President\u2019s cyber security policy review and enhancing cyber analysis and\nwarning capabilities. In addition, actions are needed to enhance security over\nfederal systems and information, including fully developing and effectively\nimplementing agency wide information security programs and implementing open\nrecommendations. Until these actions are taken, our nation\u2019s federal and nonfederal\ncyber critical infrastructure will remain vulnerable.\nSource:\n Wilshusen, G. C. (2011). Cybersecurity: Continued attention needed to\nprotect our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure and federal information systems.\nTestimony before the Committee on Homeland Security\u2019s Subcommittee on\nCybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies. Washington,\nDC: Government Accounting Office.\nUnited States Strategic Command. (n.d.) U.S. Cyber Command: Mission.\nwww.stratcom.mil/factsheets/Cyber_Command/.\nTo meet the growing challenges of defending cyberspace, the National Security\nAgency has made \u201cinformation assurance\u201d a major part of its mission. Moreover, in 2009,\nthe military established the United States Cyber Command, which is responsible for:\n[P]lanning, coordinating, integrating, synchronizing, and directing activities to operate and defend the\nDepartment of Defense information networks and when directed, conduct full-spectrum military cyberspace\noperations (in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations) in order to ensure U.S. and allied freedom of\naction in cyberspace, while denying the same to our adversaries. (United States Strategic Command, 2011)\nThis is a clear acknowledgment that the next war will be fought not just with guns,\n403\nairplanes, and bombs\u2014the battlefield will most certainly include cyber space as well.\nAt the extreme end of the technological spectrum are two \u201cwildcards\u201d that may well\ncause major changes whose ramifications are difficult to predict. The first is\nnanotechnology\n, which has to do with manipulating matter at the atomic and\nsubatomic levels. Imagine being able to manufacture things the way nature does\u2014from\nthe ground up. Microscopic cells divide and replicate and, before long, a flower or a\nhuman is formed. Many scientists believe that the same process can be employed to\nmanufacture and change objects. If developed to a mature level, nanomanufacturing\ncould revolutionize medicine, materials science, and just about every other process that\nmankind uses. Of course, there are potential downsides\u2014no one is sure what the\nenvironmental ramifications might entail. Furthermore, nanoweapons could be\ndevastating\u2014attacking people and armies at a level that would be impossible to defend\nagainst.\nThe second wildcard is \nartificial intelligence (AI)\n, a state in which computers learn\nto \u201cthink\u201d like humans. This includes the ability to understand and successfully\nmanipulate one\u2019s environment, reason, plan, and communicate meaningfully. Some\nscientists add self-awareness and sentience to the mix (the aforementioned Ray Kurzweil\nhas written a book titled \nThe Age of Spiritual Machines\n). Suppose computers develop the\nability to do all these things; already, they are much faster than humans at performing\nmathematical operations and retrieving information (consider the speed at which search\nengines operate). How long will it be before they develop superhuman thinking skills? A\nyear? A month? Minutes? And what happens next? In truth, no one really knows. This\npotential future event is considered so significant that science fiction writer Vernor\nVinge gave it a name: the \nTechnological Singularity\n. It is the point at which a new\ntechnology so powerful emerges that any future predictions as to its effects are\nmeaningless.\nAs readers might imagine, not everyone is comfortable with these possibilities. In\n2000, Bill Joy, then Chief Scientist for Sun Technologies, wrote an article for \nWired\nmagazine titled, \u201cWhy the Future Doesn\u2019t Need Us,\u201d in which he warned about the\ndangers posed by new technologies. Despite the ethical debate this article prompted,\ndevelopment in the aforementioned areas proceeds unabated.\nDemographics\nPrecise forecasts in areas such as nanotechnology and AI are difficult to make; it is\nsomewhat easier, however, to discern how populations will change in the future. A few\ntrends have been developing for some time, and it is unlikely they will change markedly.\nBy 2025, the world\u2019s population should reach eight billion; Africa and East Asia will\naccount for the majority of that growth with much less expected in the West. The\npopulations of some countries (China and India) are expected to explode, whereas others,\nsuch as Russia, Ukraine, Italy, almost all countries in Eastern Europe, and Japan, will see\n404\ntheir populations decline. Many people will reside in cities rather than in rural areas; the\ngrowing urbanization of the world will be one of the key demographic shifts of the early\ntwenty-first century (National Intelligence Council, 2008).\nIn part, this follows a historic trend: affluent countries, such as the United States, have\na lower birthrate than those that are struggling economically. The combination of a\nsurplus population and poor economic times is usually a predictor of migration: young\npeople in countries suffering \nyouth bulges\n are forced to look elsewhere for jobs. They\ngenerally end up in more affluent countries, which, given their lower birthrates, have\ninadequate labor pools. Consider the United States: in the past several years, many\ncitizens of Mexico have legally and illegally emigrated to the United States in the hope of\nfinding better jobs.\nAlthough most immigrants tend to be law-abiding, this is not always the case. For\nexample, the 9/11 hijackers, young men from Middle Eastern countries, formulated much\nof their plan to attack the United States while residing in Hamburg, Germany. Some\nhave concluded that feelings of isolation and detachment brought on by alienation from\na strange society helped fuel their feelings of outrage toward the West. According to the\nNIC, the future will likely produce conditions that are ripe for more 9/11s. As articulated\nin \nGlobal Trends 2025\n (2008: 22):\nThe current youth bulges in the Maghreb states, Turkey, Lebanon, and Iran will diminish rapidly but those in\nthe West Bank/Gaza, Iraq, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and adjacent Afghanistan and Pakistan will persist through\n2025. Unless employment conditions change dramatically, youth in weak states will continue to go elsewhere\u2014\nexternalizing volatility and violence.\nOne of the big concerns for U.S. intelligence agencies is the nature of the national\nborders, especially with Mexico. They have grown porous as a result of lucrative\nsmuggling opportunities for both humans and illicit goods. Many experts have voiced\nconcerns that terrorists could exploit both legal and illegal immigration to introduce\nthemselves and/or weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) into the United States.\nAnother demographic trend that will affect U.S. interests concerns older people. Two\nmajor events are occurring simultaneously: \nbaby boomers\n, that huge segment of the\npopulation born between 1946 and 1964, are entering their retirement years. At the same\ntime, people in developed nations are living longer and healthier. Taken together, the\nimplication is clear: the senior population in the United States will likely explode in the\nnext several years. Already, experts are worried about how the nation will support these\nindividuals; many retirement plans, including Social Security, appear unable to meet the\ngrowing demands of the senior population. The situation might grow dire enough that\nthe economic stability of the country could be threatened. Will the baby boomers be the\nstraw that breaks America\u2019s economic back? It is hard to say. A few futures-oriented\ncriminologists (including one of your authors) have some ideas what the future may hold\nin terms of demographics (see \nBox 15.2\n).\nEconomic Trends\n405\nIn terms of size, speed, and directional flow, the global shiftin relative wealth and economic power now under\nway\u2014roughly from West to East\u2014is without precedent in modern history. (National Intelligence Council, 2008:\nvi)\nBox 15.2\n \nAn Excerpt from the Future of Policing\nAs the population ages, there will be increased pressure to supplement the\nworkforce to replace and support retirees. Yet-to-be developed technologies may\nimprove manufacturing efficiency to a point, but experts suggest that immigrants\nmay make up an increasingly large portion of the United States population and\nlabor force. According to the Census Bureau, by the year 2030 Hispanics will make\nup 23.75%of the population, compared to 16.29%in 2010. Whites will account for\napproximately 54.53%, down from 64.39%in 2010. African-Americans will account\nfor approximately 12%of the population, roughly equivalent to 2010 figures. Asian-\nAmericans will account for 6.5%of the population, up from 4.67%today (U.S. Census\nBureau, 2009). Given the continuing \u201cyouth bulges\u201d and poor economies of places\nsuch as the West Bank/Gaza, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, one should\nnot discount the likelihood that citizens from these countries will find their way\ninto the United States.\nSource:\n Schafer, J. A. et al. (2011). The future of policing: A practical guide for\npolice managers and leaders, Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press.\nThere can be no doubt that the economies of nations today are intertwined as never\nbefore. The phenomenon of \nglobalization\n\u2014the linking together \nof economies and\ncultures\u2014has \u201cshrunk\u201d the world and made populations ever dependent on one another.\nToday, it is easier than ever to communicate across long distances with little or no cost,\nthanks to technological advances and the \u201cwiring\u201d of the world with fiber optic cable\nduring the 1990s. Additionally, trade barriers, such as taxes and tariffs on imported\ngoods, have increasingly disappeared. This has led to a global economy, where\ncompanies are free to locate wherever they want. As a result, global giants such as\nGeneral Motors, once thought of as an \u201cAmerican\u201d car company, now have plants in\nover 30 countries (General Motors, n.d.).\nGlobalization undoubtedly pays dividends\u2014the cheap prices one pays for goods\nmanufactured in China results from the inexpensive labor costs in that country. On the\nother hand, the linking together of economies also exposes them to certain levels of risk.\nEconomic difficulties in even a small country, such as Greece, sends shudders through\nfinancial markets around the globe.\nFour countries in particular appear to be emerging as global financial leaders\u2014Brazil,\nRussia, India, and China, known collectively as the \nBRICs\n. Each of these countries\nenjoys abundant resources and/or low labor costs, which experts predict will lead to\n406\neconomic dominance in the twenty-first century.\nAll of this remains speculative, however. As the financial collapse of 2008\ndemonstrated, economies are fragile and subject to variables that are difficult to forecast.\nOptimistically, the NIC believes that, in the first years of the twenty-first century, the\nnumber of individuals entering the \nglobal middle class\n will increase from 440 million to\n1.2 billion (National Intelligence Council, 2008). Insofar as middle classes lend stability to\na society, this could be a very good sign. However, wealth distribution worldwide is\nexpected to remain unequal; wealthy elites may emerge, but those countries that are\ndesperately poor will likely remain so.\nPolitics/Governance\nAs anyone who has followed the Arab Spring events in the Middle East realizes, the\nworld order is under siege. Social networking and virtual communities are allowing\npeople to communicate and organize in a way that would have been unthinkable even 20\nyears ago. Although the immediate implications of this are being played out on the\nstreets of Damascus and Cairo, the larger ramifications of the Information Age may be\nequally important in the long run. The underlying trend in all of this has to do with the\nnature of boundaries\u2014increasingly, electronic boundaries are supplanting physical \nones.\nIn other words, people now have the ability to organize and socialize with a wide range\nof individuals.\nSocial psychologists tell us that the people with whom we associate have a large\ninfluence on our lives. They reinforce our beliefs and help us form our own identities.\nFor many years, geographic boundaries determined our communities; hence, many\npeople defined themselves based on their physical location, say, as \u201cAmericans\u201d or \u201cNew\nYorkers.\u201d This is, of course, good for local and national identity\u2014it strengthens\ncommunity ties and reinforces loyalty to one\u2019s nation\u2013state. Today, people can\ncommunicate with others virtually\u2014their interests rather than their physical\ncommunities can determine their associates. Some experts believe this will strengthen\nties to groups other than governments, allowing people to explore their religion,\nethnicity, personal interests, etc., with others who have similar interests. Will this cause\na decrease in the power of nation\u2013states, even as it allows for increased cohesion within\nother types of groups? Some believe so. Where this will lead is uncertain. At the very\nleast, in the early days of the twenty-first century social networking has demonstrated\nthat it can bring people of like interests together, providing a means to share ideas and\norganize activities. Already we are seeing the effects that the internet is having on\n\u201cradicalizing\u201d individuals. \nBox 15.3\n describes the case of \u201cJihad Jane,\u201d a woman from\nsuburban Philadelphia who became an al Qa\u2019ida operative, entirely through online\nradicalization. Homegrown terrorists like this represent a huge challenge for the IC.\nThe \nblurring of boundaries\n is not limited to governments. Even within groups,\ntraditional definitions are fading away. For example, years ago it was easy to define the\n407\nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC): it was a Marxist insurgency founded\nin 1964 that was dedicated to the overthrow of the Colombian government. Today,\nalthough it still appears on the State Department\u2019s list of groups designated as terrorist\norganizations, it receives a tremendous amount of funding through the drug trade and\nkidnappings\u2014 so much so that it looks to many like a criminal cartel. Given FARCs\nrecent (2016) peace treaty with the Colombian government, it is expected to curtail both\nits terrorist and its criminal ambitions.\nPerhaps the most significant political trend to emerge over the course of the next 10\nyears will be the increase in power of certain states like the BRICs and the decrease of\nWestern global dominance. China, for example, has consistently increased its military\nfunding despite the global recession; it has also altered the types of weapons it purchases,\nfrom regional and tactical to global and strategic.\nHow the United States will react to these changes is difficult to ascertain. Already\nthere are signs that political discontent is on the rise\u2014the emergence\nBox 15.3\n \nFrom Files of the FBI: Story of \u201cJihad Jane\u201d\nPHILADELPHIA\u2014Colleen R. LaRose, aka \u201cJihad Jane,\u201d 47, pleaded guilty today to\nall counts of a superseding indictment charging her with conspiracy to provide\nmaterial support to terrorists, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, making false\nstatements, and attempted identity theft. LaRose faces a maximum potential\nsentence of life in prison and a $1 million fine when sentenced.\nLaRose, a U.S. citizen and former resident of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania,\nwas charged by indictment in March 2010. A superseding indictment was filed in\nApril 2010, adding co-defendant Jamie Paulin Ramirez, a U.S. citizen and former\nresident of Colorado. Ramirez is awaiting trial, which is scheduled to begin on May\n2, 2011.\nAccording to documents filed with the court, LaRose and her co-conspirators\nrecruited men on the internet to wage violent jihad in South Asia and Europe and\nrecruited women on the internet who had passports and the ability to travel to and\naround Europe in support of violent jihad.\nLaRose and her coconspirators used the internet to establish relationships with\none another and to communicate regarding their plans, which included martyring\nthemselves, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports, and avoiding travel\nrestrictions (through the collection of passports and through marriage) in order to\nwage violent jihad. LaRose also stole another individual\u2019s U.S. passport and\ntransferred it in an effort to facilitate an act of international terrorism.\nIn addition, LaRose received a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of\nSweden, and to do so in a way that would frighten \u201cthe whole Kufar [non-believer]\nworld.\u201d LaRose agreed to carry out her murder assignment, and she and her\ncoconspirators discussed that her appearance and American citizenship would help\n408\nher blend in while carrying out their plans. LaRose later traveled to Europe and\ntracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task.\n\u201cToday\u2019s guilty plea, by a woman from suburban America who plotted with\nothers to commit murder overseas and to provide material support to terrorists,\nunderscores the evolving nature of the threat we face,\u201d said David Kris, Assistant\nAttorney General for National Security. \u201cI applaud the many agents and analysts\nand prosecutors who helped bring about today\u2019s result.\u201d\nSource:\n Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Could the combination\nof economic malaise and political frustration lead to a national or even global reshifting\nof power? It is hard to say\u2014in the \npast, such upheavals often brought with them violence\nand lawlessness. The IC may find its hands full for quite some time.\n409\nFuture Threats and Challenges\nThe intelligence community will continue to face myriad threats and challenges as the\ntwenty-first century progresses. In this section, we highlight three: terrorism, the rise of\nRussia and China, and the challenge of encryption. At the end of the day, these may not\nprove to be the most significant or difficult to confront, but they do represent three\nseparate areas of interest: technology, non-state actors, and historical adversaries.\nThe Future of Terrorism\nAs we discussed in \nChapter 14\n, the dominant terrorist threat confronting the United\nStates in mid-2016 continues to come from radical Salafist groups, such as Al Qai\u2019da and\nISIS. However, domestic movements, such as the Sovereign Citizens, continue to grow in\ninfluence in the United States as well. In some important ways, the future would seem to\nfavor violent radical groups of all types. The continued improvement of technology\nallows small, non-state actors to act as only nation states could some years back. For\nexample, while Google Earth may seem mundane today, it represents a GEOINT\ncapability that only a few countries possessed 15 years ago. Terrorist groups have proven\nto be exceptionally adept at adapting technology for their own purposes\u2014 the\naforementioned Google Earth was used to devastating effect by terrorists in the 2008\nMumbai, India attacks in which 164 people were killed.\nAdditionally, the internet has proven to be an excellent platform for terrorists to\nspread their ideology, recruit members in place, communicate, and learn new skills.\nToday, many of the suspected terrorists arrested in the United States are believed to have\nbeen \u201cself-radicalized\u201d by individuals they have never met. For years, groups like the Ku\nKlux Klan and the Animal Liberation Front promoted the idea of \u201cleaderless resistance,\u201d\nwhere an individual receives indoctrination and inspiration to act from leaders who\nnever know their identity. The individual chooses the time and place to act and, if\nsuccessful, claims that he/she acted on behalf of a particular group. Prior to the internet,\nit was difficult for leaders to spread their message to large groups of people; today, that\nis obviously not the case. Most experts believe that the ability to communicate will only\nincrease in the future. While this will no doubt bring people together, it will also make\nthe job of the terrorist significantly easier.\nIntelligence and law enforcement officials are especially concerned about terrorists\nobtaining weapons of mass destruction, up to and including nuclear \ndevices. While this\napparently has not yet happened, some years ago there was great angst about Russian\nnuclear weapons and components being sold on the black market. In addition, the\ninternet provides ready-made instructions that anyone can download to construct\n410\nchemical and even biological weapons.\nIt is difficult to forecast which groups and movements will remain dominant in the\nfuture. When asked, most government officials will confirm that we are in a \u201clong war\u201d\nagainst terrorism. In today\u2019s world, significant portions of the Middle East and Africa\nremain destabilized, thus providing fertile recruiting ground for all types of terrorist\ngroups. In addition, while ISIS may currently be losing territory in Iraq, officials are\nworried about the new territory it is gaining in places like Libya and the Philippines.\nWhile territorial gains remain important for most groups, winning the hearts and minds\nof adherents, either directly or remotely, will largely determine which terrorist groups\nachieve success in the long run.\nIn a 2015 article, one of your authors described what he believed to be the\ncharacteristics of terrorism in the future; his forecasts appear in \nBox 15.4\n.\nRussia and China\nBox 15.4\n \nJensen\u2019s Potential Drivers of Terrorism Out to\nthe Year 2020\nRapidly evolving technology will offer benefits for both terrorist[s] \u2026 and\nthe authorities;\nIncreasing globalization and political upheaval will produce new and\ninteresting alliances;\nThe most successful terrorist movements will be those that \u2026 integrate\nhierarchical and networked structures;\n[It will be] \u2026 increasingly difficult to find meaningful differences between\ngangs, criminal enterprises \u2026 and terrorists.\nSource:\n Jensen, C. J. (2015). Potential drivers of terrorism out to the year 2020.\nAmerican Behavioral Scientist\n 59(13): 1698\u20131714, DOI: 10.1177/0002764215588819.\nBy the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was in a state of rapid disintegration. Soon, many of\nits satellite territories became independent and, by December 1991, the Russian Soviet\nFederative Socialist Republic had become the Russian Federation. There was a general\nsense of euphoria throughout the globe\u2014what had once been a world on the brink of\nnuclear annihilation now seemed to be poised to enter the twenty-first century with the\nspirit of mutual \ncooperation and trust. World leaders like President George H. W. Bush\nand UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher even proclaimed the existence of a \u201cpeace\ndividend,\u201d where a reduced need for defense spending would lead to greater prosperity\nfor all nations.\n411\nContemporaneous with this, China was becoming an economic juggernaut. As early\nas 1978, China had introduced agricultural reforms, which allowed for small capitalist\ncracks in its socialist model. In a 2015 paper, the National Bureau of Economic Research\ndiscussed China\u2019s shiftfrom a regional agricultural economy to a global industrial giant\nbetween the years 1953 and 2012. The authors credited market liberalization with\nallowing China to emerge as a major global exporter. In 1990, authorities re-opened the\nShanghai Stock Exchange, and in 2000, China joined the World Trade Organization\n(Cheremukhin, Golosov, Guriev, & Tsyvinski, 2015).\nBy the late 1990s, if the United States could not describe its relationship with Russia\nand China as exactly \u201cfriendly,\u201d at least the threat of direct military conflict seemed\nmuch reduced from the days of the Cold War. In addition, China and the United States\nhad become economically dependent upon one another, with China producing many of\nthe goods that Americans consumed.\nDespite this seeming shiftin relations, however, some things remained constant from\nthe Cold War. For example, the East and West continued to spy on one another. In 2001,\nFBI Special Agent Robert Hanssen was arrested in the process of making a \u201cdead drop\u201d\nto his Russian handlers and in 2010, the FBI rounded up 10 Russian \u201csleeper agents\u201d who\nhad been operating in the United States for at least a decade. In addition, even as\nmilitary tensions between the countries eased, each retained a nuclear arsenal in\ncontinuation of the Mutual Assured Destruction doctrine.\nBy 2016, Russia had begun to reassert itself militarily on the world stage. In 2014,\nRussian forces invaded Crimea, a territory inside Ukraine, which had been a state of the\nUSSR during the Cold War. The invasion sparked international anger, culminating in\nsanctions imposed by many powers, including the United States and the European\nUnion. In addition, the United States has accused Russia of engaging in intentionally\nprovocative encounters between its forces and American Navy vessels. For its part,\nRussia claims that it has acted only in self-defense, protecting its own territories and\ninterests.\nSome experts believe that Russian leader Vladimir Putin is using international events\nto divert attention from Russian domestic issues that include a sluggish economy\nweakened by low oil prices. According to RAND Corporation analysts William Courtney\nand Donald Jensen:\nRussian elites wrongly tend to see the international system as driven mainly by foreign leaders\u2019 cynicism and\naggrandizement, which the Kremlin can \nmanipulate or buy. They misunderstand how values such as liberty\nthrive in the West, and the role of voluntary structures such as the European Union and NATO. The Kremlin\ntries to buttress popular support by inventing external enemies, adding to its foreign policy challenges.\n(Courtney & Jensen, 2016)\nLike Russia, China has stepped up its military activities. In a 2016 report, the Pentagon\nhighlighted two main objectives for the Chinese military in the next several years: 1)\nPromote its maritime activities, especially in the South China Sea; and 2) Increase its\nmilitary presence internationally (Office of the Secretary of Defense, 2016).\nTo achieve its first goal, China has increased development of its naval and coast guard\n412\nforces, which in turn have become much more assertive in the South China Sea. In\naddition, it has engaged in some highly creative and somewhat questionable activities,\nsuch as constructing artificial islands on reefs located in international waters. Once\nconstructed, China has declared these islands to be part of its sovereign territory; in\nsome cases, it has established military facilities there, such as airfields.\nIt appears that China is not merely content to maintain a presence in the South China\nSea; more recently, it has shown signs of improving its \u201cblue water\u201d capability. For\nexample, on September 25, 2012, China commissioned its first aircraftcarrier, the\nLiaoning\n. Historically, aircraftcarriers have proven highly effective in projecting a\nnation\u2019s power far from its own shores. This increased military capability comes at a\ntime when China is also attempting to protect as well as increase its economic reach\ninternationally. Consider the case of rare earth metals, which are essential in the\nmanufacture of such things as superconductors and cancer drugs. For years, China has\ndominated the rare earth market; by some estimates, it currently controls 90% of the\nworld\u2019s market share. However, newly discovered rare earth deposits in Africa as well as\na decreasing reserve of these same elements in China threaten this dominance over the\nnext several years. To address these issues, China has made aggressive moves to\npurchase mining rights in Africa. However, countries like the United States and\nconfederations like the European Union hope to halt China\u2019s virtual monopoly.\nLike many nations with international ambitions, China hopes to expand economically\nwhile maintaining the ability to protect its economic interests through military power.\nTo that end, economic and military considerations are not distinct but go hand-in-hand.\nThe military resurgence of Russia and China reflect the cyclical nature of\ninternational politics. Indeed, even as politicians in the 1990s talked \nabout peace\ndividends, the IC kept its eye on these two powerful nations. The ability to prevent\nstrategic surprise requires constant vigilance. While it is difficult to predict what may lie\nahead, it is virtually certain that both Russia and China will remain foci of the\nintelligence world for many years to come.\nEncryption\nThe vulnerability of internet-based systems and communications devices discussed\nearlier in this chapter has sparked a huge debate in the United States. On the one hand, it\nwould seem self-evident that a society would want computers to communicate with one\nanother in the most secure way possible. Software giants such as Apple and\nMicrosoftwork diligently to develop strong encryption systems and procedures to reduce\nthe vulnerability of their systems. However, encryption can be a double-edged sword.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence agencies depend heavily on SIGINT, the lawful\ninterception of communications. Consider, for example, the NSA, whose primary\nmission involves intercepting overseas communications. If encryption becomes too\npowerful, law enforcement and the IC claim they will lose the ability to monitor\n413\nelectronic communications, thereby putting American lives at risk from terrorists and\ncriminals.\nThe issue came to a head following the San Bernardino terrorist attack of 2015.\nFollowing the shootings, which claimed the lives of 14 victims, law enforcement\nauthorities discovered a cellular telephone that was used by one of the shooters as a\nwork telephone. Because this particular type of phone locked after 10 failed password\nattempts, the FBI approached Apple and asked them to create software that would allow\nauthorities to override security features; Apple declined. Federal authorities attempted to\nuse a 1789 law, the All Writs Act, to justify why Apple should be compelled to comply\nwith their request. By 2016, the matter had made its way into federal district court, with\nthe FBI strongly arguing that public safety mandated that law enforcement authorities\nshould have the right to bypass encryption through a \u201cback door\u201d that companies would\nbe required to construct. Apple and other communications companies and service\nproviders not surprisingly rejected the Bureau\u2019s arguments. FBI Director James Comey\nbecame an out-spoken advocate for providing law enforcement access to encrypted\ndevices. Remarks he made in response to the issue are found in \nBox 15.5\n. Apple\u2019s\nresponse is found in \nBox 15.6\n.\nIn the end, the FBI paid a third-party to hack into the terrorist\u2019s phone, avoiding a\ncourt battle. However, the legal issue behind encryption remains \nunsettled and will likely\ncontinue to be vigorously debated into the future. On the one hand, installing a \u201cback\ndoor\u201d into any system increases the likelihood that individuals, both allies and\nadversaries, will be able to access the system along with law enforcement and\nintelligence officials. Critics argue this will make everyone less safe and secure. On the\nother hand, SIGINT has provided the basis for much good intelligence as well as\npowerful evidence to convict criminals and terrorists; losing the ability to legally exploit\ncommunications will undoubtedly make the job of law enforcement and intelligence\nagencies that much more difficult.\nBox 15.5\n \nStatement of FBI Director James Comey,\nFebruary 21, 2016\nThe San Bernardino litigation isn\u2019t about trying to set a precedent or send any kind\nof message. It is about the victims and justice. Fourteen people were slaughtered\nand many more had their lives and bodies ruined. We owe them a thorough and\nprofessional investigation under law. That\u2019s what this is. The American people\nshould expect nothing less from the FBI. The particular legal issue is actually quite\nnarrow. The relief we seek is limited and its value increasingly obsolete because the\ntechnology continues to evolve. We simply want the chance, with a search warrant,\nto try to guess the terrorist\u2019s passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing\nand without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t want to break\nanyone\u2019s encryption or set a master key loose on the land. I hope thoughtful people\n414\nwill take the time to understand that. Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding\nmore terrorists. Maybe it doesn\u2019t. But we can\u2019t look the survivors in the eye, or\nourselves in the mirror, if we don\u2019t follow this lead \u2026 Although this case is about\nthe innocents attacked in San Bernardino, it does highlight that we have awesome\nnew technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure\u2014\nprivacy and safety. That tension should not be resolved by corporations that sell\nstuff for a living. It also should not be resolved by the FBI, which investigates for a\nliving. It should be resolved by the American people deciding how we want to\ngovern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\nSource:\n FBI. (2016, February 21).

However, some experts say that new\ngenerations of supercomputers, such as those owned by the NSA, will be able to\neventually crack even this \u201cunbreakable\u201d encryption.\nBox 15.6\n \nStatement of Apple CEO Tim Cox, February\n16, 2016\nThe United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented\nstep which threatens the security of our customers.

The most recent addition to the series, published\nin 2017, is titled \nParadox of Progress.\n As the title suggests, the DNI believes:\nThe achievements of the industrial and information ages are shaping a world to come that is both more\ndangerous and richer with opportunity than ever before. Whether promise or peril prevails will turn on the\nchoices of human-kind. (Director of National Intelligence, 2017)\nThe 2008 edition in the series, \nVision 2015\n, provides a list of \nPersistent Threats and\nEmerging Missions\n that the DNI believes the IC will face in the 21st century. These\ninclude (Director of National Intelligence, 2008: 5):\nFailed States\nSpace\nFinancial\nClimate Change\nRogue States\nEnergy and Natural resources\nRising Powers\nInsurgencies\nTerrorism\nCrime\nWeapons of Mass Destruction\nCyber\nDrugs\nCounterintelligence\nThe first thing that should jump out at readers is the sheer number of threats and\nmissions: 14. In addition, the document was written before the 2009 influenza pandemic;\nwere it written today, pandemics would likely be added to the list. This stands in sharp\ncontrast to the IC of the Cold War, when the major threat could be boiled down to one\u2014\nworldwide Communism. Additionally, the breadth of the threats is astonishing. The\ninclusion of terrorism, insurgencies, and counterintelligence should surprise no one. But\nenergy and natural resources? Climate change? Financial markets? Clearly, the DNI\nbelieves that national security is much broader than war fighting and politics\u2014to be\ntruly secure, a nation must meet the many often thorny and intractable challenges it\nfaces. Economic security means little if the climate is ravaged beyond repair. This sets\nout enormous challenges to the IC, which has been accustomed to addressing only a few\n417\nproblems at a time.\nThe strategies the DNI plans to use to achieve the ambitious goals of creating a\n\u201cglobally networked and integrated intelligence enterprise\u201d include:\nIntegrat[ing] foreign, military, and domestic intelligence capabilities through policy, personnel and technology\nactions to provide decision advantage to policy makers, warfighters (sic), homeland security officials and law\nenforcement personnel. (Director of National Intelligence, 2008: i)\nThis will be no easy task. Bringing together 16 separate agencies that span the cultural\nand professional divide from military to intelligence to law enforcement \nwill in and of\nitself prove quite challenging. In reading the DNI\u2019s vision in its entirety, certain themes\nemerge. He wants to create an enterprise that is \nintegrated\n, that is, one where agencies\nwork and talk easily and freely with one another, within the restrictions of the law and\nsecurity. He wants an IC that is \nagile\n, able to shiftswiftly and seamlessly between\nimportant tasks. Furthermore, he wants it to be \nforward looking and aligned\n with the\nchallenges of the future. To that end, part of \nVision 2015\n discusses the phenomenon\nknown as the \ntyranny of the immediate\n, where agencies and individuals tend to focus\non the pressing problems of the moment and neglect other less visible challenges that\nmay spring up. For example, in 2004, certain Federal Bureau of Investigation officials\nwarned of the impending mortgage crisis that helped bring about the recession of 2008;\ntheir requests for additional agents to work white-collar crime matters went unheeded\nbecause the \u201cimmediate\u201d problem facing the United States was judged by the powers-\nthat-be at the time to be terrorism.\nThe DNI has laid out three areas that will prove critical to implementing his strategy:\npolicy, technology, and personnel. We examine each in the following subsections.\nInfrastructure and Technology\nThe IC must have computer and information technology systems that are up to the\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Currently, many agencies lack these capabilities.\nPart of the problem has been the federal acquisition process. To guard against fraud and\nabuse, it is intentionally deliberative, with long lead times built in. This means that it\ntakes a significant amount of time for the federal government to buy expensive items.\nUsually, many companies can bid on a contract before it is awarded. Despite the benefits\nthis can bring, it is ill-suited for dealing with technologies that change at lightning speed.\nBy the time an agency finally purchases and installs equipment, it may already be\noutdated.\nPart of the solution may rest with the private sector, which has to follow few of the\nrules that the government does. In addition, much of the expertise with regard to\ntechnological systems resides in private companies and firms and in universities. It\nseems highly likely that new, innovative partnerships between the public and private\nsectors will have to emerge.\n418\nPolicy\nPerhaps the greatest challenges facing the IC reside in the policy arena. One of the most\npersistent areas of dysfunction concerns the unwillingness or inability to collaborate.\nPart of this is policy driven: the nature of security \nand the \u201cneed to know\u201d mentality that\naccompanies it discourages information sharing. One area that the DNI has pledged to\naddress is security\u2014how can information be shared with those who need it while\nkeeping it out of the hands of those who would do us harm? This is no simple task.\nAlthough the solution has yet to be realized, the IC is making strides in implementing\nnew procedures designed to encourage proper sharing. Part of the solution may reside in\nthe nature of information itself. Thanks to the internet, more and more useful data are\nmaking their way into the public arena\u2014it is no longer true that for information to have\nvalue, it must have been obtained from a classified source. In a nod to this, in 2005 the\nDNI opened the Open Source Center, a part of the IC that collects information from\npublicly available sources, such as the internet, radio, television, video, and commercial\ndatabases. Much important intelligence has already come from this collection of data.\nFurthermore, the DNI has begun to address the serious issue of \u201cover classification,\u201d\nwhere agencies routinely classify information at higher levels than is proper. This is a\nsafe position for an organization\u2014by being extra careful, one does not have to worry\nabout sensitive information becoming public. However, it also serves to keep important\nintelligence out of the hands of those who need it.\nFinally, most agree that the procedures agencies use to grant security clearances need\na complete overhaul. Each agency has its own requirements for granting clearances. To\nobtain a top secret clearance in one organization, a person may have to undergo a\npolygraph; in another, they may not, despite the fact that their clearance in one agency\nwill allow access to the others. This makes little sense. In addition, clearances take an\nextraordinary amount of time to complete and they can be quite costly. Some of the\nrequirements make little sense to critics\u2014for example, time spent in a foreign country is\ncrucial in understanding languages and cultures; however, for some agencies, this makes\nit difficult to obtain a clearance. Agencies may be turning away exactly the sort of\npeople they most need.\nThe biggest impediment that the DNI identified with regard to sharing is cultural\u2014for\na host of bureaucratic and other reasons, many find it difficult to collaborate. This is a\nmindset that needs to change.\nThe DNI also must look at the structure of itself and agencies to ensure that they are\noptimally aligned with the realities of the Information Age. Many organizations have\nshifted to a \nnet centric\n approach, which is guided by networks and information.\nIndividuals and organizations react flexibly and nimbly to challenges that are presented.\nThe IC is still organized along the lines of hierarchies, with well-defined and rigid\nchains-of-command. This organizational arrangement is not suited for flexibility\u2014it is\nslow and promotes the \nstatus quo\n; it is the antithesis of agility.\n419\nPersonnel\nThe final challenge for the IC, and possibly the most important, concerns personnel. An\nagency is only as good as the people it hires. As the 14 challenges and threats described\nabove make clear, the IC will have to hire a wide range of personnel to accomplish its\nambitious goals\u2014scientists, medical doctors, computer programmers, historians, speakers\nof critical languages, administrators, accountants, social scientists\u2014there is no\nprofessional or educational background that is not in some way currently suited to the\nIC. Some of the more critical areas for hire include cyber and critical languages (e.g.,\nArabic, Chinese); however, people without these skills should not be deterred.\nOnce hired, the IC is going to have to do a better job of ensuring lifelong education for\nits people. A recurrent theme in this chapter has been the ubiquity and speed of future\nchange; IC professionals need to be constantly learning in order to make sense of the\nworld around them.\nFinally, the IC will have to learn to maximize the skills of a generation reared on\nvideo games, instant communication, uncertainty, and continual change; these are the\nrealities of the world that exist today and the ones that will continue into the foreseeable\nfuture.\n420\nConclusion\nThe attacks of 9/11 proved to be a rude awakening for the IC; they showed definitively\nthat the days of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d were over. Bad as they were, they may have forced\nthe intelligence world to take a good, hard look at itself to prepare for the challenges of\nthe future. If this is the case, perhaps something positive came out of the horrible\ntragedy.\nIn the days following the attacks, the intelligence agencies of the U.S. government\ntook a decidedly proactive stance toward the challenges of the future; this is most\nassuredly a good thing. The IC is in a constant state of flux; few predict that this will\nchange anytime soon. To protect America, IC agencies need to be collaborative, agile,\nflexible, and forward thinking. Whether they will be able to achieve these lofty goals is\nan open question. However, given what is at stake, we can only hope the answer will be\n\u201cyes.\u201d\nQuestions for Discussion\n1\n. \nFuturists talk about \u201ccreating the preferred future.\u201d Do you think that is\npossible, especially on a large scale? Is it something the IC should be\nattempting to do? Why or why not?\n2\n. \nThe DNI identified 14 emerging threats and challenges. Did he leave any offthe\nlist? What else do you think will emerge as a threat that the IC will have to\nconfront in the next 10 years? Why?\n3\n. \nOf the four drivers of the future that were highlighted in this chapter\n(technology, demographics, economics, politics/governance), which do you\nthink will have the greatest effect on the future? Why?\n4\n. \nIf you were the DNI, what would you do to better prepare the IC for dealing\nwith future threats and challenges?\n5\n. \nHow will the Internet of Things affect the IC?\n421\nKey Terms\nAlternative Futures\nArtificial intelligence (AI)\nBaby boomers\nBRICs\nBlack Swan Events\nBlurring of boundaries\nCreate the preferred future\nDNI\u2019s Persistent Threats and Emerging Missions\nForecasting\nGlobal Futures series\nYouth bulges\nGlobalization\nInternet of Things\nGlobal middle class\nMoore\u2019s Law\nNanotechnology\nNet centric\nPossible future\nPreferable\nProbable future\nTechnological Singularity\nTyranny of the immediate\n422\nReferences\nBort, J.

We present a new method that views object detection as a\ndirect set prediction problem. Our approach streamlines the detection\npipeline, e\u000bectively removing the need for many hand-designed compo-\nnents like a non-maximum suppression procedure or anchor generation\nthat explicitly encode our prior knowledge about the task. The main\ningredients of the new framework, called DEtection TRansformer or\nDETR, are a set-based global loss that forces unique predictions via bi-\npartite matching, and a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Given\na \fxed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the re-\nlations of the objects and the global image context to directly output\nthe \fnal set of predictions in parallel. The new model is conceptually\nsimple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other\nmodern detectors. DETR demonstrates accuracy and run-time perfor-\nmance on par with the well-established and highly-optimized Faster R-\nCNN baseline on the challenging COCO object detection dataset. More-\nover, DETR can be easily generalized to produce panoptic segmentation\nin a uni\fed manner. We show that it signi\fcantly outperforms com-\npetitive baselines. Training code and pretrained models are available at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/detr .\n1 Introduction\nThe goal of object detection is to predict a set of bounding boxes and category\nlabels for each object of interest. Modern detectors address this set prediction\ntask in an indirect way, by de\fning surrogate regression and classi\fcation prob-\nlems on a large set of proposals [37,5], anchors [23], or window centers [53,46].\nTheir performances are signi\fcantly in\ruenced by postprocessing steps to col-\nlapse near-duplicate predictions, by the design of the anchor sets and by the\nheuristics that assign target boxes to anchors [52]. To simplify these pipelines,\nwe propose a direct set prediction approach to bypass the surrogate tasks. This\nend-to-end philosophy has led to signi\fcant advances in complex structured pre-\ndiction tasks such as machine translation or speech recognition, but not yet in\nobject detection: previous attempts [43,16,4,39] either add other forms of prior\nknowledge, or have not proven to be competitive with strong baselines on chal-\nlenging benchmarks. This paper aims to bridge this gap.\n?Equal contributionarXiv:2005.12872v3  [cs.CV]  28 May 2020\n2 Carion et al.\ntransformer encoder-decoderCNNset of box predictionsbipartite matching lossno object (\u00f8)no object (\u00f8)set of image features\nFig. 1: DETR directly predicts (in parallel) the \fnal set of detections by combining\na common CNN with a transformer architecture. During training, bipartite matching\nuniquely assigns predictions with ground truth boxes. Prediction with no match should\nyield a \\ no object \" (?) class prediction.\nWe streamline the training pipeline by viewing object detection as a direct set\nprediction problem. We adopt an encoder-decoder architecture based on trans-\nformers [47], a popular architecture for sequence prediction. The self-attention\nmechanisms of transformers, which explicitly model all pairwise interactions be-\ntween elements in a sequence, make these architectures particularly suitable for\nspeci\fc constraints of set prediction such as removing duplicate predictions.\nOur DEtection TRansformer (DETR, see Figure 1) predicts all objects at\nonce, and is trained end-to-end with a set loss function which performs bipar-\ntite matching between predicted and ground-truth objects. DETR simpli\fes the\ndetection pipeline by dropping multiple hand-designed components that encode\nprior knowledge, like spatial anchors or non-maximal suppression. Unlike most\nexisting detection methods, DETR doesn't require any customized layers, and\nthus can be reproduced easily in any framework that contains standard CNN\nand transformer classes.1.\nCompared to most previous work on direct set prediction, the main features of\nDETR are the conjunction of the bipartite matching loss and transformers with\n(non-autoregressive) parallel decoding [29,12,10,8]. In contrast, previous work\nfocused on autoregressive decoding with RNNs [43,41,30,36,42]. Our matching\nloss function uniquely assigns a prediction to a ground truth object, and is\ninvariant to a permutation of predicted objects, so we can emit them in parallel.\nWe evaluate DETR on one of the most popular object detection datasets,\nCOCO [24], against a very competitive Faster R-CNN baseline [37]. Faster R-\nCNN has undergone many design iterations and its performance was greatly\nimproved since the original publication. Our experiments show that our new\nmodel achieves comparable performances. More precisely, DETR demonstrates\nsigni\fcantly better performance on large objects, a result likely enabled by the\nnon-local computations of the transformer. It obtains, however, lower perfor-\nmances on small objects. We expect that future work will improve this aspect\nin the same way the development of FPN [22] did for Faster R-CNN.\nTraining settings for DETR di\u000ber from standard object detectors in mul-\ntiple ways. The new model requires extra-long training schedule and bene\fts\n1In our work we use standard implementations of Transformers [47] and ResNet [15]\nbackbones from standard deep learning libraries.\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 3\nfrom auxiliary decoding losses in the transformer. We thoroughly explore what\ncomponents are crucial for the demonstrated performance.\nThe design ethos of DETR easily extend to more complex tasks. In our\nexperiments, we show that a simple segmentation head trained on top of a pre-\ntrained DETR outperfoms competitive baselines on Panoptic Segmentation [19],\na challenging pixel-level recognition task that has recently gained popularity.\n2 Related work\nOur work build on prior work in several domains: bipartite matching losses for\nset prediction, encoder-decoder architectures based on the transformer, parallel\ndecoding, and object detection methods.\n2.1 Set Prediction\nThere is no canonical deep learning model to directly predict sets. The basic set\nprediction task is multilabel classi\fcation (see e.g., [40,33] for references in the\ncontext of computer vision) for which the baseline approach, one-vs-rest, does\nnot apply to problems such as detection where there is an underlying structure\nbetween elements (i.e., near-identical boxes). The \frst di\u000eculty in these tasks\nis to avoid near-duplicates. Most current detectors use postprocessings such as\nnon-maximal suppression to address this issue, but direct set prediction are\npostprocessing-free. They need global inference schemes that model interactions\nbetween all predicted elements to avoid redundancy. For constant-size set pre-\ndiction, dense fully connected networks [9] are su\u000ecient but costly. A general\napproach is to use auto-regressive sequence models such as recurrent neural net-\nworks [48]. In all cases, the loss function should be invariant by a permutation of\nthe predictions. The usual solution is to design a loss based on the Hungarian al-\ngorithm [20], to \fnd a bipartite matching between ground-truth and prediction.\nThis enforces permutation-invariance, and guarantees that each target element\nhas a unique match. We follow the bipartite matching loss approach. In contrast\nto most prior work however, we step away from autoregressive models and use\ntransformers with parallel decoding, which we describe below.\n2.2 Transformers and Parallel Decoding\nTransformers were introduced by Vaswani et al. [47] as a new attention-based\nbuilding block for machine translation. Attention mechanisms [2] are neural net-\nwork layers that aggregate information from the entire input sequence. Trans-\nformers introduced self-attention layers, which, similarly to Non-Local Neural\nNetworks [49], scan through each element of a sequence and update it by ag-\ngregating information from the whole sequence. One of the main advantages of\nattention-based models is their global computations and perfect memory, which\nmakes them more suitable than RNNs on long sequences. Transformers are now\n4 Carion et al.\nreplacing RNNs in many problems in natural language processing, speech pro-\ncessing and computer vision [8,27,45,34,31].\nTransformers were \frst used in auto-regressive models, following early sequence-\nto-sequence models [44], generating output tokens one by one. However, the pro-\nhibitive inference cost (proportional to output length, and hard to batch) lead\nto the development of parallel sequence generation, in the domains of audio [29],\nmachine translation [12,10], word representation learning [8], and more recently\nspeech recognition [6]. We also combine transformers and parallel decoding for\ntheir suitable trade-o\u000b between computational cost and the ability to perform\nthe global computations required for set prediction.\n2.3 Object detection\nMost modern object detection methods make predictions relative to some ini-\ntial guesses. Two-stage detectors [37,5] predict boxes w.r.t. proposals, whereas\nsingle-stage methods make predictions w.r.t. anchors [23] or a grid of possible\nobject centers [53,46]. Recent work [52] demonstrate that the \fnal performance\nof these systems heavily depends on the exact way these initial guesses are set.\nIn our model we are able to remove this hand-crafted process and streamline the\ndetection process by directly predicting the set of detections with absolute box\nprediction w.r.t. the input image rather than an anchor.\nSet-based loss. Several object detectors [9,25,35] used the bipartite matching\nloss. However, in these early deep learning models, the relation between di\u000berent\nprediction was modeled with convolutional or fully-connected layers only and a\nhand-designed NMS post-processing can improve their performance. More recent\ndetectors [37,23,53] use non-unique assignment rules between ground truth and\npredictions together with an NMS.\nLearnable NMS methods [16,4] and relation networks [17] explicitly model\nrelations between di\u000berent predictions with attention. Using direct set losses,\nthey do not require any post-processing steps. However, these methods employ\nadditional hand-crafted context features like proposal box coordinates to model\nrelations between detections e\u000eciently, while we look for solutions that reduce\nthe prior knowledge encoded in the model.\nRecurrent detectors. Closest to our approach are end-to-end set predictions\nfor object detection [43] and instance segmentation [41,30,36,42]. Similarly to us,\nthey use bipartite-matching losses with encoder-decoder architectures based on\nCNN activations to directly produce a set of bounding boxes. These approaches,\nhowever, were only evaluated on small datasets and not against modern baselines.\nIn particular, they are based on autoregressive models (more precisely RNNs),\nso they do not leverage the recent transformers with parallel decoding.\n3 The DETR model\nTwo ingredients are essential for direct set predictions in detection: (1) a set\nprediction loss that forces unique matching between predicted and ground truth\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 5\nboxes; (2) an architecture that predicts (in a single pass) a set of objects and\nmodels their relation. We describe our architecture in detail in Figure 2.\n3.1 Object detection set prediction loss\nDETR infers a \fxed-size set of Npredictions, in a single pass through the\ndecoder, where Nis set to be signi\fcantly larger than the typical number of\nobjects in an image. One of the main di\u000eculties of training is to score predicted\nobjects (class, position, size) with respect to the ground truth. Our loss produces\nan optimal bipartite matching between predicted and ground truth objects, and\nthen optimize object-speci\fc (bounding box) losses.\nLet us denote by ythe ground truth set of objects, and ^ y=f^yigN\ni=1the\nset ofNpredictions. Assuming Nis larger than the number of objects in the\nimage, we consider yalso as a set of size Npadded with ?(no object). To \fnd\na bipartite matching between these two sets we search for a permutation of N\nelements\u001b2SNwith the lowest cost:\n^\u001b= arg min\n\u001b2SNNX\niLmatch (yi;^y\u001b(i)); (1)\nwhereLmatch (yi;^y\u001b(i)) is a pair-wise matching cost between ground truth yiand\na prediction with index \u001b(i). This optimal assignment is computed e\u000eciently\nwith the Hungarian algorithm, following prior work ( e.g. [43]).\nThe matching cost takes into account both the class prediction and the sim-\nilarity of predicted and ground truth boxes. Each element iof the ground truth\nset can be seen as a yi= (ci;bi) whereciis the target class label (which\nmay be ?) andbi2[0;1]4is a vector that de\fnes ground truth box cen-\nter coordinates and its height and width relative to the image size. For the\nprediction with index \u001b(i) we de\fne probability of class cias ^p\u001b(i)(ci) and\nthe predicted box as ^b\u001b(i). With these notations we de\fne Lmatch (yi;^y\u001b(i)) as\n\u00001fci6=?g^p\u001b(i)(ci) +1fci6=?gLbox(bi;^b\u001b(i)).\nThis procedure of \fnding matching plays the same role as the heuristic assign-\nment rules used to match proposal [37] or anchors [22] to ground truth objects\nin modern detectors. The main di\u000berence is that we need to \fnd one-to-one\nmatching for direct set prediction without duplicates.\nThe second step is to compute the loss function, the Hungarian loss for all\npairs matched in the previous step. We de\fne the loss similarly to the losses of\ncommon object detectors, i.e. a linear combination of a negative log-likelihood\nfor class prediction and a box loss de\fned later:\nLHungarian (y;^y) =NX\ni=1h\n\u0000log ^p^\u001b(i)(ci) +1fci6=?gLbox(bi;^b^\u001b(i))i\n; (2)\nwhere ^\u001bis the optimal assignment computed in the \frst step (1). In practice, we\ndown-weight the log-probability term when ci=?by a factor 10 to account for\n6 Carion et al.\nclass imbalance. This is analogous to how Faster R-CNN training procedure bal-\nances positive/negative proposals by subsampling [37]. Notice that the matching\ncost between an object and ?doesn't depend on the prediction, which means\nthat in that case the cost is a constant. In the matching cost we use probabil-\nities ^p^\u001b(i)(ci) instead of log-probabilities. This makes the class prediction term\ncommensurable to Lbox(\u0001;\u0001) (described below), and we observed better empirical\nperformances.\nBounding box loss. The second part of the matching cost and the Hungarian\nloss isLbox(\u0001) that scores the bounding boxes. Unlike many detectors that do box\npredictions as a \u0001w.r.t. some initial guesses, we make box predictions directly.\nWhile such approach simplify the implementation it poses an issue with relative\nscaling of the loss. The most commonly-used `1loss will have di\u000berent scales for\nsmall and large boxes even if their relative errors are similar. To mitigate this\nissue we use a linear combination of the `1loss and the generalized IoU loss [38]\nLiou(\u0001;\u0001) that is scale-invariant. Overall, our box loss is Lbox(bi;^b\u001b(i)) de\fned as\n\u0015iouLiou(bi;^b\u001b(i)) +\u0015L1jjbi\u0000^b\u001b(i)jj1where\u0015iou;\u0015L12Rare hyperparameters.\nThese two losses are normalized by the number of objects inside the batch.\n3.2 DETR architecture\nThe overall DETR architecture is surprisingly simple and depicted in Figure 2. It\ncontains three main components, which we describe below: a CNN backbone to\nextract a compact feature representation, an encoder-decoder transformer, and\na simple feed forward network (FFN) that makes the \fnal detection prediction.\nUnlike many modern detectors, DETR can be implemented in any deep learn-\ning framework that provides a common CNN backbone and a transformer archi-\ntecture implementation with just a few hundred lines. Inference code for DETR\ncan be implemented in less than 50 lines in PyTorch [32]. We hope that the sim-\nplicity of our method will attract new researchers to the detection community.\nBackbone. Starting from the initial image ximg2R3\u0002H0\u0002W0(with 3 color\nchannels2), a conventional CNN backbone generates a lower-resolution activation\nmapf2RC\u0002H\u0002W. Typical values we use are C= 2048 and H;W =H0\n32;W0\n32.\nTransformer encoder. First, a 1x1 convolution reduces the channel dimension\nof the high-level activation map ffromCto a smaller dimension d. creating a\nnew feature map z02Rd\u0002H\u0002W. The encoder expects a sequence as input, hence\nwe collapse the spatial dimensions of z0into one dimension, resulting in a d\u0002HW\nfeature map. Each encoder layer has a standard architecture and consists of a\nmulti-head self-attention module and a feed forward network (FFN). Since the\ntransformer architecture is permutation-invariant, we supplement it with \fxed\npositional encodings [31,3] that are added to the input of each attention layer. We\ndefer to the supplementary material the detailed de\fnition of the architecture,\nwhich follows the one described in [47].\n2The input images are batched together, applying 0-padding adequately to ensure\nthey all have the same dimensions ( H0;W0) as the largest image of the batch.\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 7\nCNNset of image featurestransformer encoder\u2026\u2026\npositional encoding+transformer decoderclass,boxclass,boxno objectno objectFFNFFNFFNFFNobject queriesbackboneencoderdecoderprediction heads\nFig. 2: DETR uses a conventional CNN backbone to learn a 2D representation of an\ninput image. The model \rattens it and supplements it with a positional encoding before\npassing it into a transformer encoder. A transformer decoder then takes as input a\nsmall \fxed number of learned positional embeddings, which we call object queries , and\nadditionally attends to the encoder output. We pass each output embedding of the\ndecoder to a shared feed forward network (FFN) that predicts either a detection (class\nand bounding box) or a \\ no object \" class.\nTransformer decoder. The decoder follows the standard architecture of the\ntransformer, transforming Nembeddings of size dusing multi-headed self- and\nencoder-decoder attention mechanisms. The di\u000berence with the original trans-\nformer is that our model decodes the Nobjects in parallel at each decoder layer,\nwhile Vaswani et al. [47] use an autoregressive model that predicts the output\nsequence one element at a time. We refer the reader unfamiliar with the concepts\nto the supplementary material. Since the decoder is also permutation-invariant,\ntheNinput embeddings must be di\u000berent to produce di\u000berent results. These in-\nput embeddings are learnt positional encodings that we refer to as object queries ,\nand similarly to the encoder, we add them to the input of each attention layer.\nTheNobject queries are transformed into an output embedding by the decoder.\nThey are then independently decoded into box coordinates and class labels by\na feed forward network (described in the next subsection), resulting N\fnal\npredictions. Using self- and encoder-decoder attention over these embeddings,\nthe model globally reasons about all objects together using pair-wise relations\nbetween them, while being able to use the whole image as context.\nPrediction feed-forward networks (FFNs). The \fnal prediction is com-\nputed by a 3-layer perceptron with ReLU activation function and hidden dimen-\nsiond, and a linear projection layer. The FFN predicts the normalized center\ncoordinates, height and width of the box w.r.t. the input image, and the lin-\near layer predicts the class label using a softmax function. Since we predict a\n\fxed-size set of Nbounding boxes, where Nis usually much larger than the\nactual number of objects of interest in an image, an additional special class la-\nbel?is used to represent that no object is detected within a slot. This class\nplays a similar role to the \\background\" class in the standard object detection\napproaches.\nAuxiliary decoding losses. We found helpful to use auxiliary losses [1] in\ndecoder during training, especially to help the model output the correct number\n8 Carion et al.\nof objects of each class. We add prediction FFNs and Hungarian loss after each\ndecoder layer. All predictions FFNs share their parameters. We use an additional\nshared layer-norm to normalize the input to the prediction FFNs from di\u000berent\ndecoder layers.\n4 Experiments\nWe show that DETR achieves competitive results compared to Faster R-CNN\nin quantitative evaluation on COCO. Then, we provide a detailed ablation\nstudy of the architecture and loss, with insights and qualitative results. Fi-\nnally, to show that DETR is a versatile and extensible model, we present results\non panoptic segmentation, training only a small extension on a \fxed DETR\nmodel. We provide code and pretrained models to reproduce our experiments at\nhttps://github.com/facebookresearch/detr .\nDataset. We perform experiments on COCO 2017 detection and panoptic seg-\nmentation datasets [24,18], containing 118k training images and 5k validation\nimages. Each image is annotated with bounding boxes and panoptic segmenta-\ntion. There are 7 instances per image on average, up to 63 instances in a single\nimage in training set, ranging from small to large on the same images. If not\nspeci\fed, we report AP as bbox AP, the integral metric over multiple thresholds.\nFor comparison with Faster R-CNN we report validation AP at the last training\nepoch, for ablations we report median over validation results from the last 10\nepochs.\nTechnical details. We train DETR with AdamW [26] setting the initial trans-\nformer's learning rate to 10\u00004, the backbone's to 10\u00005, and weight decay to 10\u00004.\nAll transformer weights are initialized with Xavier init [11], and the backbone\nis with ImageNet-pretrained ResNet model [15] from torchvision with frozen\nbatchnorm layers. We report results with two di\u000berent backbones: a ResNet-\n50 and a ResNet-101. The corresponding models are called respectively DETR\nand DETR-R101. Following [21], we also increase the feature resolution by\nadding a dilation to the last stage of the backbone and removing a stride from\nthe \frst convolution of this stage. The corresponding models are called respec-\ntively DETR-DC5 and DETR-DC5-R101 (dilated C5 stage). This modi\fcation\nincreases the resolution by a factor of two, thus improving performance for small\nobjects, at the cost of a 16x higher cost in the self-attentions of the encoder,\nleading to an overall 2x increase in computational cost. A full comparison of\nFLOPs of these models and Faster R-CNN is given in Table 1.\nWe use scale augmentation, resizing the input images such that the shortest\nside is at least 480 and at most 800 pixels while the longest at most 1333 [50].\nTo help learning global relationships through the self-attention of the encoder,\nwe also apply random crop augmentations during training, improving the per-\nformance by approximately 1 AP. Speci\fcally, a train image is cropped with\nprobability 0.5 to a random rectangular patch which is then resized again to\n800-1333. The transformer is trained with default dropout of 0.1.

To optimize for AP, we override the predic-\ntion of these slots with the second highest scoring class, using the corresponding\ncon\fdence. This improves AP by 2 points compared to \fltering out empty slots.\nOther training hyperparameters can be found in section A.4. For our ablation\nexperiments we use training schedule of 300 epochs with a learning rate drop\nby a factor of 10 after 200 epochs, where a single epoch is a pass over all train-\ning images once. Training the baseline model for 300 epochs on 16 V100 GPUs\ntakes 3 days, with 4 images per GPU (hence a total batch size of 64). For the\nlonger schedule used to compare with Faster R-CNN we train for 500 epochs\nwith learning rate drop after 400 epochs. This schedule adds 1.5 AP compared\nto the shorter schedule.\n4.1 Comparison with Faster R-CNN\nTransformers are typically trained with Adam or Adagrad optimizers with very\nlong training schedules and dropout, and this is true for DETR as well. Faster\nR-CNN, however, is trained with SGD with minimal data augmentation and\nwe are not aware of successful applications of Adam or dropout. Despite these\ndi\u000berences we attempt to make a Faster R-CNN baseline stronger. To align it\nwith DETR, we add generalized IoU [38] to the box loss, the same random\ncrop augmentation and long training known to improve results [13]. Results\nare presented in Table 1. In the top section we show Faster R-CNN results\nfrom Detectron2 Model Zoo [50] for models trained with the 3xschedule. In the\nmiddle section we show results (with a \\+\") for the same models but trained\n10 Carion et al.\nTable 2: E\u000bect of encoder size.

In the last section of Table 1 we show the results for multiple\nDETR models. To be comparable in the number of parameters we choose a\nmodel with 6 transformer and 6 decoder layers of width 256 with 8 attention\nheads. Like Faster R-CNN with FPN this model has 41.3M parameters, out of\nwhich 23.5M are in ResNet-50, and 17.8M are in the transformer. Even though\nboth Faster R-CNN and DETR are still likely to further improve with longer\ntraining, we can conclude that DETR can be competitive with Faster R-CNN\nwith the same number of parameters, achieving 42 AP on the COCO val subset.\nThe way DETR achieves this is by improving AP L(+7.8), however note that the\nmodel is still lagging behind in AP S(-5.5). DETR-DC5 with the same number\nof parameters and similar FLOP count has higher AP, but is still signi\fcantly\nbehind in AP Stoo. Faster R-CNN and DETR with ResNet-101 backbone show\ncomparable results as well.\n4.2 Ablations\nAttention mechanisms in the transformer decoder are the key components which\nmodel relations between feature representations of di\u000berent detections. In our\nablation analysis, we explore how other components of our architecture and loss\nin\ruence the \fnal performance. For the study we choose ResNet-50-based DETR\nmodel with 6 encoder, 6 decoder layers and width 256. The model has 41.3M\nparameters, achieves 40.6 and 42.0 AP on short and long schedules respectively,\nand runs at 28 FPS, similarly to Faster R-CNN-FPN with the same backbone.\nNumber of encoder layers. We evaluate the importance of global image-\nlevel self-attention by changing the number of encoder layers (Table 2). Without\nencoder layers, overall AP drops by 3.9 points, with a more signi\fcant drop of\n6.0 AP on large objects. We hypothesize that, by using global scene reasoning,\nthe encoder is important for disentangling objects. In Figure 3, we visualize the\nattention maps of the last encoder layer of a trained model, focusing on a few\npoints in the image. The encoder seems to separate instances already, which\nlikely simpli\fes object extraction and localization for the decoder.\nNumber of decoder layers. We apply auxiliary losses after each decoding\nlayer (see Section 3.2), hence, the prediction FFNs are trained by design to pre-\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 11\nself-attention(430, 600)\nself-attention(520, 450)\nself-attention(450, 830)\nself-attention(440, 1200)\nFig. 3: Encoder self-attention for a set of reference points. The encoder is able to sep-\narate individual instances. Predictions are made with baseline DETR model on a vali-\ndation set image.\ndict objects out of the outputs of every decoder layer. We analyze the importance\nof each decoder layer by evaluating the objects that would be predicted at each\nstage of the decoding (Fig. 4). Both AP and AP 50improve after every layer,\ntotalling into a very signi\fcant +8.2/9.5 AP improvement between the \frst and\nthe last layer. With its set-based loss, DETR does not need NMS by design. To\nverify this we run a standard NMS procedure with default parameters [50] for\nthe outputs after each decoder. NMS improves performance for the predictions\nfrom the \frst decoder. This can be explained by the fact that a single decoding\nlayer of the transformer is not able to compute any cross-correlations between\nthe output elements, and thus it is prone to making multiple predictions for the\nsame object. In the second and subsequent layers, the self-attention mechanism\nover the activations allows the model to inhibit duplicate predictions. We ob-\nserve that the improvement brought by NMS diminishes as depth increases. At\nthe last layers, we observe a small loss in AP as NMS incorrectly removes true\npositive predictions.\nSimilarly to visualizing encoder attention, we visualize decoder attentions in\nFig. 6, coloring attention maps for each predicted object in di\u000berent colors. We\nobserve that decoder attention is fairly local, meaning that it mostly attends to\nobject extremities such as heads or legs. We hypothesise that after the encoder\nhas separated instances via global attention, the decoder only needs to attend\nto the extremities to extract the class and object boundaries.\nImportance of FFN. FFN inside tranformers can be seen as 1 \u00021 convo-\nlutional layers, making encoder similar to attention augmented convolutional\nnetworks [3]. We attempt to remove it completely leaving only attention in the\ntransformer layers. By reducing the number of network parameters from 41.3M\nto 28.7M, leaving only 10.8M in the transformer, performance drops by 2.3 AP,\nwe thus conclude that FFN are important for achieving good results.\nImportance of positional encodings. There are two kinds of positional en-\ncodings in our model: spatial positional encodings and output positional encod-\n12 Carion et al.\n1 2 3 4 5 63436384042\ndecoder layerAP\nAP No NMS\nAP NMS=0.7\n1 2 3 4 5 65456586062\ndecoder layer\nAP50\nAP No NMS\nAP NMS=0.7\nAP50No NMS\nAP50NMS=0.7\nFig. 4: AP and AP 50performance after each de-\ncoder layer. A single long schedule baseline model\nis evaluated. DETR does not need NMS by de-\nsign, which is validated by this \fgure. NMS lowers\nAP in the \fnal layers, removing TP predictions,\nbut improves AP in the \frst decoder layers, re-\nmoving double predictions, as there is no commu-\nnication in the \frst layer, and slightly improves\nAP50.\nFig. 5: Out of distribution gen-\neralization for rare classes.\nEven though no image in the\ntraining set has more than 13\ngira\u000bes, DETR has no di\u000e-\nculty generalizing to 24 and\nmore instances of the same\nclass.\nings (object queries). We experiment with various combinations of \fxed and\nlearned encodings, results can be found in table 3. Output positional encodings\nare required and cannot be removed, so we experiment with either passing them\nonce at decoder input or adding to queries at every decoder attention layer. In\nthe \frst experiment we completely remove spatial positional encodings and pass\noutput positional encodings at input and, interestingly, the model still achieves\nmore than 32 AP, losing 7.8 AP to the baseline. Then, we pass \fxed sine spatial\npositional encodings and the output encodings at input once, as in the original\ntransformer [47], and \fnd that this leads to 1.4 AP drop compared to passing\nthe positional encodings directly in attention. Learned spatial encodings passed\nto the attentions give similar results. Surprisingly, we \fnd that not passing any\nspatial encodings in the encoder only leads to a minor AP drop of 1.3 AP. When\nwe pass the encodings to the attentions, they are shared across all layers, and\nthe output encodings (object queries) are always learned.\nGiven these ablations, we conclude that transformer components: the global\nself-attention in encoder, FFN, multiple decoder layers, and positional encodings,\nall signi\fcantly contribute to the \fnal object detection performance.\nLoss ablations. To evaluate the importance of di\u000berent components of the\nmatching cost and the loss, we train several models turning them on and o\u000b.\nThere are three components to the loss: classi\fcation loss, `1bounding box\ndistance loss, and GIoU [38] loss. The classi\fcation loss is essential for training\nand cannot be turned o\u000b, so we train a model without bounding box distance\nloss, and a model without the GIoU loss, and compare with baseline, trained with\nall three losses. Results are presented in table 4.

DETR learns di\u000berent\nspecialization for each query slot. We observe that each slot has several modes of\noperation focusing on di\u000berent areas and box sizes. In particular, all slots have\nthe mode for predicting image-wide boxes (visible as the red dots aligned in the\nmiddle of the plot). We hypothesize that this is related to the distribution of\nobjects in COCO.\nGeneralization to unseen numbers of instances. Some classes in COCO\nare not well represented with many instances of the same class in the same\nimage. For example, there is no image with more than 13 gira\u000bes in the training\nset. We create a synthetic image3to verify the generalization ability of DETR\n(see Figure 5). Our model is able to \fnd all 24 gira\u000bes on the image which\nis clearly out of distribution. This experiment con\frms that there is no strong\nclass-specialization in each object query.\n4.4 DETR for panoptic segmentation\nPanoptic segmentation [19] has recently attracted a lot of attention from the\ncomputer vision community. Similarly to the extension of Faster R-CNN [37] to\nMask R-CNN [14], DETR can be naturally extended by adding a mask head on\ntop of the decoder outputs. In this section we demonstrate that such a head can\nbe used to produce panoptic segmentation [19] by treating stu\u000b and thing classes\n3Base picture credit: https://www.piqsels.com/en/public-domain-photo-jzlwu\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 15\nMulti head attention Input image \n(3 x H x W) \nBox embeddings \n(d x N) Encoded image \n(d x H/32 x W/32) \nAttention maps \n(N x M x H/32 x W/32) Masks logits \n(N x H/4 x W/4) Pixel-wise argmax \nConcatenate 2 x (Conv 3x3 + GN + ReLU) 2x up + add Conv 3x3 + GN + ReLU 2x up + add Conv 3x3 + GN + ReLU 2x up + add Conv 3x3 + GN + ReLU + Conv 3x3 \nFPN-style CNN Resnet features \nRes5 Res4 Res3 Res2 \nFig. 8: Illustration of the panoptic head. A binary mask is generated in parallel for each\ndetected object, then the masks are merged using pixel-wise argmax.\nFig. 9: Qualitative results for panoptic segmentation generated by DETR-R101. DETR\nproduces aligned mask predictions in a uni\fed manner for things and stu\u000b.\nin a uni\fed way. We perform our experiments on the panoptic annotations of the\nCOCO dataset that has 53 stu\u000b categories in addition to 80 things categories.\nWe train DETR to predict boxes around both stu\u000b and things classes on\nCOCO, using the same recipe. Predicting boxes is required for the training to\nbe possible, since the Hungarian matching is computed using distances between\nboxes. We also add a mask head which predicts a binary mask for each of the\npredicted boxes, see Figure 8. It takes as input the output of transformer decoder\nfor each object and computes multi-head (with Mheads) attention scores of this\nembedding over the output of the encoder, generating Mattention heatmaps\nper object in a small resolution. To make the \fnal prediction and increase the\nresolution, an FPN-like architecture is used. We describe the architecture in\nmore details in the supplement. The \fnal resolution of the masks has stride 4\nand each mask is supervised independently using the DICE/F-1 loss [28] and\nFocal loss [23].\nThe mask head can be trained either jointly, or in a two steps process, where\nwe train DETR for boxes only, then freeze all the weights and train only the mask\nhead for 25 epochs. Experimentally, these two approaches give similar results, we\nreport results using the latter method since it results in a shorter total wall-clock\ntime training.\n16 Carion et al.\nTable 5: Comparison with the state-of-the-art methods UPSNet [51] and Panoptic\nFPN [18] on the COCO valdataset We retrained PanopticFPN with the same data-\naugmentation as DETR, on a 18x schedule for fair comparison. UPSNet uses the 1x\nschedule, UPSNet-M is the version with multiscale test-time augmentations.\nModel Backbone PQ SQ RQ PQthSQthRQthPQstSQstRQstAP\nPanopticFPN++ R50 42.4 79.3 51.6 49.2 82.4 58.8 32.3 74.8 40.6 37.7\nUPSnet R50 42.5 78.0 52.5 48.6 79.4 59.6 33.4 75.9 41.7 34.3\nUPSnet-M R50 43.0 79.1 52.8 48.9 79.7 59.7 34.1 78.2 42.3 34.3\nPanopticFPN++ R101 44.1 79.5 53.3 51.0 83.2 60.6 33.6 74.0 42.1 39.7\nDETR R50 43.4 79.3 53.8 48.2 79.8 59.5 36.3 78.5 45.3 31.1\nDETR-DC5 R50 44.6 79.8 55.0 49.4 80.5 60.6 37.3 78.7 46.5 31.9\nDETR-R101 R101 45.1 79.9 55.5 50.5 80.9 61.7 37.0 78.5 46.0 33.0\nTo predict the \fnal panoptic segmentation we simply use an argmax over\nthe mask scores at each pixel, and assign the corresponding categories to the\nresulting masks. This procedure guarantees that the \fnal masks have no overlaps\nand, therefore, DETR does not require a heuristic [19] that is often used to align\ndi\u000berent masks.\nTraining details. We train DETR, DETR-DC5 and DETR-R101 models fol-\nlowing the recipe for bounding box detection to predict boxes around stu\u000b and\nthings classes in COCO dataset. The new mask head is trained for 25 epochs\n(see supplementary for details). During inference we \frst \flter out the detection\nwith a con\fdence below 85%, then compute the per-pixel argmax to determine\nin which mask each pixel belongs. We then collapse di\u000berent mask predictions\nof the same stu\u000b category in one, and \flter the empty ones (less than 4 pixels).\nMain results. Qualitative results are shown in Figure 9. In table 5 we compare\nour uni\fed panoptic segmenation approach with several established methods\nthat treat things and stu\u000b di\u000berently. We report the Panoptic Quality (PQ) and\nthe break-down on things (PQth) and stu\u000b (PQst). We also report the mask\nAP (computed on the things classes), before any panoptic post-treatment (in\nour case, before taking the pixel-wise argmax). We show that DETR outper-\nforms published results on COCO-val 2017, as well as our strong PanopticFPN\nbaseline (trained with same data-augmentation as DETR, for fair comparison).\nThe result break-down shows that DETR is especially dominant on stu\u000b classes,\nand we hypothesize that the global reasoning allowed by the encoder attention\nis the key element to this result. For things class, despite a severe de\fcit of\nup to 8 mAP compared to the baselines on the mask AP computation, DETR\nobtains competitive PQth. We also evaluated our method on the test set of the\nCOCO dataset, and obtained 46 PQ. We hope that our approach will inspire the\nexploration of fully uni\fed models for panoptic segmentation in future work.\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 17\n5 Conclusion\nWe presented DETR, a new design for object detection systems based on trans-\nformers and bipartite matching loss for direct set prediction. The approach\nachieves comparable results to an optimized Faster R-CNN baseline on the chal-\nlenging COCO dataset. DETR is straightforward to implement and has a \rexible\narchitecture that is easily extensible to panoptic segmentation, with competitive\nresults. In addition, it achieves signi\fcantly better performance on large objects\nthan Faster R-CNN, likely thanks to the processing of global information per-\nformed by the self-attention.\nThis new design for detectors also comes with new challenges, in particular\nregarding training, optimization and performances on small objects. Current\ndetectors required several years of improvements to cope with similar issues,\nand we expect future work to successfully address them for DETR.\n6 Acknowledgements\nWe thank Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Piotr Bojanowski, Natalia Neverova, David\nLopez-Paz, Guillaume Lample, Danielle Rothermel, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick,\nXinlei Chen and the whole Facebook AI Research Paris team for discussions and\nadvices without which this work would not be possible.\nReferences\n1.

The attention\nmechanism follows [47], except for the details of positional encodings (see Equa-\ntion 8) that follows [7].\nMulti-head The general form of multi-head attention withMheads of dimen-\nsiondis a function with the following signature (using d0=d\nM, and giving\nmatrix/tensors sizes in underbrace)\nmh-attn :Xq|{z}\nd\u0002Nq; X kv|{z}\nd\u0002Nkv; T|{z}\nM\u00023\u0002d0\u0002d; L|{z}\nd\u0002d7!~Xq|{z}\nd\u0002Nq(3)\nwhereXqis the query sequence of lengthNq,Xkvis the key-value sequence of\nlengthNkv(with the same number of channels dfor simplicity of exposition), T\nis the weight tensor to compute the so-called query, key and value embeddings,\nandLis a projection matrix. The output is the same size as the query sequence.\nTo \fx the vocabulary before giving details, multi-head self-attention (mh-s-attn)\nis the special case Xq=Xkv, i.e.\nmh-s-attn(X;T;L ) = mh-attn( X;X;T;L ): (4)\nThe multi-head attention is simply the concatenation of Msingle attention\nheads followed by a projection with L. The common practice [47] is to use residual\nconnections, dropout and layer normalization. In other words, denoting ~Xq=\nmh-attn(Xq;Xkv;T;L ) and\u0016\u0016X(q)the concatenation of attention heads, we have\nX0\nq= [attn(Xq;Xkv;T1);:::; attn(Xq;Xkv;TM)] (5)\n~Xq= layernorm\u0000\nXq+ dropout(LX0\nq)\u0001\n; (6)\nwhere [;] denotes concatenation on the channel axis.\nSingle head An attention head with weight tensor T02R3\u0002d0\u0002d, denoted by\nattn(Xq;Xkv;T0), depends on additional positional encoding Pq2Rd\u0002Nqand\nPkv2Rd\u0002Nkv. It starts by computing so-called query, key and value embeddings\nafter adding the query and key positional encodings [7]:\n[Q;K;V] = [T0\n1(Xq+Pq);T0\n2(Xkv+Pkv);T0\n3Xkv] (7)\nwhereT0is the concatenation of T0\n1;T0\n2;T0\n3. The attention weights \u000bare then\ncomputed based on the softmax of dot products between queries and keys, so\nthat each element of the query sequence attends to all elements of the key-value\nsequence (iis a query index and ja key-value index):\n\u000bi;j=e1p\nd0QT\niKj\nZiwhereZi=NkvX\nj=1e1p\nd0QT\niKj: (8)\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 21\nIn our case, the positional encodings may be learnt or \fxed, but are shared\nacross all attention layers for a given query/key-value sequence, so we do not\nexplicitly write them as parameters of the attention. We give more details on\ntheir exact value when describing the encoder and the decoder. The \fnal output\nis the aggregation of values weighted by attention weights: The i-th row is given\nby attni(Xq;Xkv;T0) =PNkv\nj=1\u000bi;jVj.\nFeed-forward network (FFN) layers The original transformer alternates\nmulti-head attention and so-called FFN layers [47], which are e\u000bectively multi-\nlayer 1x1 convolutions, which have Mdinput and output channels in our case.\nThe FFN we consider is composed of two-layers of 1x1 convolutions with ReLU\nactivations. There is also a residual connection/dropout/layernorm after the two\nlayers, similarly to equation 6.\nA.2 Losses\nFor completeness, we present in detail the losses used in our approach. All losses\nare normalized by the number of objects inside the batch. Extra care must be\ntaken for distributed training: since each GPU receives a sub-batch, it is not\nsu\u000ecient to normalize by the number of objects in the local batch, since in\ngeneral the sub-batches are not balanced across GPUs. Instead, it is important\nto normalize by the total number of objects in all sub-batches.\nBox loss Similarly to [41,36], we use a soft version of Intersection over Union\nin our loss, together with a `1loss on ^b:\nLbox(b\u001b(i);^bi) =\u0015iouLiou(b\u001b(i);^bi) +\u0015L1jjb\u001b(i)\u0000^bijj1; (9)\nwhere\u0015iou;\u0015L12Rare hyperparameters and Liou(\u0001) is the generalized IoU [38]:\nLiou(b\u001b(i);^bi) = 1\u0000\u0012jb\u001b(i)\\^bij\njb\u001b(i)[^bij\u0000jB(b\u001b(i);^bi)nb\u001b(i)[^bij\njB(b\u001b(i);^bi)j\u0013\n: (10)\nj:jmeans \\area\", and the union and intersection of box coordinates are used\nas shorthands for the boxes themselves. The areas of unions or intersections\nare computed by min =max of the linear functions of b\u001b(i)and^bi, which makes\nthe loss su\u000eciently well-behaved for stochastic gradients. B(b\u001b(i);^bi) means the\nlargest box containing b\u001b(i);^bi(the areas involving Bare also computed based\non min=max of linear functions of the box coordinates).\nDICE/F-1 loss [28] The DICE coe\u000ecient is closely related to the Intersection\nover Union. If we denote by ^ mthe raw mask logits prediction of the model, and\nmthe binary target mask, the loss is de\fned as:\nLDICE(m;^m) = 1\u00002m\u001b( ^m) + 1\n\u001b( ^m) +m+ 1(11)\nwhere\u001bis the sigmoid function. This loss is normalized by the number of objects.\n22 Carion et al.\nA.3 Detailed architecture\nThe detailed description of the transformer used in DETR, with positional en-\ncodings passed at every attention layer, is given in Fig. 10. Image features from\nthe CNN backbone are passed through the transformer encoder, together with\nspatial positional encoding that are added to queries and keys at every multi-\nhead self-attention layer. Then, the decoder receives queries (initially set to zero),\noutput positional encoding (object queries), and encoder memory, and produces\nthe \fnal set of predicted class labels and bounding boxes through multiple multi-\nhead self-attention and decoder-encoder attention. The \frst self-attention layer\nin the \frst decoder layer can be skipped.\nAdd & Norm\nFFN\nAdd & Norm\nMulti-Head Self-Attention\n/plus.osf /plus.osfK Q VN\u00d7\nImage featuresEncoder\nMulti-Head Self-AttentionAdd & NormMulti-Head AttentionAdd & NormFFNAdd & Norm\n/plus.osf /plus.osfK Q V/plus.osf /plus.osfK QM\u00d7Decoder\nV\nSpatial positional\nencodingObject queriesFFN FFNClass Bounding Box\nFig. 10: Architecture of DETR's transformer. Please, see Section A.3 for details.\nComputational complexity Every self-attention in the encoder has complex-\nityO(d2HW+d(HW)2):O(d0d) is the cost of computing a single query/key/value\nembeddings (and Md0=d), whileO(d0(HW)2) is the cost of computing the at-\ntention weights for one head. Other computations are negligible. In the decoder,\neach self-attention is in O(d2N+dN2), and cross-attention between encoder and\ndecoder is inO(d2(N+HW) +dNHW ), which is much lower than the encoder\nsinceN\u001cHW in practice.\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 23\nFLOPS computation Given that the FLOPS for Faster R-CNN depends on\nthe number of proposals in the image, we report the average number of FLOPS\nfor the \frst 100 images in the COCO 2017 validation set. We compute the\nFLOPS with the tool flop count operators from Detectron2 [50]. We use it\nwithout modi\fcations for Detectron2 models, and extend it to take batch matrix\nmultiply ( bmm) into account for DETR models.\nA.4 Training hyperparameters\nWe train DETR using AdamW [26] with improved weight decay handling, set to\n10\u00004. We also apply gradient clipping, with a maximal gradient norm of 0 :1. The\nbackbone and the transformers are treated slightly di\u000berently, we now discuss\nthe details for both.\nBackbone ImageNet pretrained backbone ResNet-50 is imported from Torchvi-\nsion, discarding the last classi\fcation layer. Backbone batch normalization weights\nand statistics are frozen during training, following widely adopted practice in ob-\nject detection. We \fne-tune the backbone using learning rate of 10\u00005. We observe\nthat having the backbone learning rate roughly an order of magnitude smaller\nthan the rest of the network is important to stabilize training, especially in the\n\frst few epochs.\nTransformer We train the transformer with a learning rate of 10\u00004. Additive\ndropout of 0 :1 is applied after every multi-head attention and FFN before layer\nnormalization. The weights are randomly initialized with Xavier initialization.\nLosses We use linear combination of `1and GIoU losses for bounding box re-\ngression with \u0015L1= 5 and\u0015iou= 2 weights respectively. All models were trained\nwithN= 100 decoder query slots.\nBaseline Our enhanced Faster-RCNN+ baselines use GIoU [38] loss along with\nthe standard `1loss for bounding box regression. We performed a grid search\nto \fnd the best weights for the losses and the \fnal models use only GIoU loss\nwith weights 20 and 1 for box and proposal regression tasks respectively. For the\nbaselines we adopt the same data augmentation as used in DETR and train it\nwith 9\u0002schedule (approximately 109 epochs). All other settings are identical to\nthe same models in the Detectron2 model zoo [50].\nSpatial positional encoding Encoder activations are associated with corre-\nsponding spatial positions of image features. In our model we use a \fxed absolute\nencoding to represent these spatial positions. We adopt a generalization of the\noriginal Transformer [47] encoding to the 2D case [31]. Speci\fcally, for both\nspatial coordinates of each embedding we independently used\n2sine and cosine\nfunctions with di\u000berent frequencies. We then concatenate them to get the \fnal\ndchannel positional encoding.\nA.5 Additional results\nSome extra qualitative results for the panoptic prediction of the DETR-R101\nmodel are shown in Fig.11.\n24 Carion et al.\n(a) Failure case with overlapping objects. PanopticFPN misses one plane entirely, while\nDETR fails to accurately segment 3 of them.\n(b)Things masks are predicted at full resolution, which allows sharper boundaries than\nPanopticFPN\nFig. 11: Comparison of panoptic predictions. From left to right: Ground truth, Panop-\nticFPN with ResNet 101, DETR with ResNet 101\nIncreasing the number of instances By design, DETR cannot predict more\nobjects than it has query slots, i.e. 100 in our experiments. In this section,\nwe analyze the behavior of DETR when approaching this limit. We select a\ncanonical square image of a given class, repeat it on a 10 \u000210 grid, and compute\nthe percentage of instances that are missed by the model. To test the model with\nless than 100 instances, we randomly mask some of the cells. This ensures that\nthe absolute size of the objects is the same no matter how many are visible. To\naccount for the randomness in the masking, we repeat the experiment 100 times\nwith di\u000berent masks. The results are shown in Fig.12. The behavior is similar\nacross classes, and while the model detects all instances when up to 50 are\nvisible, it then starts saturating and misses more and more instances. Notably,\nwhen the image contains all 100 instances, the model only detects 30 on average,\nwhich is less than if the image contains only 50 instances that are all detected.\nThe counter-intuitive behavior of the model is likely because the images and the\ndetections are far from the training distribution.\nNote that this test is a test of generalization out-of-distribution by design,\nsince there are very few example images with a lot of instances of a single class.\nIt is di\u000ecult to disentangle, from the experiment, two types of out-of-domain\ngeneralization: the image itself vs the number of object per class. But since few\nto no COCO images contain only a lot of objects of the same class, this type\nof experiment represents our best e\u000bort to understand whether query objects\nover\ft the label and position distribution of the dataset. Overall, the experiments\nsuggests that the model does not over\ft on these distributions since it yields\nnear-perfect detections up to 50 objects.\nEnd-to-End Object Detection with Transformers 25\n20 40 60 80 100010203040506070\nNumber of visible instances% of missed instancesdog\nperson\napple\nFig. 12: Analysis of the number of instances of various classes missed by DETR de-\npending on how many are present in the image. We report the mean and the standard\ndeviation. As the number of instances gets close to 100, DETR starts saturating and\nmisses more and more objects\nA.6 PyTorch inference code\nTo demonstrate the simplicity of the approach, we include inference code with\nPyTorch and Torchvision libraries in Listing 1. The code runs with Python 3.6+,\nPyTorch 1.4 and Torchvision 0.5. Note that it does not support batching, hence\nit is suitable only for inference or training with DistributedDataParallel with\none image per GPU. Also note that for clarity, this code uses learnt positional\nencodings in the encoder instead of \fxed, and positional encodings are added\nto the input only instead of at each transformer layer. Making these changes\nrequires going beyond PyTorch implementation of transformers, which hampers\nreadability. The entire code to reproduce the experiments will be made available\nbefore the conference.\n26 Carion et al.\n1 import torch\n2 from torch import nn\n3 from torchvision.models import resnet50\n4\n5 class DETR(nn.Module):\n6\n7 def __init__(self, num_classes, hidden_dim, nheads,\n8 num_encoder_layers, num_decoder_layers):\n9 super().__init__()\n10 # We take only convolutional layers from ResNet-50 model\n11 self.backbone = nn.Sequential(*list(resnet50(pretrained=True).children())[:-2])\n12 self.conv = nn.Conv2d(2048, hidden_dim, 1)\n13 self.transformer = nn.Transformer(hidden_dim, nheads,\n14 num_encoder_layers, num_decoder_layers)\n15 self.linear_class = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, num_classes + 1)\n16 self.linear_bbox = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, 4)\n17 self.query_pos = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(100, hidden_dim))\n18 self.row_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(50, hidden_dim // 2))\n19 self.col_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.rand(50, hidden_dim // 2))\n20\n21 def forward(self, inputs):\n22 x = self.backbone(inputs)\n23 h = self.conv(x)\n24 H, W = h.shape[-2:]\n25 pos = torch.cat([\n26 self.col_embed[:W].unsqueeze(0).repeat(H, 1, 1),\n27 self.row_embed[:H].unsqueeze(1).repeat(1, W, 1),\n28 ], dim=-1).flatten(0, 1).unsqueeze(1)\n29 h = self.transformer(pos + h.flatten(2).permute(2, 0, 1),\n30 self.query_pos.unsqueeze(1))\n31 return self.linear_class(h), self.linear_bbox(h).sigmoid()\n32\n33 detr = DETR(num_classes=91, hidden_dim=256, nheads=8, num_encoder_layers=6, num_decoder_layers=6)\n34 detr.eval()\n35 inputs = torch.randn(1, 3, 800, 1200)\n36 logits, bboxes = detr(inputs)\nListing 1: DETR PyTorch inference code.

Prior\nQFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical\nRAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose\na Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales\nwith both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be in-\ndexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages:\nfirst to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre-\ngenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a\nquestion, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before\nall partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a\nclass of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range,\nwe show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG\nbaseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An\nopen-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG\napproaches is forthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\n1 Introduction\nHuman endeavors across a range of domains rely on our ability to read and reason about large\ncollections of documents, often reaching conclusions that go beyond anything stated in the source\ntexts themselves. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), we are already witnessing\nattempts to automate human-like sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Mi-\ncrosoft, 2023) and intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023), where sensemaking is defined as\nPreprint.

This\nindex spans nodes (e.g., entities), edges (e.g., relationships), and covariates (e.g., claims) that have\nbeen detected, extracted, and summarized by LLM prompts tailored to the domain of the dataset.\nCommunity detection (e.g., Leiden, Traag et al., 2019) is used to partition the graph index into\ngroups of elements (nodes, edges, covariates) that the LLM can summarize in parallel at both index-\ning time and query time. The \u201cglobal answer\u201d to a given query is produced using a final round of\nquery-focused summarization over all community summaries reporting relevance to that query.\n\u201ca motivated, continuous effort to understand connections (which can be among people, places, and\nevents) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively \u201d (Klein et al., 2006a). Supporting\nhuman-led sensemaking over entire text corpora, however, needs a way for people to both apply and\nrefine their mental model of the data (Klein et al., 2006b) by asking questions of a global nature.\nRetrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to answering\nuser questions over entire datasets, but it is designed for situations where these answers are contained\nlocally within regions of text whose retrieval provides sufficient grounding for the generation task.\nInstead, a more appropriate task framing is query-focused summarization (QFS, Dang, 2006), and in\nparticular, query-focused abstractive summarization that generates natural language summaries and\nnot just concatenated excerpts (Baumel et al., 2018; Laskar et al., 2020; Yao et al., 2017) . In recent\nyears, however, such distinctions between summarization tasks that are abstractive versus extractive,\ngeneric versus query-focused, and single-document versus multi-document, have become less rele-\nvant. While early applications of the transformer architecture showed substantial improvements on\nthe state-of-the-art for all such summarization tasks (Goodwin et al., 2020; Laskar et al., 2022; Liu\nand Lapata, 2019), these tasks are now trivialized by modern LLMs, including the GPT (Achiam\net al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil et al., 2023) series,\nall of which can use in-context learning to summarize any content provided in their context window.\nThe challenge remains, however, for query-focused abstractive summarization over an entire corpus.\nSuch volumes of text can greatly exceed the limits of LLM context windows, and the expansion of\nsuch windows may not be enough given that information can be \u201clost in the middle\u201d of longer\ncontexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). In addition, although the direct retrieval of text\nchunks in na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG is likely inadequate for QFS tasks, it is possible that an alternative form of\npre-indexing could support a new RAG approach specifically targeting global summarization.\nIn this paper, we present a Graph RAG approach based on global summarization of an LLM-derived\nknowledge graph (Figure 1). In contrast with related work that exploits the structured retrieval\nand traversal affordances of graph indexes (subsection 4.2), we focus on a previously unexplored\nquality of graphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability of com-\nmunity detection algorithms to partition graphs into modular communities of closely-related nodes\n(e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al., 2008; Leiden, Traag et al., 2019). LLM-generated summaries of these\n2\n0 1 2 30100002000030000\nNumber of gleanings performedEntity references detected600 chunk size\n1200 chunk size\n2400 chunk size\nFigure 2: How the entity references detected in the HotPotQA dataset (Yang et al., 2018)\nvaries with chunk size and gleanings for our generic entity extraction prompt with gpt-4-turbo .\ncommunity descriptions provide complete coverage of the underlying graph index and the input doc-\numents it represents. Query-focused summarization of an entire corpus is then made possible using\na map-reduce approach: first using each community summary to answer the query independently\nand in parallel, then summarizing all relevant partial answers into a final global answer.\nTo evaluate this approach, we used an LLM to generate a diverse set of activity-centered sense-\nmaking questions from short descriptions of two representative real-world datasets, containing pod-\ncast transcripts and news articles respectively. For the target qualities of comprehensiveness, diver-\nsity, and empowerment (defined in subsection 3.4) that develop understanding of broad issues and\nthemes, we both explore the impact of varying the the hierarchical level of community summaries\nused to answer queries, as well as compare to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and global map-reduce summarization\nof source texts. We show that all global approaches outperform na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG on comprehensiveness\nand diversity, and that Graph RAG with intermediate- and low-level community summaries shows\nfavorable performance over source text summarization on these same metrics, at lower token costs.\n2 Graph RAG Approach & Pipeline\nWe now unpack the high-level data flow of the Graph RAG approach (Figure 1) and pipeline, de-\nscribing key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\n2.1 Source Documents \u2192Text Chunks\nA fundamental design decision is the granularity with which input texts extracted from source doc-\numents should be split into text chunks for processing. In the following step, each of these chunks\nwill be passed to a set of LLM prompts designed to extract the various elements of a graph index.\nLonger text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction, but suffer from the recall degrada-\ntion of longer LLM context windows (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023). This behavior can be\nobserved in Figure 2 in the case of a single extraction round (i.e., with zero gleanings): on a sample\ndataset (HotPotQA, Yang et al., 2018), using a chunk size of 600 token extracted almost twice as\nmany entity references as when using a chunk size of 2400. While more references are generally\nbetter, any extraction process needs to balance recall and precision for the target activity.\n2.2 Text Chunks \u2192Element Instances\nThe baseline requirement for this step is to identify and extract instances of graph nodes and edges\nfrom each chunk of source text. We do this using a multipart LLM prompt that first identifies all\nentities in the text, including their name, type, and description, before identifying all relationships\nbetween clearly-related entities, including the source and target entities and a description of their\nrelationship. Both kinds of element instance are output in a single list of delimited tuples.\nThe primary opportunity to tailor this prompt to the domain of the document corpus lies in the\nchoice of few-shot examples provided to the LLM for in-context learning (Brown et al., 2020).\n3\nFor example, while our default prompt extracting the broad class of \u201cnamed entities\u201d like people,\nplaces, and organizations is generally applicable, domains with specialized knowledge (e.g., science,\nmedicine, law) will benefit from few-shot examples specialized to those domains. We also support\na secondary extraction prompt for any additional covariates we would like to associate with the\nextracted node instances. Our default covariate prompt aims to extract claims linked to detected\nentities, including the subject, object, type, description, source text span, and start and end dates.\nTo balance the needs of efficiency and quality, we use multiple rounds of \u201cgleanings\u201d, up to a\nspecified maximum, to encourage the LLM to detect any additional entities it may have missed\non prior extraction rounds. This is a multi-stage process in which we first ask the LLM to assess\nwhether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of 100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM\nresponds that entities were missed, then a continuation indicating that \u201cMANY entities were missed\nin the last extraction\u201d encourages the LLM to glean these missing entities. This approach allows us\nto use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality (Figure 2) or the forced introduction of noise.\n2.3 Element Instances \u2192Element Summaries\nThe use of an LLM to \u201cextract\u201d descriptions of entities, relationships, and claims represented in\nsource texts is already a form of abstractive summarization, relying on the LLM to create inde-\npendently meaningful summaries of concepts that may be implied but not stated by the text itself\n(e.g., the presence of implied relationships). To convert all such instance-level summaries into sin-\ngle blocks of descriptive text for each graph element (i.e., entity node, relationship edge, and claim\ncovariate) requires a further round of LLM summarization over matching groups of instances.\nA potential concern at this stage is that the LLM may not consistently extract references to the\nsame entity in the same text format, resulting in duplicate entity elements and thus duplicate nodes\nin the entity graph. However, since all closely-related \u201ccommunities\u201d of entities will be detected\nand summarized in the following step, and given that LLMs can understand the common entity\nbehind multiple name variations, our overall approach is resilient to such variations provided there\nis sufficient connectivity from all variations to a shared set of closely-related entities.\nOverall, our use of rich descriptive text for homogeneous nodes in a potentially noisy graph structure\nis aligned with both the capabilities of LLMs and the needs of global, query-focused summarization.\nThese qualities also differentiate our graph index from typical knowledge graphs, which rely on\nconcise and consistent knowledge triples (subject, predicate, object) for downstream reasoning tasks.\n2.4 Element Summaries \u2192Graph Communities\nThe index created in the previous step can be modelled as an homogeneous undirected weighted\ngraph in which entity nodes are connected by relationship edges, with edge weights representing the\nnormalized counts of detected relationship instances. Given such a graph, a variety of community\ndetection algorithms may be used to partition the graph into communities of nodes with stronger\nconnections to one another than to the other nodes in the graph (e.g., see the surveys by Fortu-\nnato, 2010 and Jin et al., 2021). In our pipeline, we use Leiden (Traag et al., 2019) on account of\nits ability to recover hierarchical community structure of large-scale graphs efficiently (Figure 3).\nEach level of this hierarchy provides a community partition that covers the nodes of the graph in a\nmutually-exclusive, collective-exhaustive way, enabling divide-and-conquer global summarization.\n2.5 Graph Communities \u2192Community Summaries\nThe next step is to create report-like summaries of each community in the Leiden hierarchy, using\na method designed to scale to very large datasets. These summaries are independently useful in\ntheir own right as a way to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may\nthemselves be used to make sense of a corpus in the absence of a question. For example, a user\nmay scan through community summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then\nfollow links to the reports at the lower level that provide more details for each of the subtopics. Here,\nhowever, we focus on their utility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\nCommunity summaries are generated in the following way:\n4\n(a) Root communities at level 0 (b) Sub-communities at level 1\nFigure 3: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\nMultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\n\u2022Leaf-level communities . The element summaries of a leaf-level community (nodes, edges,\ncovariates) are prioritized and then iteratively added to the LLM context window until\nthe token limit is reached. The prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in\ndecreasing order of combined source and target node degree (i.e., overall prominance), add\ndescriptions of the source node, target node, linked covariates, and the edge itself.\n\u2022Higher-level communities . If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\nassociated element summaries (longer) until fit within the context window is achieved.\n2.6 Community Summaries \u2192Community Answers \u2192Global Answer\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\na final answer in a multi-stage process. The hierarchical nature of the community structure also\nmeans that questions can be answered using the community summaries from different levels, raising\nthe question of whether a particular level in the hierarchical community structure offers the best\nbalance of summary detail and scope for general sensemaking questions (evaluated in section 3).\nFor a given community level, the global answer to any user query is generated as follows:\n\u2022Prepare community summaries . Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.\n\u2022Map community answers . Generate intermediate answers in parallel, one for each chunk.\nThe LLM is also asked to generate a score between 0-100 indicating how helpful the gen-\nerated answer is in answering the target question. Answers with score 0 are filtered out.\n\u2022Reduce to global answer . Intermediate community answers are sorted in descending order\nof helpfulness score and iteratively added into a new context window until the token limit\nis reached. This final context is used to generate the global answer returned to the user.\n5\nDataset Example activity framing and generation of global sensemaking questions\nPodcast\ntranscriptsUser : A tech journalist looking for insights and trends in the tech industry\nTask: Understanding how tech leaders view the role of policy and regulation\nQuestions :\n1.

Questions target global understanding rather than specific details.\n3 Evaluation\n3.1 Datasets\nWe selected two datasets in the one million token range, each equivalent to about 10 novels of text\nand representative of the kind of corpora that users may encounter in their real world activities:\n\u2022Podcast transcripts . Compiled transcripts of podcast conversations between Kevin Scott,\nMicrosoft CTO, and other technology leaders (Behind the Tech, Scott, 2024). Size: 1669\n\u00d7600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1 million tokens).\n\u2022News articles . Benchmark dataset comprising news articles published from September\n2013 to December 2023 in a range of categories, including entertainment, business, sports,\ntechnology, health, and science (MultiHop-RAG; Tang and Yang, 2024). Size: 3197 \u00d7\n600-token text chunks, with 100-token overlaps between chunks ( \u223c1.7 million tokens).\n3.2 Queries\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\nthe associated question sets target explicit fact retrieval rather than summarization for the purpose\nof data sensemaking, i.e., the process though which people inspect, engage with, and contextualize\ndata within the broader scope of real-world activities (Koesten et al., 2021). Similarly, methods for\nextracting latent summarization queries from source texts also exist (Xu and Lapata, 2021), but such\nextracted questions can target details that betray prior knowledge of the texts.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of RAG systems for more global sensemaking tasks, we need questions\nthat convey only a high-level understanding of dataset contents, and not the details of specific texts.\nWe used an activity-centered approach to automate the generation of such questions: given a short\ndescription of a dataset, we asked the LLM to identify Npotential users and Ntasks per user,\nthen for each (user, task) combination, we asked the LLM to generate Nquestions that require\nunderstanding of the entire corpus. For our evaluation, a value of N= 5 resulted in 125 test questions\nper dataset. Table 1 shows example questions for each of the two evaluation datasets.\n6\n3.3 Conditions\nWe compare six different conditions in our analysis, including Graph RAG using four levels of graph\ncommunities ( C0,C1,C2,C3), a text summarization method applying our map-reduce approach\ndirectly to source texts ( TS), and a na \u00a8\u0131ve \u201csemantic search\u201d RAG approach ( SS):\n\u2022CO. Uses root-level community summaries (fewest in number) to answer user queries.\n\u2022C1. Uses high-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-communities\nof C0, if present, otherwise C0 communities projected down.\n\u2022C2. Uses intermediate-level community summaries to answer queries. These are sub-\ncommunities of C1, if present, otherwise C1 communities projected down.\n\u2022C3. Uses low-level community summaries (greatest in number) to answer queries. These\nare sub-communities of C2, if present, otherwise C2 communities projected down.\n\u2022TS. The same method as in subsection 2.6, except source texts (rather than community\nsummaries) are shuffled and chunked for the map-reduce summarization stages.\n\u2022SS. An implementation of na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG in which text chunks are retrieved and added to the\navailable context window until the specified token limit is reached.\nThe size of the context window and the prompts used for answer generation are the same across\nall six conditions (except for minor modifications to reference styles to match the types of context\ninformation used). Conditions only differ in how the contents of the context window are created.\nThe graph index supporting conditions C0-C3was created using our generic prompts for entity and\nrelationship extraction only, with entity types and few-shot examples tailored to the domain of the\ndata. The graph indexing process used a context window size of 600 tokens with 1 gleaning for the\nPodcast dataset and 0 gleanings for the News dataset.\n3.4 Metrics\nLLMs have been shown to be good evaluators of natural language generation, achieving state-of-\nthe-art or competitive results compared against human judgements (Wang et al., 2023a; Zheng et al.,\n2024). While this approach can generate reference-based metrics when gold standard answers are\nknown, it is also capable of measuring the qualities of generated texts (e.g., fluency) in a reference-\nfree style (Wang et al., 2023a) as well as in head-to-head comparison of competing outputs (LLM-\nas-a-judge, Zheng et al., 2024). LLMs have also shown promise at evaluating the performance of\nconventional RAG systems, automatically evaluating qualities like context relevance, faithfulness,\nand answer relevance (RAGAS, Es et al., 2023).\nGiven the multi-stage nature of our Graph RAG mechanism, the multiple conditions we wanted to\ncompare, and the lack of gold standard answers to our activity-based sensemaking questions, we\ndecided to adopt a head-to-head comparison approach using an LLM evaluator. We selected three\ntarget metrics capturing qualities that are desirable for sensemaking activities, as well as a control\nmetric (directness) used as a indicator of validity. Since directness is effectively in opposition to\ncomprehensiveness and diversity, we would not expect any method to win across all four metrics.\nOur head-to-head measures computed using an LLM evaluator are as follows:\n\u2022Comprehensiveness . How much detail does the answer provide to cover all aspects and\ndetails of the question?\n\u2022Diversity . How varied and rich is the answer in providing different perspectives and insights\non the question?\n\u2022Empowerment . How well does the answer help the reader understand and make informed\njudgements about the topic?\n\u2022Directness . How specifically and clearly does the answer address the question?\nFor our evaluation, the LLM is provided with the question, target metric, and a pair of answers, and\nasked to assess which answer is better according to the metric, as well as why. It returns the winner\nif one exists, otherwise a tie if they are fundamentally similar and the differences are negligible.\nTo account for the stochasticity of LLMs, we run each comparison five times and use mean scores.\nTable 2 shows an example of LLM-generated assessment.\n7\nQuestion Which public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\nGraph\nRAGOverview of Prominent Public Figures in Entertainment\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\ndigital media. Certain public figures stand out due to their significant contributions and influence\nacross these sectors. The following summary highlights key individuals who are repeatedly\nmentioned in various entertainment articles, reflecting their impact and presence within the industry.\nActors and Directors [...]Public Figures in Controversy [...]Musicians and Executives [...]\nAthletes and Coaches [...]Influencers and Entrepreneurs [...]\nThe repeated mention of these figures in entertainment articles signifies their ongoing relevance and\nthe public\u2019s interest in their work. Their influence spans across various aspects of entertainment, from\nshaping cultural narratives in film and television to driving trends in music and digital media. These\nindividuals not only contribute to their respective fields but also influence the broader cultural\nlandscape, often becoming central figures in social discussions and public discourse.\nNa\u00a8\u0131ve\nRAGPublic figures who are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles include Taylor\nSwift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin Timberlake. These individuals have been highlighted\nfor various reasons, ranging from their professional achievements to their personal lives.\nTaylor Swift [...]Travis Kelce [...]Britney Spears [...]Justin Timberlake [...]\nThese figures are frequently covered due to their high-profile status and the public\u2019s interest in their\ncareers and personal lives. Their activities, whether in music, sports, or personal relationships, have\nsignificant cultural and economic impacts, as evidenced by the media coverage and public reactions.\nLLM\nDecisionComprehensiveness: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more comprehensive and detailed list of public figures from a\nwider range of entertainment sectors, including film, television, music, sports, gaming, and digital\nmedia. It also includes specific examples of their contributions and the impact they have on their\nrespective fields, as well as mentions of controversies and their implications. Answer 2, while\ndetailed in its coverage of a few individuals, is limited to a smaller number of public figures and\nfocuses primarily on their personal lives and relationships rather than a broad spectrum of their\nprofessional influence across the entertainment industry.\nDiversity: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a more varied and rich response by covering a wide range of\npublic figures from different sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music,\nsports, gaming, and digital media. It offers insights into the contributions and influence of these\nfigures, as well as controversies and their impact on public discourse. The answer also cites specific\ndata sources for each mentioned figure, indicating a diverse range of evidence to support the claims.\nIn contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures, primarily from the music industry\nand sports, and relies heavily on a single source for data, which makes it less diverse in perspectives\nand insights.\nEmpowerment: Winner=1 (Graph RAG)\nAnswer 1 is better because it provides a comprehensive and structured overview of public figures\nacross various sectors of the entertainment industry, including film, television, music, sports, and\ndigital media. It lists multiple individuals, providing specific examples of their contributions and the\ncontext in which they are mentioned in entertainment articles, along with references to data reports\nfor each claim. This approach helps the reader understand the breadth of the topic and make informed\njudgments without being misled. In contrast, Answer 2 focuses on a smaller group of public figures\nand primarily discusses their personal lives and relationships, which may not provide as broad an\nunderstanding of the topic. While Answer 2 also cites sources, it does not match the depth and variety\nof Answer 1.\nDirectness: Winner=2 (Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG)\nAnswer 2 is better because it directly lists specific public figures who are repeatedly mentioned\nacross various entertainment articles, such as Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce, Britney Spears, and Justin\nTimberlake, and provides concise explanations for their frequent mentions. Answer 1, while\ncomprehensive, includes a lot of detailed information about various figures in different sectors of\nentertainment, which, while informative, does not directly answer the question with the same level of\nconciseness and specificity as Answer 2.\nTable 2: Example question for the News article dataset, with generated answers from Graph RAG\n(C2) and Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG, as well as LLM-generated assessments.\n8\nPodcast transcripts\n501728252221\n835050484344\n725050535049\n755247505250\n785750485052\n795651504850SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nComprehensiveness501823251919\n825050504346\n775050504644\n755050504445\n815754565048\n815456555250SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nDiversity504257524951\n585059555251\n434150494748\n484551504950\n514853515051\n494952504950SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nEmpowerment505665606060\n445055525152\n354550474848\n404853505050\n404952505050\n404852505050SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nDirectness\nNews articles\n502028252121\n805044413836\n725650525452\n755948505855\n796246425059\n796448454150SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nComprehensiveness503338352931\n675053454440\n624750404141\n655560505050\n715659505051\n696059504950SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nDiversity504757495050\n535058505048\n434250424544\n515058505251\n505055485050\n505256495050SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nEmpowerment505459555554\n465055535252\n414550484847\n454752504949\n454852515049\n464853515150SS\nTS\nC0\nC1\nC2\nC3SSTSC0C1C2C3\nDirectness\nFigure 4: Head-to-head win rate percentages of (row condition) over (column condition) across two\ndatasets, four metrics, and 125 questions per comparison (each repeated five times and averaged).\nThe overall winner per dataset and metric is shown in bold. Self-win rates were not computed but\nare shown as the expected 50% for reference. All Graph RAG conditions outperformed na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG\non comprehensiveness and diversity. Conditions C1-C3 also showed slight improvements in answer\ncomprehensiveness and diversity over TS (global text summarization without a graph index).\n3.5 Configuration\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\nbe \u201clost in the middle\u201d of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-\nplore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\n3.6 Results\nThe indexing process resulted in a graph consisting of 8564 nodes and 20691 edges for the Podcast\ndataset, and a larger graph of 15754 nodes and 19520 edges for the News dataset. Table 3 shows the\nnumber of community summaries at different levels of each graph community hierarchy.\nGlobal approaches vs. na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG . As shown in Figure 4, global approaches consistently out-\nperformed the na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG ( SS) approach in both comprehensiveness and diversity metrics across\ndatasets. Specifically, global approaches achieved comprehensiveness win rates between 72-83%\nfor Podcast transcripts and 72-80% for News articles, while diversity win rates ranged from 75-82%\nand 62-71% respectively. Our use of directness as a validity test also achieved the expected results,\ni.e., that na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG produces the most direct responses across all comparisons.\n9\nPodcast Transcripts News Articles\nC0 C1 C2 C3 TS C0 C1 C2 C3 TS\nUnits 34 367 969 1310 1669 55 555 1797 2142 3197\nTokens 26657 225756 565720 746100 1014611 39770 352641 980898 1140266 1707694\n% Max 2.6 22.2 55.8 73.5 100 2.3 20.7 57.4 66.8 100\nTable 3: Number of context units (community summaries for C0-C3 and text chunks for TS), corre-\nsponding token counts, and percentage of the maximum token count. Map-reduce summarization of\nsource texts is the most resource-intensive approach requiring the highest number of context tokens.\nRoot-level community summaries ( C0) require dramatically fewer tokens per query (9x-43x).\nCommunity summaries vs. source texts. When comparing community summaries to source texts\nusing Graph RAG, community summaries generally provided a small but consistent improvement\nin answer comprehensiveness and diversity, except for root-level summaries. Intermediate-level\nsummaries in the Podcast dataset and low-level community summaries in the News dataset achieved\ncomprehensiveness win rates of 57% and 64%, respectively. Diversity win rates were 57% for\nPodcast intermediate-level summaries and 60% for News low-level community summaries. Table 3\nalso illustrates the scalability advantages of Graph RAG compared to source text summarization: for\nlow-level community summaries ( C3), Graph RAG required 26-33% fewer context tokens, while\nfor root-level community summaries ( C0), it required over 97% fewer tokens. For a modest drop in\nperformance compared with other global methods, root-level Graph RAG offers a highly efficient\nmethod for the iterative question answering that characterizes sensemaking activity, while retaining\nadvantages in comprehensiveness (72% win rate) and diversity (62% win rate) over na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG.\nEmpowerment . Empowerment comparisons showed mixed results for both global approaches versus\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG ( SS) and Graph RAG approaches versus source text summarization ( TS). Ad-hoc LLM\nuse to analyze LLM reasoning for this measure indicated that the ability to provide specific exam-\nples, quotes, and citations was judged to be key to helping users reach an informed understanding.\nTuning element extraction prompts may help to retain more of these details in the Graph RAG index.\n4 Related Work\n4.1 RAG Approaches and Systems\nWhen using LLMs, RAG involves first retrieving relevant information from external data sources,\nthen adding this information to the context window of the LLM along with the original query (Ram\net al., 2023). Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG approaches (Gao et al., 2023) do this by converting documents to text,\nsplitting text into chunks, and embedding these chunks into a vector space in which similar positions\nrepresent similar semantics. Queries are then embedded into the same vector space, with the text\nchunks of the nearest kvectors used as context. More advanced variations exist, but all solve the\nproblem of what to do when an external dataset of interest exceeds the LLM\u2019s context window.\nAdvanced RAG systems include pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval strategies designed to over-\ncome the drawbacks of Na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG, while Modular RAG systems include patterns for iterative and\ndynamic cycles of interleaved retrieval and generation (Gao et al., 2023). Our implementation of\nGraph RAG incorporates multiple concepts related to other systems. For example, our community\nsummaries are a kind of self-memory (Selfmem, Cheng et al., 2024) for generation-augmented re-\ntrieval (GAR, Mao et al., 2020) that facilitates future generation cycles, while our parallel generation\nof community answers from these summaries is a kind of iterative (Iter-RetGen, Shao et al., 2023)\nor federated (FeB4RAG, Wang et al., 2024) retrieval-generation strategy. Other systems have also\ncombined these concepts for multi-document summarization (CAiRE-COVID, Su et al., 2020) and\nmulti-hop question answering (ITRG, Feng et al., 2023; IR-CoT, Trivedi et al., 2022; DSP, Khattab\net al., 2022). Our use of a hierarchical index and summarization also bears resemblance to further\napproaches, such as generating a hierarchical index of text chunks by clustering the vectors of text\nembeddings (RAPTOR, Sarthi et al., 2024) or generating a \u201ctree of clarifications\u201d to answer mul-\ntiple interpretations of ambiguous questions (Kim et al., 2023). However, none of these iterative or\nhierarchical approaches use the kind of self-generated graph index that enables Graph RAG.\n10\n4.2 Graphs and LLMs\nUse of graphs in connection with LLMs and RAG is a developing research area, with multiple\ndirections already established. These include using LLMs for knowledge graph creation (Tra-\njanoska et al., 2023) and completion (Yao et al., 2023), as well as for the extraction of causal\ngraphs (Ban et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) from source texts. They also include forms of ad-\nvanced RAG (Gao et al., 2023) where the index is a knowledge graph (KAPING, Baek et al., 2023),\nwhere subsets of the graph structure (G-Retriever, He et al., 2024) or derived graph metrics (Graph-\nToolFormer, Zhang, 2023) are the objects of enquiry, where narrative outputs are strongly grounded\nin the facts of retrieved subgraphs (SURGE, Kang et al., 2023), where retrieved event-plot sub-\ngraphs are serialized using narrative templates (FABULA, Ranade and Joshi, 2023), and where the\nsystem supports both creation and traversal of text-relationship graphs for multi-hop question an-\nswering (Wang et al., 2023b). In terms of open-source software, a variety a graph databases are\nsupported by both the LangChain (LangChain, 2024) and LlamaIndex (LlamaIndex, 2024) libraries,\nwhile a more general class of graph-based RAG applications is also emerging, including systems that\ncan create and reason over knowledge graphs in both Neo4J (NaLLM, Neo4J, 2024) and Nebula-\nGraph (GraphRAG, NebulaGraph, 2024) formats. Unlike our Graph RAG approach, however, none\nof these systems use the natural modularity of graphs to partition data for global summarization.\n5 Discussion\nLimitations of evaluation approach . Our evaluation to date has only examined a certain class of\nsensemaking questions for two corpora in the region of 1 million tokens. More work is needed\nto understand how performance varies across different ranges of question types, data types, and\ndataset sizes, as well as to validate our sensemaking questions and target metrics with end users.\nComparison of fabrication rates, e.g., using approaches like SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023),\nwould also improve on the current analysis.\nTrade-offs of building a graph index . We consistently observed Graph RAG achieve the best head-\nto-head results against other methods, but in many cases the graph-free approach to global summa-\nrization of source texts performed competitively. The real-world decision about whether to invest in\nbuilding a graph index depends on multiple factors, including the compute budget, expected number\nof lifetime queries per dataset, and value obtained from other aspects of the graph index (including\nthe generic community summaries and the use of other graph-related RAG approaches).\nFuture work . The graph index, rich text annotations, and hierarchical community structure support-\ning the current Graph RAG approach offer many possibilities for refinement and adaptation. This\nincludes RAG approaches that operate in a more local manner, via embedding-based matching of\nuser queries and graph annotations, as well as the possibility of hybrid RAG schemes that combine\nembedding-based matching against community reports before employing our map-reduce summa-\nrization mechanisms. This \u201croll-up\u201d operation could also be extended across more levels of the\ncommunity hierarchy, as well as implemented as a more exploratory \u201cdrill down\u201d mechanism that\nfollows the information scent contained in higher-level community summaries.\n6 Conclusion\nWe have presented a global approach to Graph RAG, combining knowledge graph generation,\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and query-focused summarization (QFS) to support human\nsensemaking over entire text corpora. Initial evaluations show substantial improvements over a\nna\u00a8\u0131ve RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, as well as favorable\ncomparisons to a global but graph-free approach using map-reduce source text summarization. For\nsituations requiring many global queries over the same dataset, summaries of root-level communi-\nties in the entity-based graph index provide a data index that is both superior to na \u00a8\u0131ve RAG and\nachieves competitive performance to other global methods at a fraction of the token cost.\nAn open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is\nforthcoming at https://aka .ms/graphrag .\n11\nAcknowledgements\nWe would also like to thank the following people who contributed to the work: Alonso Guevara\nFern \u00b4andez, Amber Hoak, Andr \u00b4es Morales Esquivel, Ben Cutler, Billie Rinaldi, Chris Sanchez,\nChris Trevino, Christine Caggiano, David Tittsworth, Dayenne de Souza, Douglas Orbaker, Ed\nClark, Gabriel Nieves-Ponce, Gaudy Blanco Meneses, Kate Lytvynets, Katy Smith, M \u00b4onica Carva-\njal, Nathan Evans, Richard Ortega, Rodrigo Racanicci, Sarah Smith, and Shane Solomon.\nReferences\nAchiam, J., Adler, S., Agarwal, S., Ahmad, L., Akkaya, I., Aleman, F.

In this work, we\npropose a novel SGG method to address the aforementioned\nissues, formulating the task as a bipartite graph construction\nproblem. To solve the problem, we develop a transformer-\nbased end-to-end framework that \ufb01rst generates the entity\nand predicate proposal set, followed by inferring directed\nedges to form the relation triplets. In particular, we de-\nvelop a new entity-aware predicate representation based on\na structural predicate generator that leverages the compo-\nsitional property of relationships. Moreover, we design a\ngraph assembling module to infer the connectivity of the\nbipartite scene graph based on our entity-aware structure,\nenabling us to generate the scene graph in an end-to-end\nmanner. Extensive experimental results show that our design\nis able to achieve the state-of-the-art or comparable perfor-\nmance on two challenging benchmarks, surpassing most of\nthe existing approaches and enjoying higher ef\ufb01ciency in\ninference. We hope our model can serve as a strong baseline\nfor the Transformer-based scene graph generation.1\n1. Introduction\nInferring structural properties of a scene, such as the\nrelationship between entities, is a fundamental visual under-\nstanding task. The visual relationship between two entities\ncan be typically represented by a triple <subject entity, pred-\nicate, object entity> . Based on the visual relationships, a\nscene can be modeled as a graph structure, with entities as\nnodes and predicates as edges, referred to as scene graph.\nThe scene graph provides a compact structural representation\n1This work was supported by Shanghai Science and Technology Pro-\ngram 21010502700.

The illustration of SGTR pipeline paradigm. We\nformulate SGG as a bipartite graph construction process. First, the\nentity and predicate nodes are generated, respectively. Then we\nassemble the bipartite scene graph from two types of nodes.\nfor a visual scene, which has potential applications in many\nvision tasks such as visual question answering [8, 28, 34],\nimage captioning [46, 47] and image retrieval [9].\nDifferent from the traditional vision tasks ( e.g., object\ndetection) that focus on entity instances, the main challenge\nof scene graph generation (SGG) lies in building an effective\nand ef\ufb01cient model for the relations between the entities. The\ncompositional property of visual relationships induces high\ncomplexity in terms of their constituents, which makes it\ndif\ufb01cult to learn a compact representation of the relationship\nconcept for localization and/or classi\ufb01cation.\nMost previous works attempt to tackle this problem using\ntwo distinct design patterns: bottom-up two-stage [1, 4, 5, 7,\n15, 19, 44, 48] and point-based one-stage design [6, 24]. The\nformer typically \ufb01rst detects Nentity proposals, followed by\npredicting the predicate categories of those entity combina-\ntions. While this strategy achieves high recalls in discovering\nrelation instances, its O(N2)predicate proposals not only\nincur considerable computation cost but also produce sub-\nstantial noise in context modeling. In the one-stage methods,\nentities and predicates are often extracted separately fromarXiv:2112.12970v3  [cs.CV]  31 Mar 2022\nthe image in order to reduce the size of relation proposal set.\nNonetheless, they rely on a strong assumption of the non-\noverlapping property of interaction regions, which severely\nrestricts their application in modeling complex scenes2.\nIn this work, we aim to tackle the aforementioned lim-\nitation by leveraging the compositional property of scene\ngraphs. To this end, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we \ufb01rst formulate\nthe SGG task as a bipartite graph construction problem, in\nwhich each relationship triplet is represented as two types of\nnodes (entity and predicate) linked by directed edges. Such a\nbipartite graph allows us to jointly generate entity/predicate\nproposals and their potential associations, yielding a rich\nhypothesis space for inferring visual relations. More impor-\ntantly, we propose a novel entity-aware predicate represen-\ntation that incorporates relevant entity proposal information\ninto each predicate node. This enriches the predicate repre-\nsentations and therefore enables us to produce a relatively\nsmall number of high-quality predicate proposals. More-\nover, such a representation encodes potential associations\nbetween each predicate and its subject/object entities, which\ncan facilitate predicting the graph edges and lead to ef\ufb01cient\ngeneration of the visual relation triplets.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we develop a new transformer-based end-to-\nend SGG model, dubbed Scene graph Generation TRans-\nformer (SGTR), for constructing the bipartite graph. Our\nmodel consists of three main modules, including an entity\nnode generator , apredicate node generator and a graph\nassembling module . Given an image, we \ufb01rst introduce two\nCNN+Transformer sub-networks as the entity and predicate\ngenerator to produce a set of entity and predicate nodes,\nrespectively. To compute the entity-aware predicate repre-\nsentations, we design a structural predicate generator con-\nsisting of three parallel transformer decoders, which fuses\nthe predicate feature with an entity indicator representation.\nAfter generating entity and predicate node representations,\nwe then devise a differentiable graph assembling module\nto infer the directed edges of the bipartite graph, which ex-\nploits the entity indicator to predict the best grouping of the\nentity and predicate nodes. With end-to-end training, our\nSGTR learns to infer a sparse set of relation proposals from\nboth input images and entity proposals adaptively, which can\nmitigate the impact of noisy object detection.\nWe validate our method by extensive experiments on\ntwo SGG benchmarks: We validate our method by exten-\nsive experiments on two SGG benchmarks: Visual Genome\nand OpenImages-V6 datasets, with comparisons to previous\nstate-of-the-art methods. The results show that our method\noutperforms or achieves comparable performance on both\nbenchmarks and with high ef\ufb01ciency during inference.\nThe main contribution of our work has three-folds:\n\u2022We propose a novel transformer-based end-to-end scene\n2e.g., two different relationships cannot have largely overlapped area \u2013\na phenomenon also discussed in the recent works on (HOI) [3, 31]graph generation method with a bipartite graph con-\nstruction process that inherits the advantages of both\ntwo-stage and one-stage methods.\n\u2022We develop an entity-aware structure for exploiting the\ncompositional properties of visual relationships.\n\u2022Our method achieves the state-of-the-art or comparable\nperformance on all metrics w.r.t the prior SGG methods\nand with more ef\ufb01cient inference.\n2. Related Works\nWe categorize the related work of SGG/HOI according\nto three research directions: Two-stage Scene Graph Gener-\nation ,One-stage Scene Graph Generation , and One-stage\nHuman-Object Interaction .\nTwo-stage Scene Graph Generation Two-stage SGG\nmethods predict the relationships between densely con-\nnected entity pairs. Based on dense relationship propos-\nals, many previous works focus on modeling contextual\nstructure [11, 19 \u201321, 23, 27, 33, 38, 39, 41, 42, 45, 50 \u201355].\nRecent studies develop logit adjustment and other training\nstrategies to address the long-tail recognition in the SGG\ntask [1,4,5,7,14,15,19,29,32,38,43,44,48]. The two-stage\ndesign is capable of handling complex scenarios encountered\nin SGG.\nHowever, as discussed in Sec. 1, the dense relation\nproposal generation often leads to high time complexity\nand unavoidable noise in context modeling. Many two-\nstage works propose heuristic designs to address these is-\nsues ( e.g., proposal generation [45], ef\ufb01cient context model-\ning [19, 20, 27, 33, 39, 47]). However, these sophisticated de-\nsigns often rely on the speci\ufb01c properties of the downstream\ntasks, which limits the \ufb02exibility of their representation learn-\ning and is dif\ufb01cult to achieve end-to-end optimization.\nOne-stage Scene Graph Generation Inspired by the fully\nconvolutional one-stage object detection methods [2, 30, 36],\nthe SGG community starts to explore the one-stage de-\nsign. The fully convolutional network [24, 35] or CNN-\nTransformer [6] architecture is used in the one-stage methods\nto detect the relationship from image features directly. These\none-stage frameworks typically can perform ef\ufb01ciently due\nto their sparse proposal set. Nonetheless, without explicit\nentity modeling, those designs may struggle to capture the\ncomplex visual relationships associated with real-world sce-\nnarios. Moreover, the majority of one-stage methods ignore\nentity-relation consistency as they predict each relationship\nindependently rather than a valid graph structure with con-\nsistent node-edge constraint.\nOne-stage Human-Object Interaction Our work is also re-\nlated to the Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task. There has\nbeen a recent trend toward studying the one-stage framework\nfor Human-Object Interaction [3,12,13,22,31,37,56,62]. In\nparticular, [3,13] introduce an intriguing framework based on\na dual decoder structure that simultaneously extracts the hu-\nman, object, and interaction and then groups the components\ninto \ufb01nal triplets. This decoding-grouping approach provides\na divide-and-conquer strategy for detecting the human and\ninteracted object. Inspired by this design, we propose the bi-\npartite graph construction method in our SGTR for the more\ngeneral SGG task. To further improve the association mod-\neling between entity and predicate, we propose a predicate\nnode generator with an entity-aware structure and a graph\nassembling mechanism. With such a design, the SGTR is\nable to handle the complex composition of relationships and\nachieve strong performance on SGG benchmarks.\n3. Preliminary\nIn this section, we \ufb01rst introduce the problem setting\nof scene graph generation in Sec. 3.1, and then present an\noverview of our approach in Sec. 3.2.\n3.1. Problem Setting\nThe task of scene graph generation aims to parse an input\ninto a scene graphGscene ={Ve,Er}, whereVeis the node\nset denoting noun entities and Eris the edge set that repre-\nsents predicates between pairs of subject and object entities.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, each entity vi\u2208Vehas a category label from\na set of entity classes Ceand a bounding box depicting its\nlocation in the image, while each edge ei\u2192j\u2208Erbetween a\npair of nodes viandvjis associated with a predicate label\nfrom a set of predicate classes Cpin this task.\nOne possible way to generate the scene graph Gscene is by\nextracting the relationship triplet set from the given image.\nIn this work, we formulate the relationship triplet generation\nprocess as a bipartite graph construction task [19]. Specif-\nically, our graph consists of two groups of nodes Ve,Vp,\nwhich correspond to entity representation and predicate\nrepresentation, respectively. These two groups of nodes\nare connected by two sets of directed edges Ee\u2192p,Ep\u2192e\nrepresenting the direction from the entities to predicates\nand vice versa. Hence the bipartite graph has a form as\nGb={Ve,Vp,Ee\u2192p,Ep\u2192e}.\n3.2. Model Overview\nOur model de\ufb01nes a differentiable function Fsggthat\ntakes an image Ias the input and outputs the bipartite graph\nGb, denoted asGb=Fsgg(I), which allows end-to-end train-\ning. We propose to explicitly model the bipartite graph con-\nstruction process by leveraging the compositional property\nof relationships. The bipartite graph construction consists of\ntwo steps: a) node (entity and predicate) generation , and b)\ndirected edge connection .\nIn the node generation step, we extract the entity nodes\nand predicate nodes from the image with an entity node\ngenerator and a predicate node generator , respectively. The\npredicate node generator augments the predicate proposals\nwith entity information based on three parallel sub-decoders.In the directed edge connection step, we design a graph\nassembling module to generate the bipartite scene graph\nfrom the entity and predicate proposals. An overview of\nour method is illustrated in Fig. 2 and we will start with a\ndetailed description of our model architecture below.\n4. Our Approach\nOur model consists of four main submodules: (1) a back-\nbone network for generating feature representation of the\nscene (Sec. 4.1); (2) a transformer-based entity node gener-\nator for predicting entity proposals (Sec. 4.1); (3) a structural\npredicate node generator for decoding predicate nodes\n(Sec. 4.2); (4) a bipartite graph assembling module for\nconstructing \ufb01nal bipartite graph via connecting entity nodes\nand entity-aware predicate nodes (Sec. 4.3). The model\nlearning and inference are detailed in Sec. 4.4.\n4.1. Backbone and Entity Node Generator\nWe adopt a ResNet as the backbone network, which \ufb01rst\nproduces a convolutional feature representation for the sub-\nsequent modules. Motivated by the Transformer-based de-\ntector, DETR [2], we then use a multi-layer Transformer\nencoder to augment the convolutional features. The result-\ning CNN+transformer feature is denoted as Z\u2208Rw\u00d7h\u00d7d,\nwherew,h,d are the width, height, and channel of the fea-\nture map, respectively.\nFor the entity node generator, we adopt the decoder of\nDETR to produce Neentity nodes from a set of learnable\nentity queries. Formally, we de\ufb01ne the entity decoder as\na mapping function Fe, which takes initial entity query\nQe\u2208RNe\u00d7dand the feature map Zas inputs, and out-\nputs the entity locations Be\u2208RNe\u00d74and class scores\nPe\u2208RNe\u00d7(Ce+1), along with their associated feature repre-\nsentations He\u2208RNe\u00d7das follows,\nBe,Pe,He=Fe(Z,Qe) (1)\nwhere Be={b1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,bNe},b= (xc,yc,wb,hb),xc,yc\nare the normalized center coordinates of the instance, wb,hb\nare the normalized width and height of each entity box.\n4.2. Predicate Node Generator\nOur predicate node generator aims to generate an entity-\naware predicate representation by incorporating relevant en-\ntity proposal information into each predicate node. Such a\ndesign enables us to encode potential associations between\neach predicate and its subject/object entities, which can fa-\ncilitate predicting the graph edges and lead to ef\ufb01cient gen-\neration of the visual relation triplets.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the predicate node generator is com-\nposed of three components: (1) a predicate query initializa-\ntion module for initializing the entity-aware predicate query\n(in Sec. 4.2.2), (2) a predicate encoder for image feature\nextraction (in Sec. 4.2.1), and (3) a structural predicate\ndecoder for decoding a set of entity-aware predicate nodes.\n(in Sec. 4.2.3).\nEntity Node\nGenerator\nCNN\nFeature\nTransformer\nEncoderPredicate Node\nGeneratorEntity Queries\nEntity Feature\nPredicate QueriesEntity Nodes\nEntity -aware\nPredicate NodesPositional\nEncodingGraph\nAssemblingFeature Extraction Node Generation Graph Construction\nEntity Location\nEntity FeaturePredicate Queries\nPredicate Query\nInitialization\nPredicate\nSub-decoder\nPredicate -Indicator\nFusion\nEntity -aware Predicate NodesEntity\nFeatureEncoder Feature\n\u00d7\ud835\udc3fPredicate Node Generator\nPredicate \nEncoder\nIndicator\nSub-decoder\nStructural\nPredicate DecoderFigure 2. An illustration of overall pipeline of our SGTR model. Left) We use a CNN backbone together with a transformer encoder for\nimage feature extraction. The entity and predicate node generators are introduced to produce the entity node and entity-aware predicate node.\nA graph assembling mechanism is developed to construct the \ufb01nal bipartite scene graph. Right) The predicate node generator consists of\nthree parts: a)predicate query initialization, b)a predicate encoder, and c)a structural predicate decoder, which is designed to generate\nentity-aware predicate nodes.\n4.2.1 Predicate Encoder\nBased on the CNN+transformer features Z, we introduce a\nlightweight predicate encoder to extract predicate-speci\ufb01c\nimage features. Our predicate encoder, which has a similar\nstructure to the backbone Transformer encoder, employs a\nform of multi-layer multi-head self-attention via the skip-\nconnected feed-forward network. The resulting predicate-\nspeci\ufb01c feature is denoted as Zp\u2208Rw\u00d7h\u00d7d.\n4.2.2 Predicate Query Initialization\nA simple strategy for initializing the predicate queries is to\nadopt a set of learnable vectors as in the DETR [2]. However,\nsuch a holistic vector-based query design ignores not only\nthecompositional property of the visual relationships but\nalso the entity candidate information. The resulting represen-\ntations are not expressive enough for capturing the structured\nand diverse visual relationships.\nTo cope with this challenge, we introduce a com-\npositional query representation that decouples predicate\nqueries, denoted as Qe\np\u2208RNr\u00d73d, into three compo-\nnents{Qis;Qio;Qp}, where subject/object entity indica-\ntorQis,Qio\u2208RNr\u00d7d3and predicate representation\nQp\u2208RNr\u00d7d. Concretely, we generate the predicate query\nQe\npin an entity-aware and scene-adaptive manner using a\nset of initial predicate queries Qinit\u2208RNr\u00d7dand enti-\nties representation Be,He. To achieve this, we \ufb01rst build\na geometric-aware entity representation as in [49], which\nde\ufb01nes a set of key and value vectors \u2208RNe\u00d7das follows:\nKinit=Vinit= (He+Ge),Ge=ReLU (BeWg),(2)\nwhere Ge\u2208RNe\u00d7dis a learnable geometric embedding\n3The subscripts \u2019s\u2019, \u2019o\u2019 stand for the subject and object entity, respec-\ntively.of entity proposals, Wg\u2208R4\u00d7dis a transformation from\nbounding box locations to the embedding space.\nGiven the augmented entity representations, we then com-\npute the predicate queries Qe\npusing a multi-head cross-\nattention operation on the initial predicate queries Qinitand\nKinit. For clarity, we use A(q,k,v ) =FFN(MHA (q,k,v ))\nto denote the multi-head attention operation. As such,\nwe have Qe\np=A(Qinit,Kinit,Vinit)We, where We\u2208\nRd\u00d73d= [Wis\ne,Wio\ne,Wp\ne]are the transformation matrices\nfor the three sub-queries Qis,Qio,Qp, respectively. In this\nway, we obtain a structural query that incorporates the en-\ntity information into the predicate query. The sub-queries\nQis,Qioare referred to as entity indicators as they will be\nused to capture predicate-entity associations below.\n4.2.3 Structural Predicate Node Decoder\nGiven the predicate query Qe\nq, we now develop a structural\npredicate node decoder that leverages the compositional\nproperty and decodes all the predicate triplets from the en-\ntity/predicate feature maps.\nOur structural decoder consists of three modules: a) pred-\nicate sub-decoder ; b)entity indicator sub-decoders ; c)pred-\nicate indicator fusion . The two types of decoders take the\nencoder feature map Zpand entity features He, respectively\nand update the three components of the predicate query\nindependently. Based on the updated predicate query com-\nponents, the predicate-indicator fusion re\ufb01nes the entire\npredicate queries, aiming to improve the entity-predicate\nassociation within each compositional query.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we adopt the standard transformer decoder\nstructure below. For notation clarity, we focus on a single de-\ncoder layer and omit layer number lwithin each sub-decoder,\nas well as the notation of the self-attention operation.\nPredicate Sub-decoder . The predicate sub-decoder is de-\nsigned to re\ufb01ne the predicate representation from the im-\nage feature map Zp, which utilizes the spatial context in\nthe image for updating predicate representation. We imple-\nment this decoding process using the cross-attention mecha-\nnism:/tildewideQp=A(q=Qp,k=Zp,v=Zp), where/tildewideQpis the\nupdated predicate representation.\nEntity Indicator Sub-Decoders. The entity indicator sub-\ndecoders re\ufb01ne the entity indicators associated with the pred-\nicate queries. Instead of relying on image features, we\nleverage more accurate entity features in the given scene.\nSpeci\ufb01cally, we perform cross-attention operation between\nentity indicators Qis,Qioand entity proposal features He\nfrom the entity node generator, aiming to enhance the repre-\nsentation of the entity associations.We denote the updated\nrepresentation of the entities indicator as /tildewideQis,/tildewideQio, which\nare generated with standard cross-attention operation:\n/tildewideQis=A(Qis,He,He),/tildewideQio=A(Qio,He,He)(3)\nPredicate-Indicator Fusion To encode the contextual\nrelation between each predicate query and its entity in-\ndicators, we perform a predicate-indicator fusion to cal-\nibrate the features of three components in the query.\nWe explicitly fuse the current l-th decoder layer outputs\n/tildewideQl\np,/tildewideQl\nis,/tildewideQl\nioto update each component of as the query for\nnext layer Ql+1\np,Ql+1\nis,Ql+1\nio. Speci\ufb01cally, we adopt fully\nconnected layers for updating the predicate by fusing entity\nindicator representations as Eq. 4:\nQl+1\np=/parenleftBig\n/tildewideQl\np+/parenleftBig\n/tildewideQl\nis+/tildewideQl\nio/parenrightBig\n\u00b7Wi/parenrightBig\n\u00b7Wp (4)\nwhere Wi,Wp\u2208Rd\u00d7dare the transformation parameters\nfor update. For the entity indicators, we simply adopt the\nprevious layer output as input: Ql+1\nis=/tildewideQl\nis,Ql+1\nio=/tildewideQl\nio.\nBased on the re\ufb01ned predicate queries, we are able to gen-\nerate the geometric and semantic predictions of the predicate\nnode, as well as the location and category of its associated\nentity indicator as follows,\nPp=Softmax (/tildewideQp\u00b7Wp\ncls)\u2208RNr\u00d7(Cp+1), (5)\nBp=\u03c3(/tildewideQp\u00b7Wp\nreg) ={(xs\nc,ys\nc,xo\nc,yo\nc)}\u2208RNr\u00d74(6)\nwhere Ppare the class predictions of predicates, and Bp=\n{(xs\nc,ys\nc,xo\nc,yo\nc)}are the box center coordinates of its sub-\nject and object entities. The entity indicators are also trans-\nlated as location prediction of entities Bs,Bo\u2208RNr\u00d74\nand their classi\ufb01cation predictions Ps,Po\u2208RNr\u00d7(Ce+1),\nwhich are similar to the entity generator.\nOverall, each predicate decoder layer produces the loca-\ntions and classi\ufb01cations for all the entity-aware predicate\nqueries. Using the multi-layer structure, the predicate de-\ncoder is able to gradually improve the quality of predicate\nand entity association.\nDistance \nFunction1\n2\n3\n4\n5a 1\n2\n3\n4\n5b\nc\nd3\n54\n1c\ndbSubject\nCorrespondenceObject\nCorrespondence\nEntity Nodes\nEntity -aware\nPredicate NodesScene GraphBipartite Graph AssemblingFigure 3. The illustration of Bipartite Graph Assembling.\n4.3. Bipartite Graph Assembling\nIn our formulation, we convert the original scene graph\ninto a bipartite graph structure which consists of Neentity\nnodes andNrpredicate nodes, as shown in Fig. 3. The\nmain goal of the graph assembling is to link the entity-aware\npredicate nodes to the proper entity node.\nTo achieve this, we need to obtain the adjacency matrix\nbetween the Neentity nodes and Nrpredicate nodes, which\ncan be encoded into a correspondence matrix M\u2208RNr\u00d7Ne.\nConcretely, we de\ufb01ne the correspondence matrix by the dis-\ntance between the entity indicators of predicate nodes and\nthe entity nodes. Taking the subject entity indicator as ex-\nample, we have: Ms=dloc(Bs,Be)\u00b7dcls(Ps,Pe), where\ndloc(\u00b7)anddcls(\u00b7)are the distance function to measure the\nmatching quality from different dimensions4. The correspon-\ndence matrix of object entity Mo\u2208RNr\u00d7Neis obtained\nfollowing the same strategy. The empirical analysis of dif-\nferent distance metrics will be discussed in the experiment\nsection. Based on the correspondence matrix, we keep the\ntop-Klinks according to the matching scores as the edge\nlinks for each predicate node:\nRs=Ftop(Ms,K)\u2208RNr\u00d7K(7)\nRo=Ftop(Mo,K)\u2208RNr\u00d7K(8)\nwhereFtopis the top-Kindex selection operation, Rsand\nRoare the index matrix of entities kept for each triplet from\nthe two relationship roles of subject and object, respectively.\nUsing the index matrix RsandRo, we are able\nto generate the \ufb01nal relationship triplets as T=\n{(bs\ne,ps\ne,bo\ne,po\ne,pp,bp)}. Here bs\ne,bo\ne\u2208R1\u00d74and\nps\ne,po\ne\u2208R1\u00d7(Ce+1)are bounding boxes and class pre-\ndictions of its subject and object entity respectively, pp\u2208\nR1\u00d7(Cp+1)is the class prediction of each predicate Pp, and\nbp\u2208Bpare the centers of the predicate\u2019s entities. In the\nend, the graph assembling module generates the \ufb01nal scene\ngraph as the output of our SGTR model.\n4e.g., cosine distance between the classi\ufb01cation distribution, GIOU and\nL1 distance between the bounding box predictions, detailed illustration is\npresented in the supplementary.\n4.4. Learning and Inference\nLearning To train our SGTR model, we design a multi-task\nloss that consists of two components, including Lencfor\nthe entity generator and Lprefor predicate generator. The\noverall loss function is formulated as:\nL=Lenc+Lpre,Lpre=Lpre\ni+Lpre\np (9)\nAs we adopt a DETR-like detector, the Lencfollows a similar\nform as [2], and the detailed loss equation is reported in the\nsupplementary material. We mainly focus on Lprein the\nremaining parts of this section. To calculate the loss for the\npredicate node generator, we \ufb01rst obtain the matching matrix\nbetween the prediction and the ground truth by adopting the\nHungarian matching algorithm [17]. We then convert the\nground-truth of the visual relationships into a set of triplet\nrepresentations in as similar form as T, denoted asTgt. The\ncost of the set matching is de\ufb01ned as:\nC=\u03bbpCp+\u03bbeCe (10)\nThe two components in the total cost correspond to the costs\nof predicate and subject/object entity, respectively5. The\nmatching index Itribetween triplet predictions and ground\ntruths is produced by: Itri=argminT,TgtC, which is used\nfor following loss calculation of predicate node generator.\nThe two terms of Lpre, that is,Lpre\ni,Lpre\np, are used\nto supervise two types of sub-decoder in predicate node\ngenerator. For the entity indicator sub-decoder, we have\nLpre\ni=Li\nbox+Li\ncls, whereLi\nboxandLi\nclsare the local-\nization loss (L1 and GIOU loss) and cross-entropy loss for\nentities indicator Ps,Bs,Po,Bo. Similarly, for the predi-\ncate sub-decoder, we have Lpre\np=Lp\nent+Lp\ncls. TheLp\nentis\nthe L1 loss of the location of predicate\u2019s associated entities\nBp. TheLp\nclsis the cross entropy of predicate category Pp.\nInference During model inference, we generate K\u00b7Nr\nvisual relationship predictions after the assembling stage.\nWe further remove the invalid self-connection edges during\ninference. We adopt a post-processing operation to \ufb01lter out\nthe self-connected triplets (subject and object entities are\nidentical). Then, we rank the remaining predictions by the\ntriplet scoreStand take the top Nrelationship triplet as \ufb01nal\noutputs. We denote the output as St={(st\ns\u00b7st\no\u00b7st\np)}, where\nst\ns,st\noandst\npare the classi\ufb01cation probability of subject\nentity, object entity and predicate, respectively.\n5. Experiments\n5.1. Experiments Con\ufb01guration\nWe evaluate our methods on Openimage V6 datasets [18]\nand Visual Genome [16]. We mainly adopt the data splits\nand evaluation metrics from the previous work [19, 42, 55].\nFor the Openimage benchmark, the weighted evaluation\n5We utilize the location and classi\ufb01cation predictions to calculate cost\nfor each component.

The predicate node generator uses 3 layers of\ntransformer encoder for predicate encoders and 6 layers of\ntransformer decoder for predicate and entity indicator sub-\ndecoders, whose hidden dimensions dis 256. Our predicate\ndecoder uses Nr=150 queries. We set K=40 in training and\nK=3 during test for graph assembling module. For more\nimplementation details please refer to the supplementary.\n5.2. Ablation Study\nModel Components As shown in Tab. 1, we ablate each\nmodule to demonstrate the effectiveness of our design on the\nvalidation set of Visual Genome.\n\u2022We \ufb01nd that using the holistic query for predicate rather\nthan the proposed structural form decreases the performance\nby a margin of R@100 and mR@100 at 1.9and1.4in line-2.\n\u2022Adopting the shared cross-attention between the image fea-\ntures and predicate/entity indicator instead of the structural\npredicate decoder leads to the sub-optimal performance as\nreported in line-3\n\u2022We further remove both entity indicators and directly de-\ncode the predicate node from the image feature. The result\nis reported in line-4, which decreases the performance by a\nmargin of 4.2and2.5on R@100 and mR@100.\n\u2022We also investigate the graph assembling mechanism by\ndirectly adopting the prediction of entity indicators as entity\nnodes for relationship prediction. The poor results shown in\nline-5 demonstrate that the model struggles to tackle such\ncomplex multi-tasks within a single structure, while pro-\nposed entity-prediction association modeling and graph as-\nsembling reduce the dif\ufb01culty of optimization.\nGraph Assembling Design We further investigate the ef-\nfectiveness of our graph assembling design.

In AS-Net [3], the\ngrouping is conducted based on the distance between en-\ntity bounding box and entity center predicted by interac-\ntion branch, which lacks the entity semantic information.\nThe HOTR [13] introduces a cosine similarity measurement\nbetween the predicate and entity in feature space. We im-\nplement this form for calculation the distance between the\nentity indicator /tildewideQis,/tildewideQioand entity nodes He. Compared\nwith location-only [3] similarity and feature-based [13] sim-\nilarity, our proposed assembling mechanism, taking both\nsemantic and spatial information into the similarity measure-\nment, is preferable. We also empirically observe that the\nfeature-based [13] similarity design has a slower and more\nunstable convergence process.\nModel Size To investigate the model complexity of the struc-\ntural predicate node decoder, we incrementally vary the num-\nber of layers Lin the predicate and entity indicator decoder.\nThe quantitative results are shown in Tab. 2. The results\nindicate that our model achieves the best performance while\nL= 6. We observe that the performance improvement is\nconsiderable when increasing the number of decoder layers\nfrom 3 to 6, and performance will be saturated when L= 12 .\nEntity Detector As we adopt different entity detectors com-\npared to previous two-stage designs, we conduct experiments\nto analyze the in\ufb02uence of detectors on the SGTR. The de-\ntailed results are presented in the supplementary.\n5.3. Comparisons with State-of-the-Art Methods\nWe conduct experiments on Openimage-V6 benchmark\nand VG dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our de-\nsign. We compare our method with several state-of-the-art\ntwo-stage( e.g., VCTree-PCPL, VCTree-DLFE, BGNN [19],\nVCTree-TDE, DT2-ACBS [5]) and one-stage methods( e.g.\nAS-Net, HOTR, FCSGG) on Visual Genome dataset.

Furthermore, since FCSGG [24] is the only pub-\nlished one-stage method for SGG, we reproduce the result\nof several strong one-stage HOI methods with similar entity-\npredicate pairing mechanisms (AS-Net [3], HOTR [13])\nusing their released code for a more comprehensive compar-\nison.\nOpenImage V6 The performance on the OpenImage V6\ndataset is reported in Tab. 4. We re-implement the SOTA\none-stage and two-stage methods with the same ResNet-101\nbackbone. Our method outperforms the two-stage SOTA\nmethod BGNN with an improvement of 2.28. Speci\ufb01cally,\nour design has a signi\ufb01cant improvement on weighted mAP\nmetrics of relationship detection ( wmAP rel) and phrase de-\ntection ( wmAP phr) sub-tasks of 5.83 and7.36 respectively,\nwhich indicates that leveraging the compositional property\nof the visual relationship is bene\ufb01cial for the SGG task.\nVisual Genome As shown in Tab. 5, with the same ResNet-\n101 backbone, we compare our method with the two-stage\nmethod BGNN [19], and the one-stage methods HOTR [13],\nAS-Net [3]. It shows that our method outperforms HOTR\nwith a signi\ufb01cant margin of 4.9and3.2on mRecall@100.\nFurthermore, our method achieves considerable improve-\nment when compared with the two-stage methods, and the\ndetailed performance is presented in the supplementary.\n\u2022Bene\ufb01tting from the sparse proposal set, SGTR has a\nmore balanced foreground/background proposal distribution\nthan the traditional two-stage design, where there exists a\nlarge number of negative samples due to exhausted entity\npairing. Thus, when equipped with the same backbone and\nlearning strategy as before, our method achieves competitive\nperformance in mean recall. We also list several newly\nproposed works, which develops various training strategies\nfor long-tailed recognition. Our method achieves higher\nmR@100 performance with less overall performance drop\nwhen using the resampling strategy proposed in [19].

The main reason is that the DETR detector per-\nforms weaker on small entities than the traditional Faster-\nRCNN. Since the visual genome has a large proportion of\nrelationships involving small objects, our method performs\nsub-optimal in recognizing those relationships. The detailed\nlimitation analysis is presented in the supplementary.\n\u2022We compare the ef\ufb01ciency of SGTR with previous meth-\nods according to the inference time (seconds/image) on the\nNVIDIA GeForce Titan XP GPU with a batch size of 1 and\nan input size of 600 x 1000. Our design obtains compara-\nble inference time as the one-stage methods using the same\nbackbone, which demonstrates the ef\ufb01ciency of our method.\n5.4. Qualitative Results\nAs shown in Fig. 4, we visualize the attention weight of\nthe predicates sub-decoder and entity sub-decoder on images\nfrom the validation set of the Visual Genome dataset. By\ncomparing the heatmaps in Fig. 4 (a) and Fig. 4 (b), we note\nthat for the same triplet prediction, the predicate sub-decoder\nfocuses more on the contextual regions around the entities of\ntriplets while the entity sub-decoders put more attention on\nthe entity regions. Therefore, our design allows the model\nto learn the compositional property of visual relationships\nmore effectively, which improves prediction accuracy. More\nvisualization results are reported in the supplementary (in-\ncluding analysis of graph assembling, comparison between\ntwo-stage methods, etc.).\n6.

The visualization on attention heatmap of structural\npredicate decoder. The predicate sub-decoder focus on contextual\nrepresentation around the entities of triplets. Entity indicator sub-\ndecoders focus on relationship-based entity regions.\nIn comparison to the prior approaches, our major contribu-\ntion consists of two components: We formulate the SGG as\na bipartite graph construction with three steps: entity and\npredicate nodes generation and directed edge connection.\nWe develop the entity-aware representation for modeling the\npredicate nodes, which is integrated with the entity indica-\ntors by the structural predicate node decoder. Finally, the\nscene graph is constructed by the graph assembling module\nin an end-to-end manner. Extensive experimental results\nshow that our SGTR outperforms or is competitive with pre-\nvious state-of-the-art methods on the Visual Genome and\nOpenimage V6 datasets.\nPotential Negative Societal Impact One possible negative\nimpact is that SGG may serve as a base module for surveil-\nlance abuse and collecting private information.\nReferences\n[1]Sherif Abdelkarim, Aniket Agarwal, Panos Achlioptas, Jun\nChen, Jiaji Huang, Boyang Li, Kenneth Church, and Mo-\nhamed Elhoseiny.

Left) The statistics of entity sizes in visual relationship\nbased on the training set of Visual Genome. Right) The perfor-\nmance (Recall@100) of relationship detection with respect to dif-\nferent entity sizes. We de\ufb01ne an entity as \"small\" if the area of its\nbox is smaller than 64 \u00d764 pixels.\nFirst, we analyze why our SGTR achieves lower overall\nrecall performance than the traditional two-stage design. One\npotential reason is that the SGTR uses an ResNet-101 back-\nbone (like DETR) for entity detection rather than the Faster-\nRCNN with an ResNet-101 FPN backbone. According tothe experimental results of DETR [ ?], using the ResNet-101\nbackbone achieves lower performance than Faster-RCNN\nwith the ResNet-101 FPN on small objects (21.9 versus 27.2\nAPs on the COCO dataset).\nTo con\ufb01rm that, we further study how small entities in-\n\ufb02uence visual relationship detection. We categorize the rela-\ntionship instances in the Visual Genome dataset into three\ndisjoint sets according to their entity sizes, and plot the statis-\ntics of the sets in Fig. 1. The result shows that more than\nhalf of the relationships consist of small entities. We also\ncompare the performance of our method (R@100) on three\nrelationship sub-sets with the two-stage approach BGNN [ ?]\nand report the performance in Fig. 1. The BGNN with the\ntwo-stage design outperforms the SGTR on the relationships\nwith small entities by a large margin due to the inherent\nlimitation of DETR on small entity detection.\nThe issue of recognizing small objects ef\ufb01ciently and\neffectively is still under active study [ ?,?,?,?]. With more\nsophisticated transformer-based detectors, the overall recall\nof our method can be further improved.\n1.2. In\ufb02uence of Object Detector\nWe \ufb01rst compare the performances of DETR and faster\nRCNN on the head (H), body (B) and tail (T) predicates\nin Tab.1, which also groups the detector results into H/B/T\nobject classes. The result indicates that DETR achieves a\nsimilar detection performance as Faster R-CNN for tail pred-\nicates. Moreover, we equip BGNN with DETR and as shown\nin Tab.2, its performance is on par with its Faster R-CNN\ncounterparts. Finally, we also combine DETR optimized in\nSGTR with a \ufb01netuned BGNN. The results in Tab.2 clearly\nshow the SGTR outperforms this baseline, demonstrating\nthe bene\ufb01t of our design.\nRecall (S-DETR / RCNN)\nRel Head Rel Body Rel Tail\nEnt Head 49.3 / 50.5 49.2 / 50.3 59.7 / 57.1\nEnt Body 39.5 / 41.3 46.2 / 43.1 44.9 / 43.7\nEnt Tail 44.3 / 41.7 47.6 / 44.5 45.1 / 38.5\nTable 1.

To achieve better performance on the SGG task, we\nfurther apply several recent long-tail learning strategies in\nour model. [ ?,?,?], and report the performance in Tab. 3. We\n\ufb01nd that there exists a trade-off between overall and mean\nrecall in the comprehensive experimental results. The ad-\nvanced learning strategies enable our model to either achieve\na higher mean recall or maintain a better trade-off between\noverall and mean recall.\n\u2022We adopt the retraining strategy, DisAlign [ ?], to adjust the\npredicate prediction logits via loss re-weighting with respectto the instance distribution of relationships. This method\nimproves the performance trade-off between mR@100 and\nR@100 by increasing mean recall by 1.6and achieving only\na 0.4 performance drop on R@100.\n\u2022Moreover, we re-implement the alternative class-balanced\nretraining strategy (ACBS) [ ?], which achieves the SOTA on\nmean recall with the two-stage SGG model. The ACBS re-\ntrains both entity and predicate classi\ufb01ers using class-based\nsampling. This method achieves high mean recall perfor-\nmance while sacri\ufb01cing the performance of the overall per-\nformance.\n\u2022Finally, we apply the decoupled retraining strategy [ ?]\non the predicate classi\ufb01er of SGTR. We observe that using\nadditional balanced-sampling retraining results in 6.4perfor-\nmance gain on mR@100 with a 3.6 drop on R@100. This\nstrategy outperforms the aforementioned methods in terms\nof mean recall performance.\nWe also observe that using the re-balance idea on en-\ntity classi\ufb01er does not bring too much performance bene\ufb01t.\nTo investigate this phenomenon, we report the relationship\nbetween the per-class instance frequency and the perfor-\nmance of entity detection in Fig. 2. Despite the fact that the\ndistribution of entity instances obeys the long-tail distribu-\ntion, SGTR\u2019s entity detection performance is quite balanced,\nwhich means that the transformer-based detector is capable\nof tackling the data imbalanced scenario to some degree, and\nthe additional re-balancing strategy is unnecessary.\n1.4. Zero-shot Recall\nWe compare our method with VCTree-TDE in Tab.4,\nachieving a gain of 2.6 on zR@100. The result shows the\ngeneralization capability of SGTR to unseen relationships.\nWe greatly appreciate R2\u2019s suggestions and will leave the\nfurther exploration to future work.\nzR BGNN\u2020BGNN\u2020\nDDT2-ACBS\u2020VCTree-TDE SGTR\n@50 0.4 0.5 0.3 2.6 2.4\n@100 0.9 0.7 0.5 3.2 5.8\nTable 4.

Qualitative Results\nVisualization of Entity Indicator and Entity Node To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed graph assem-\nbling mechanism, we visualize predictions of entity indica-\ntors of our predicate representation and entity nodes after the\ngraph assembling. As shown in Fig. 3, the entity indicator\nonly provides a rough localization and classi\ufb01cation of en-\ntities rather than precise bounding boxes. This information\ncan be re\ufb01ned into more accurate entity results with graph\nassembling, which signi\ufb01cantly improves the quality of the\ngenerated scene graph.\nPrediction Comparision between Different Design We\ncompare different method ( e.g., BGNN [ ?]) by visualizing\nthe relationship predictions. In Fig. 4, we mark the different\nrelationship predictions between BGNN and SGTR with redcolor. It shows that SGTR retrieves more relationships of\nless frequent semantic categories than BGNN.\n2. Implementation Details\nWe implement our method based on the PyTorch 1.8 [ ?]\nand cvpods [ ?]. Our training process consists of two phases:\n1) entity detector pre-training and2) SGTR joint training .\nEntity Detector Pre-training Phase: We follow the\nDETR training con\ufb01guration to learn the entity detector on\nVisual Genome and Openimage datasets. We train the entity\ndetector with the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of\n1e-5, a batch size of 16, and the model takes 100 epochs for\nconvergence on 4 TITAN V GPUs. We use the same scale\naugmentation with DETR, resizing the input images such\nthat the shortest side is at least 480 and at most 600 pixels,\nwhile the longest is at most 1000. The hyper-parameters of\nTransformer ( e.g., number of attention heads, drop-out rate)\nare also kept the same with the DETR.\nJoint Learning Phase: In the joint training phase, we\nadopt the same optimizer, learning rate, and batch size con-\n\ufb01guration as in the entity detector pre-training stage. In\ncontrast with the two-stage SGG model, we re\ufb01ne the param-\neters of the detector in the joint learning rather than freezing\nthe detector. We empirically observe that this re\ufb01nement fur-\nther improves the performance of entity detection. We train\nthe SGTR for the Visual Genome dataset for 8.39e4 itera-\ntions without learning rate decay by using an early-stopping\nstrategy. For the Openimage dataset, we train the model with\n1.5e5 iterations, and the learning rate is decreased by 0.1x\nafter 1e5 iterations.\nWe re-implement the previous two-stage methods\n(BGNN [ ?] and RelDN [ ?]) in our codebase by using the\nsame con\ufb01guration as the released codes. For fair compra-\nsion, we replace the ResNeXt-101 FPN backbone with the\nResNet-101 backbone to learn the model. We also apply the\none-stage HOI works (AS-Net [ ?] and HOTR [ ?]) on the\nSGG. We use the hyper-parameters of the models reported\nby the authors. All experiments are conducted by training\nthe model until convergence.\n3. Correspondence Matrix for Assembling\nFor clarity, we will use the correspondence matrix be-\ntween the subject entity and predicate Msto introduce the\ndetails. The correspondence matrix is determined by the\ndistance function, which takes the semantic outputs ( e.g.\nbounding boxes B, classi\ufb01cation Pof the entity detector\nand entity indicator of the predicate structural decoder) as\ninput. Speci\ufb01cally, the distance function consists of two\nparts: spatial matching distance dloc\u2208RNr\u00d7Neand cate-\ngory matching distance dcls\u2208RNr\u00d7Ne, as shown in Eq. 1\nMs=dloc(Bs,Be)\u00b7dcls(Ps,Pe) (1)\nEach element in the correspondence matrix Msis calcu-\nlated by pairing the Nrpredicate predictions with Neentity\npredictions, as shown in the following equations:\nMs\ni,j=dloc(Bs(i),Be(j))\u00b7dcls(Ps(i),Pe(j)) (2)\n=dloc(bs,i,be,j)\u00b7dcls(ps,i,pe,j) (3)\nwherei\u2208[0,Ne],j\u2208[0,Nr]for enumerating each pair\nbetween the predicate proposal and entity set.\nThen we present the two components of the distance\nfunction,dlocanddcls. Speci\ufb01cally, the dlocconsists of the\ndgiou\u2208RNr\u00d7Neanddcenter\u2208RNr\u00d7Ne, as show in Eq. 4.\ndloc(bs,be) =dgiou(bs,be)\ndcenter (bs,be)(4)Concretely, the dgiouis the clipped GIOU of the entity and\nthe indicator\u2019s bounding boxes, and dcenter is the L1 dis-\ntance between the bounding boxes\u2019 centers in Eq. 5, 6. The\ncenter points-based matching has also been adopted in HOI\nmethods [ ?,?,?].\ndgiou(bs,be) = max(min( GIOU (bs,be),0),1) (5)\ndcenter (bs,be) =||[xc,yc]s\ni\u2212[xe,ye]e\ni||1 (6)\nHere [xs,ys]sand[xe,ye]eare the normalized center coordi-\nnates of the bounding box in bsandberespectively. For the\ndcls, we use the cosine distance to calculate the similarity of\nthe classi\ufb01cation distribution between two entity predictions,\nas shown in following equation:\ndcls(ps,pe) =ps\u00b7p/intercal\ne\n||ps||\u00b7||pe||(7)\n4. Matching Cost and Loss Function\n4.1. Triplets Matching Cost\nWe use the set-matching strategy to supervise the relation-\nship predictionsT={(bs\ne,ps\ne,bo\ne,po\ne,pp,bp)}. To obtain\nthe matches, we need to calculate and minimize the matching\ncostC\u2208RNr\u00d7Ngtbetween the Nrrelationship predictions\nand theNgtGT relationships. Concretely, the matching cost\nCincludes two parts: the predicate cost Cpand the entity\ncostCe, as:\nC=\u03bbpCp+\u03bbeCe (8)\nwhere\u03bbp,\u03bbeis the coef\ufb01cients of two cost terms.\nThe predicate cost, Cp(i,j)between the i-th predicate\nprediction and the j-th ground-truth relationship is com-\nputed according to the predicate classi\ufb01cation distribution\nand location prediction in Eq. 9:\nCp(i,j) = exp/parenleftbig\n\u2212pgt\np,j\u00b7p/intercal\np,i/parenrightbig\n+/bardblbp,i\u2212bgt\np,j/bardbl1(9)\nwhere pp,i\u2208R1\u00d7Cpis thei-thPp, andpgt\np,j\u2208R1\u00d7Cpis the\none-hot predicate label of the j-th ground truth relationship.\nSimilarly, bp,i\u2208R1\u00d74andbgt\np,j\u2208R1\u00d74are the center coor-\ndinates of the entity pair from the i-th relationship prediction\nand thej-th ground truth relationship, respectively.\nThe entity costCe(i,j)between the i-th predicted rela-\ntionship and j-th ground-truth relationship is given by:\nCe(i,j) =wgiou\u00b7/productdisplay\n\u22c6={s,o}exp/parenleftbig\n\u2212dgiou(b\u22c6\ne,i,b\u22c6\ngt,j)/parenrightbig\n(10)\n+wl1\u00b7/summationdisplay\n\u22c6={s,o}||b\u22c6\ne,i\u2212b\u22c6\ngt,j||1 (11)\n+wcls\u00b7/productdisplay\n\u22c6={s,o}exp/parenleftBig\n\u2212p(\u22c6,gt)\ne,j\u00b7p\u22c6\ne,i/intercal/parenrightBig\n(12)\nwhere the b\u22c6\ne,iandp\u22c6\ne,iare thei-th subject/object entity\nbox and category distribution of relationship Tafter graph\nassembling, respectively. The b\u22c6\ngt,jandp(\u22c6,gt)\ne,j is the sub-\nject/object bounding boxes and one-hot entity category label\nfromj-th ground truth relationships.\n4.2. Loss Calculation\nOur total lossLis composed of entity detector loss Lenc\nand predicate node generator loss Lpre:\nL=Lenc+Lpre(13)\nThe entity detector loss Lencis calculated independently by\nfollowing the same design in DETR [ ?].\nThe loss of predicate node generator Lpreis determined\nby the prediction and ground-the relationships according to\nthe matching index Itri\u2208NNgt. TheItristores the index of\nmatched predictions for each GT relationship. Speci\ufb01cally,\nthe predicate node generator loss consists of entity indicator\nlossLpre\niand predicate sub-decoder loss Lpre\np:\nLpre=Lpre\ni+Lpre\np (14)\nFor loss of predicate sub-decoder loss Lpre\np, we have:\nLpre\np=Ngt/summationdisplay\ni/parenleftbig\n/bardblbp,Itri(i)\u2212bgt\np,i/bardbl1+CE/parenleftbig\npp,Itri(i),pgt\np,i/parenrightbig/parenrightbig\n(15)\nwhere bgt\np,iandbp,Itri(i)is the entity center coordinates\nof the GT relationship and prediction, respectively. The\nCEdenotes the cross entropy loss between the predicate\nclassi\ufb01cation bp,Itri(i)and the GT predicate category one-\nhot vector pgt\np,i.\nFor the entity indicator loss Lpre\ni:\nLpre\ni=/summationdisplay\n\u22c6={s,o}/parenleftbig\nL\u22c6\nent_loc+L\u22c6\nent_cls/parenrightbig\n(16)\nwhere\u22c6={s,o}indicates the subject/object role of an\nentity in relationships. The indicator loss is composed of\ntwo factors,L\u22c6\nent_locandL\u22c6\nent_cls, for two types of semantic\nrepresentation: bounding boxes bs,boand classi\ufb01cation\nps,po.\nL\u22c6\nent_loc=Ngt/summationdisplay\ni/parenleftbig\n/bardblb\u22c6,Itri(i)\u2212bgt\n\u22c6,i/bardbl1 (17)\n+1\u2212GIOU/parenleftbig\nb\u22c6,Itri(i),bgt\n\u22c6,i/parenrightbig/parenrightbig\n(18)\nL\u22c6\nent_cls=Ngt/summationdisplay\niCE/parenleftbig\np\u22c6,Itri(i),pgt\n\u22c6,i/parenrightbig\n(19)TheL\u22c6\nent_locis computed by the L1distance and GIoU loss\nbetween the bounding box outputs b\u22c6,Itri(i)and ground-\ntruth entity boxes bgt\n\u22c6,i. TheL\u22c6\nent_clsis calculated from the\ncross entropy loss of classi\ufb01cation prediction p\u22c6,Itri(i)ac-\ncording to ground-truth entities\u2019category pgt\n\u22c6,i.\n5. Social Impacts\nOur method has no direct potential negative impact, one\npossible negative impact is that SGG may serve as a base\nmodule for surveillance abuse."
