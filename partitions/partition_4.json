Existing automatic evaluation metrics\nfor summarization are largely insensitive to\nsuch errors. We propose an automatic evalu-\nation protocol called QAGS1that is designed\nto identify factual inconsistencies in a gener-\nated summary. QAGS is based on the intu-\nition that if we ask questions about a sum-\nmary and its source, we will receive simi-\nlar answers if the summary is factually con-\nsistent with the source. To evaluate QAGS,\nwe collect human judgments of factual consis-\ntency on model-generated summaries for the\nCNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015) and\nXSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) summarization\ndatasets. QAGS has substantially higher cor-\nrelations with these judgments than other au-\ntomatic evaluation metrics. Also, QAGS of-\nfers a natural form of interpretability: The an-\nswers and questions generated while comput-\ning QAGS indicate which tokens of a summary\nare inconsistent and why. We believe QAGS\nis a promising tool in automatically generating\nusable and factually consistent text.\n1 Introduction\nAutomatic summarization aims to produce sum-\nmaries that are succinct, coherent, relevant, and \u2014\ncrucially \u2014 factually correct. Recent progress in\nconditional text generation has led to models that\ncan generate \ufb02uent, topical summaries (Lewis et al.,\n2019). However, model-generated summaries fre-\nquently contain factual inconsistencies, limiting\ntheir applicability (Kryscinski et al., 2019a).\nThe problem of factual inconsistency is due in\npart to the lack of automatic evaluation metrics\nthat can detect such errors. Standard metrics for\nevaluating generated text are predominantly based\n1Pronounced \u201ckags\u201d.on counting n-grams, which weigh all n-grams\nequally and are insensitive to semantic errors. This\ninadequacy leaves human evaluation as the primary\nmethod for evaluating the factual consistencies,\nwhich has been noted to be challenging even for\nhumans (Daume III and Marcu, 2005; Kryscinski\net al., 2019b), in addition to being slow and costly.\nWe argue that evaluation metrics that are able\nto capture subtle semantic errors are required to\nbuild better models. In this work, we introduce a\ngeneral framework for evaluating conditional text\ngeneration that is designed to detect factual incon-\nsistencies in generated text with respect to some\ninput. Our framework consists of three steps: (1)\nGiven a generated text, a question generation (QG)\nmodel generates a set of questions about the text.\n(2) We then use question answering (QA) models\nto answer these questions given both the input and\nthe generated text. (3) A quality score is computed\nbased on the similarity of corresponding answers.\nThis approach leverages recent progress in QA\nand QG to ask and answer human readable, on-\ntopic questions (Devlin et al., 2019; Song et al.,\n2019). It only assumes access to a question answer-\ning dataset to train the QG and QA models, and is\napplicable to any modality where a QA model is\navailable, e.g. text, images, or knowledge graphs.\nWe use this framework to develop QAGS (Ques-\ntion Answering and Generation for Summariza-\ntion), a metric for evaluating the factual consis-\ntency of abstractive document summaries. Com-\npared to commonly used automatic metrics such\nas ROUGE (Lin, 2004), QAGS shows dramatically\nhigher correlations with human judgements of fac-\ntuality, for example achieving a Pearson correlation\ncoef\ufb01cient of 54.52 on the CNN/DailyMail sum-\nmarization task, compared to 17.72 for ROUGE-2.\nQAGS also achieves new state-of-the-art results\non evaluating the factuality of summaries, outper-\nforming recently proposed NLI models for this taskarXiv:2004.04228v1  [cs.CL]  8 Apr 2020\n(Kryscinski et al., 2019b).\nFinally, we analyse the robustness of QAGS\nthrough an ablation study. QAGS shows robust-\nness to the quality of the underlying QG and QA\nmodels, the domain of the models, and the number\nof questions asked. Even under the worst ablation\nsettings, QAGS still has stronger correlation with\nhuman judgments than other automatic metrics.\nOverall, we contribute the following: (1) We\nintroduce QAGS, an automatic model-based evalu-\nation metric for measuring the factual consistency\nof model-generated text. (2) We collect a new\nset of human judgments of factual consistency of\nmodel-generated summaries for two summariza-\ntion datasets. We demonstrate that QAGS corre-\nlates with these judgments signi\ufb01cantly better than\nother automatic metrics. (3) We show via abla-\ntions that QAGS is robust to a number of factors\nincluding underlying model quality and domain\nmismatch. (4) We analyze the questions and an-\nswers produced in computing QAGS to illustrate\nwhich parts of summaries are inconsistent. (5) We\nwill release models and code to compute QAGS.\n2 Background: Automatically\nEvaluating Machine Generated Text\nStandard approaches to evaluating generated text\nare primarily based on counting n-gram overlap.\nThese methods assume access to one or more refer-\nence texts, and score a generated summary based\non the precision and recall of all reference n-grams\nin the generated summary. We brie\ufb02y describe\nthe most common metrics in this family, and refer\nreaders to Liu et al. (2016) for further discussion.\nROUGE (Lin, 2004) was developed speci\ufb01cally\nfor evaluating automatic summarization, and its\nvariants are the de facto standard for such. The\nmost common variant is ROUGE- n(typicallyn2\nf1;2g), which computes the F1 score for all refer-\nencen-grams in the generated summary. ROUGE-\nL, another commonly used variant, is the length\nof the longest common subsequence (possibly non-\nconsecutive) between a summary and references.\nBLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) is closely related to\nROUGE but was developed for machine translation.\nBLEU computes the precision of the reference n-\ngrams in the generated summary. METEOR (Lavie\nand Agarwal, 2007) extends BLEU by using an\nalignment between the generated text and a ref-\nerence, as well as using stemming and synonym\nreplacement for more \ufb02exible n-gram matching.We identify two key de\ufb01ciencies when using\nthesen-gram based evaluation metrics to detect\nfactual inconsistencies in generated text.\nFirst, these metrics require one or more reference\ntexts to compare against. Obtaining references can\nbe expensive and challenging, and as such many\ntext generation datasets contain only a single ref-\nerence. This problem is exacerbated with high-\nentropy generation tasks, such as summarization\nor dialogue, where there is a very large number of\nacceptable outputs. In these settings, comparing\nagainst a single reference is woefully inadequate.\nSecond, given a reference to compare against,\nn-gram based approach weigh all portions of the\ntext equally, even when only a small fraction of\nthen-grams carry most of the semantic content.\nFactual inconsistencies caused by minor changes\nmay be drowned out by otherwise high n-gram\noverlap, making these metrics insensitive to these\nerrors. For example, the sentences \u201cI am writing\nmy paper in Vancouver.\u201d and \u201cI am not writing my\npaper in Vancouver.\u201d share nearly all unigrams and\nbigrams despite having the opposite meaning.\n3 A Framework for Automatically\nEvaluating Factual Consistency\nWe introduce a framework for automatically de-\ntecting factual inconsistencies in generated text\nwhile also addressing the de\ufb01ciencies of current\napproaches. Let XandYbe sequences of tokens\ncoming from a vocabulary VwhereXis a source\ntext andYis a summary of X. We de\ufb01nep(QjY)\nas a distribution over all possible questions Qgiven\nsummaryY, andp(AjQ;X )andp(AjQ;Y)as dis-\ntributions over all possible answers Ato a partic-\nular question Qgiven either the source Xor the\nsummaryY. We constrain the questions Qand\nanswersAto also be sequences of tokens from V.\nThen the factual consistency of the summary Yis\nEQ\u0018p(QjY)\u0002\nD\u0000\np(AjQ;X );p(AjQ;Y)\u0001\u0003\n;(1)\nwhereDis some function measuring the similar-\nity of the two answer distributions. This expression\nis maximized when Ycontains a subset of the infor-\nmation inXsuch that it produces the same answer\nfor any question from p(QjY). This happens triv-\nially whenY=X, e.g. we take Xas its own\nsummary, but we usually have other desiderata of\nYsuch that this solution is undesirable.\nSummarizationKevin Sin\ufb01eld scored his \ufb01rst try of the season against Castleford.

A set of questions is generated based on the summary. The questions are then\nanswered using both the source article and the summary. Corresponding answers are compared using a similarity\nfunction and averaged across questions to produce the \ufb01nal QAGS score.\nThis framework addresses the two issues with n-\ngram based approaches. Instead of requiring a refer-\nence to compare against, our framework asks ques-\ntions based on the generation itself, and compares\nanswers with the provided source text. Also, the\nuse of questions focuses the metric on the seman-\ntically relevant parts of the generated text, rather\nthan weighting all parts of the text equally.\nIn practice, exactly computing the expectation in\nEquation 1 is intractable due to the large space of\npossible questions. One potential workaround is to\nrandomly sample questions from p(QjY), but this\nsuffers from high variance and requires many sam-\nples to obtain a good estimate. Instead, we focus on\nproducing highly probable questions, e.g. as pro-\nduced by beam search, which may be biased in the\nlimit, but will require fewer questions to estimate\nbecause of the higher quality of the questions.\n4 QAGS\nUsing this framework requires specifying the ques-\ntion distribution p(QjY), the answer distribution\np(AjQ;Y)(orX), and the answer similarity func-\ntionD. We apply this framework to summarizationto develop QAGS and describe our instantiations\nof these components.\nQuestion Generation To instantiate p(QjY),\nwe draw on recent work on automatic question\ngeneration (QG), which models this distribution\nusing neural seq2seq models (Du et al., 2017; Kr-\nishna and Iyyer, 2019). We over-sample questions,\nand then \ufb01lter out low quality questions as follows.\nFirst, we train and generate from answer-\nconditional QG models: The model receives both\nthe answer and the source article, and is trained\nto maximize the likelihood of the paired question.\nAt test time, we extract named entities and noun\nphrases as answers candidates using spaCy.2\nSecond, we \ufb01lter out low-quality questions using\na number of heuristics, such as duplicates and ques-\ntions less than three tokens long. We also found it\nuseful to run the QA model (see next section) on all\nof the candidate questions, and \ufb01lter out questions\nfor which the QA model predicted no answer.\nQuestion Answering We instantiate the answer\ndistributions p(AjQ;\u0003)as extractive QA models,\n2https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer\nfor simplicity. We use extractive QA because we\nassume the facts are represented as text spans in the\narticle and summary. Future work should explore\nusing abstractive QA models, which could match\nparaphrases of the same answer.\nAnswer Similarity We use token-level F1 to\ncompare answers, which is standard for extractive\nQA and equivalent to de\ufb01ning Das\nF1(arg maxp(AjQ;X );arg maxp(AjQ;Y))\nThe QAGS Score Given these components, we\nobtain the QAGS score of a generation by (1) gen-\neratingKquestions conditioned on the summary,\n(2) answering the questions using both the source\narticle and the summary to get two sets of answers,\n(3) comparing corresponding answers using the\nanswer similarity metric, and (4) averaging the an-\nswer similarity metric over all questions. We depict\nthis process in Figure 1.\n5 Experiments\n5.1 Human Evaluation\nWe test whether QAGS accurately measures the\nfactual consistency of a summary with respect to\na source article by computing correlations with\nhuman judgments of factual consistency.\nDatasets We evaluate on two abstractive sum-\nmarization datasets, CNN/Daily Mail (CNNDM,\nHermann et al., 2015; Nallapati et al., 2016) and\nXSUM (Narayan et al., 2018). Abstractive sum-\nmarization is particularly interesting because fac-\ntual consistency with the original text is crucial\nto usability, and a lack of such consistency has\nplagued abstractive neural summarization models\n(Cao et al., 2018; Falke et al., 2019; Kryscinski\net al., 2019b, i.a.).\nCNN/DM is a standard dataset for summariza-\ntion that consists of CNN and DailyMail articles.\nEach reference summary consists of the concate-\nnation of three editor-written, bullet point high-\nlights. For summaries, we use 235 test outputs\nfrom Gehrmann et al. (2018).\nXSUM was created by taking the \ufb01rst sentence\nof a news article as the summary, and using the rest\nof the article as the source. Consequently, XSUM\nsummaries are signi\ufb01cantly more abstractive than\nthose of CNN/DM, and extractive summarization\nmodels perform poorly on this dataset.\nWe found that while the XSUM summaries are\nmore abstractive, frequently there are facts (e.g.Metric CNN/DM XSUM\nROUGE-1 28.74 13.22\nROUGE-2 17.72 8.95\nROUGE-L 24.09 8.86\nMETEOR 26.65 10.03\nBLEU-1 29.68 11.76\nBLEU-2 25.65 11.68\nBLEU-3 23.96 8.41\nBLEU-4 21.45 5.64\nBERTScore 27.63 2.51\nQAGS 54.53 17.49\nTable 1: Summary-level Pearson correlation coef\ufb01-\ncients between various automatic metrics and human\njudgments of correctness for summarization datasets.\nQAGS obtains substantially higher correlations than all\nother automatic metrics.\n\ufb01rst names) in the summary that are not available in\nthe \u201carticle\u201d. This quirk made it especially dif\ufb01cult\nfor humans and QAGS to tell when factual errors\nwere being made by the summarization model. To\nremedy this, for human evaluation and QAGS, we\nprepend the summary back to the \u201carticle\u201d. We use\na subset of 239 test outputs from BART \ufb01ne-tuned\non XSUM (Lewis et al., 2019).\nAnnotation Protocol We collect human judg-\nments on Amazon Mechanical Turk3via ParlAI\n(Miller et al., 2017). We present summaries one\nsentence at a time, along with the entire article. For\neach summary sentence, the annotator makes a bi-\nnary decision as to whether the sentence is factually\nconsistent with the article. Workers are instructed\nto mark non-grammatical sentences as not consis-\ntent, and copies of article sentences as consistent.\nWorkers are paid $ 1per full summary annotated.\nSee Appendix A for further details.\nWe collect 3 annotations per summary. To obtain\na single \u201ccorrectness\u201d score per summary, we \ufb01rst\ntake the majority vote for each sentence, then aver-\nage the binary scores across summary sentences.\nInter-annotator agreement as measured by Krip-\npendorff\u2019s\u000bis 0.51 and 0.34 for CNN/DM and\nXSUM, respectively indicating \u201cmoderate\u201d and\n\u201cfair\u201d agreement (Ageeva et al., 2015). While not\nperfect, these agreement numbers are in-line with\nsimilar \ufb01gures from previous work on summariza-\ntion evaluation (Daume III and Marcu, 2005).\n3https://www.mturk.com/\n5.2 Experimental Details\nQuestion Generation We use fairseq (Ott\net al., 2019) to \ufb01ne-tune a pretrained BART lan-\nguage model on NewsQA (Trischler et al., 2017),\na dataset consisting of CNN articles and crowd-\nsourced questions. For each summary, we use 10\nanswer candidates and generate questions using\nbeam search with width 10, for a total of 100 ques-\ntion candidates. After \ufb01ltering, we use the K= 20\nmost probable questions. If a summary has too\nfew \ufb01ltered questions, we randomly sample ques-\ntions to reach the required number. For details, see\nAppendix B.\nQuestion Answering We train QA models\nby \ufb01ne-tuning BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) on\nSQuAD2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2018). We use\nthelarge-uncased BERT variant via the\ntransformers library (Wolf et al., 2019).\nBaselines We compare against a number of au-\ntomatic evaluation metrics: ROUGE (Lin, 2004),\nMETEOR (Lavie and Agarwal, 2007), BLEU (Pa-\npineni et al., 2002), and BERTScore (Zhang et al.,\n2019). The latter uses BERT representations to\ncompute an alignment between generation and ref-\nerence tokens, and which is then used to com-\npute a soft version of unigram F1. We use the\nlarge-uncased BERT variant.\n5.3 Results\nWe present results in Table 1. QAGS strongly\noutperforms other automatic evaluation metrics in\nterms of correlation with human judgments of fac-\ntual consistency. BLEU and ROUGE perform com-\nparably, and lower order n-gram metrics work bet-\nter. BERTScore matches the best n-gram metrics\non CNN/DM, but the worst overall on XSUM.\nOn CNN/DM, QAGS obtains nearly twice the\ncorrelation of the next best automatic metric\n(BLEU-1). We speculate that this large increase\nis due to the sensitivity of the QA model to the\nsentence fusing behavior exhibited in many sum-\nmarization models trained on CNN/DM (Lebanoff\net al., 2019). When two sentences are fused to\nproduce an incorrect summary statement, the QA\nmodel produces different answers than when using\nthe source article versus when using the summary.\nOn XSUM, all metrics correlate worse with hu-\nman judgments than on CNN/DM, which re\ufb02ects\nthe fact that XSUM is more abstractive. QAGS still\noutperforms the next best automatic metric.QA modelSQuAD CNN/DM XSUM\n(F1) (Pear.)

We see some decrease in\ncorrelation on CNN/DM as QG perplexity increases,\nthough we do not see a similar trend for XSUM.\n5.4 Ablations\nA potential issue with model-based evaluation is\nthat the quality of the evaluation metric may de-\npend heavily on speci\ufb01c hyperparameter settings.\nWe explore whether this is true with QAGS by per-\nforming ablations on several factors.\nModel Quality We \ufb01rst consider the degree to\nwhich the quality of the underlying models impacts\ntheir evaluation capabilities.\nFor QA quality, we answer this question by\ntraining QA models of varying quality by \ufb01ne-\ntuning different versions of BERT on SQuAD.\nWe present results in Table 2. The QA mod-\nels perform similarly despite substantially dif-\nferent performances on the SQuAD develop-\nment set. Surprisingly, using the best QA\nmodel ( bert-large-wwm ) does not lead to the\nbest correlations with human judgments. On\nCNN/DM, bert-large-wwm slightly under-\nperforms bert-base andbert-large . On\nXSUM, bert-base slightly outperforms the\nother two BERT variants. These results indicate\nthat QAGS is fairly robust to the quality of the un-\nderlying QA model, though we note that BERT is a\nstrong QA baseline, and using weaker QA models\nmight lead to larger performance dropoffs.\nTo ablate QG quality, we use models with in-\n# Questions CNN/DM XSUM\n5 41.61 15.63\n10 41.17 15.49\n20 54.53 17.49\n50 57.94 17.74\nTable 4: Pearson correlation coef\ufb01cients between\nQAGS scores with varying number of questions and\nhuman judgments of correctness for summarization\ndatasets. The correlation increases with the number of\nquestions used, but with decreasing marginal bene\ufb01t.\ncreasing perplexity on the NewsQA development\nset. Results in Table 3 show that QAGS is robust\nto the QG model quality, with some decrease in\ncorrelation with human judgments as perplexity in-\ncreases on CNN/DM, and no clear trend on XSUM.\nEven the weakest QG model still signi\ufb01cantly out-\nperforms all other automatic metrics in Table 1.\nDomain Effects Our approach relies on having a\nlabeled dataset to train QG and QA models. How-\never, for relatively niche domains, such a labeled\nQA/QG dataset may not exist. Instead, we may\nneed to resort to using models trained on out-\nof-domain data, leading to domain shift effects\nthat negatively impact the quality of the QAGS\nscores. We simulate this setting by \ufb01ne-tuning the\nQG model on SQuAD, which is of similar size to\nNewsQA but drawn from Wikipedia articles rather\nthan CNN articles, which exactly matches the genre\nof the summarization datasets.\nEvaluating with this QG model, we get cor-\nrelations of 51.53 and 15.28 with human judg-\nments on CNN/DM and XSUM respectively, versus\n54.53 and 17.49 when using the NewsQA-tuned\nQG model. The drop in performance indicates a\nnegative domain shift effect. However using the\nSQuAD-tuned QG model still substantially outper-\nforms all other automatic metrics, again pointing\nto the robustness of QAGS.\nNumber of Questions Next, we investigate the\ncorrelation with human judgments when varying\nthe number of questions used. Results in Table 4\nshow that increasing the number of questions used\nimproves correlations with human judgments. We\nobserve a large increase when moving from 10\nto 20 questions, and a smaller increase from 20\nto 50 questions, indicating decreasing marginal\nbene\ufb01t moving beyond 50 questions.

QAGS outperforms previous work.\nother automatic metrics, indicating its robustness.\nAnswer Similarity Metric Finally, we consider\nusing exact match as an alternative answer sim-\nilarity metric. Exact match is another common\nevaluation metric for extractive QA, and is more re-\nstrictive than F1. When using EM, we obtain Pear-\nson correlations with human judgments of 45.97\nand 18.10 on CNN/DM and XSUM, as opposed to\n54.53 and 17.49 when using F1.\n6 Re-ranking with QAGS\nSeveral works explore the use of natural language\ninference (NLI) models to detect factual consis-\ntency in generated text (Welleck et al., 2019; Falke\net al., 2019). We compare against these methods\nby evaluating on the sentence ranking experiment\nfrom Falke et al. (2019). The experiment uses 373\ntriplets of source sentences from CNN/DM and two\nsummary sentences generated from the model from\nChen and Bansal (2018). One summary sentence is\nfactually consistent with the source sentence, and\nthe other is inconsistent. A metric (or model) is\nevaluated based on how often it ranks the consistent\nsentence higher than the inconsistent sentence.\nWe present the results in Table 5. Results using\ntwo NLI models \ufb01ne-tuned on MultiNLI (Williams\net al., 2018), BERT NLI and ESIM (Chen et al.,\n2017), are from Falke et al. (2019). FactCC\n(Kryscinski et al., 2019b) is an NLI-based fact-\nchecking model that is trained on a dataset tailor\nmade for detecting factual inconsistencies in gener-\nated text. QAGS outperforms these methods, while\nrequiring no special supervision for this task.\n7 Qualitative Analysis\nInterpreting QAGS The questions and answers\nproduced in computing QAGS are directly inter-\npretable, and highlight errors in summaries.

Because the QG model focuses\non these details, QAGS is able to correctly penalize\nthe summary for its hallucinations. Because the\nanswer candidates used are mostly named entities\nand noun phrases, QAGS is particularly effective\nat detecting errors of this kind. Using more di-\nverse answer candidates may broaden the set of\ninconsistencies that QAGS is able to detect.\nThe second example (Table 6, bottom), illus-\ntrates failure modes of QAGS. For example, theQA model incorrectly marks question 2 as unan-\nswerable. On question 4, both answers produced\nare correct, but because they have no common to-\nkens, they are marked inconsistent by QAGS.\nError Analysis The interpretability of QAGS al-\nlows for error analysis on the metric. We manually\nannotate 400 triplets of generated questions, article\nanswers, and summary answers that are produced\nin computing QAGS on the XSUM summaries, and\nlabel them by the quality of the generated questions,\npredicted answers, and answer similarity scores.\nAmong the generated questions, 8.75% are non-\nsensical, while 3.00% are well-formed but unan-\nswerable using the generated summary they were\nconditioned upon. These \ufb01gures indicate that the\nvast majority of questions are understandable and\non-topic. We frequently observe multiple questions\nwith slightly different wordings, which is likely\ndue to the low number of answer candidates in\nXSUM summaries (which are one sentence long)\nand due to beam search. 8.25% of questions are\nwell-formed but unanswerable using the source,\nwhich is usually due to a hallucinated fact in the\nsummary that the QG model turns into a question.\nAmong predicted answers, 1.75% of questions\nare potentially answerable using the summary, but\nare incorrectly answered. This percentage in-\ncreases to 32.50% for the article, which indicates\nthat the transfer ability of the QA model is lacking.\nIn a small number of cases, we found that while\na question had a single answer in the summary, it\ncould have multiple answers in the article.\nFinally, for 8.00% of the examples, the ques-\ntion is answered correctly using both the article\nand summary, but the answers have high lexical\nvariation such that F1 score fails to detect their\nsimilarity. While this happens in a relatively small\nnumber of cases, exploring similarity metrics other\nthann-gram based approaches could be useful.\nLimitations We emphasize that QAGS and our\noverall framework are speci\ufb01cally designed to de-\ntect factual inconsistencies in generated summaries\nrelative to the source article. QAGS does not mea-\nsure other desirable properties of generated text,\nincluding \ufb02uency, readability, or factual recall. We\ntherefore recommend using QAGS in conjunction\nwith complementary evaluation metrics.\nThe choices of QG and QA models in QAGS are\nparticular to abstractive summarization and may\nrequire adaptation to be used for other conditional\ntext generation tasks. For example, we expect that\nextractive summarization models may obtain nearly\nperfect QAGS scores because facts and statements\nare directly copied from the source article.\n8 Related Work\nAutomatic summarization and its evaluation are\nlong-standing lines of work in NLP, dating at least\nas far back as the Document Understanding Con-\nferences (Chali and Kolla, 2004). The primary\nevaluation metric then and now is ROUGE (Lin,\n2004), though much work has demonstrated the\nlimited ability of ROUGE and its relatives to evalu-\nate summaries (Dorr et al., 2004; Liu and Liu, 2009;\nKedzie et al., 2018, i.a.). Other metrics have fo-\ncused on speci\ufb01c aspects of summarization quality,\nincluding content selection (Nenkova and Passon-neau, 2004), relevance prediction (Daume III and\nMarcu, 2005), and many more.\nThere has been a recent resurgence of work lever-\naging NLU models for evaluating the factuality of\ngenerated text. Goodrich et al. (2019) use infor-\nmation extraction models to measure factual over-\nlap, but facts are restricted to pre-de\ufb01ned schemas.\nFalke et al. (2019) investigate the use of NLI mod-\nels to evaluate the factual correctness of CNN/DM\nsummaries, and conclude that current NLI models\nare too brittle to be reliably used in this manner.\nKryscinski et al. (2019b) train a NLI-based fact-\nchecking model by building a dataset of factual in-\nconsistencies based on noise heuristic. Our QA ap-\nproach allows a \ufb01ner-grained analysis, because NLI\noperates on complete sentences, whereas QAGS\ncan ask many questions about the same sentence.\nMost relatedly, Eyal et al. (2019) and Scialom\net al. (2019) use QA models to evaluate summariza-\ntion. We diverge from these works in two important\nways. First, both works use Cloze-style questions,\nwhich are generated by masking entities in either\nthe source document or the reference summary. We\ninstead generate the questions with a model, allow-\ning a much greater range of questions. Second,\nwe produce questions conditioned on the generated\nsummary, rather than the reference summary or\nsource article. Producing questions from the gener-\nated summary is more appropriate for verifying the\naccuracy of the text, whereas using the reference\nor source measures content selection.\n9 Conclusion\nWe introduce a framework for automatically detect-\ning factual inconsistencies in conditionally gener-\nated texts and use this framework to develop QAGS,\na metric for measuring inconsistencies in abstrac-\ntive summarization. QAGS correlates with human\njudgments of factuality signi\ufb01cantly better than\nstandard automatic evaluation metrics for summa-\nrization, and outperforms related NLI-based ap-\nproaches to factual consistency checking. QAGS is\nnaturally interpretable: The questions and answers\nproduced in computing QAGS indicate which to-\nkens in a generated summary are inconsistent and\nwhy. Error analysis shows that future work should\nexplore improved QA models. Our approach can\nalso be applied to diverse modalities, such as trans-\nlation and image captioning. Overall, we believe\nQAGS is useful in quantifying and incentivizing\nfactually consistent text generation.\nReferences\nEkaterina Ageeva, Mikel L. Forcada, Francis M.

Workeres are required to have at least 1000\napproved HITs with an acceptance rate of at least\n98%.\nThe base reward for our task is $0.15. For each\nsummary, we include automatic quality checks in-\ncluding\n\u000fTime checks: workers who complete the task\nunder 30s fail the check\n\u000fAttention checks: we include exact copies of\narticle sentences and corrupted mixtures of\ntwo article sentences as positive and negative\ncontrol task. If a worker fails to answer both\nof these examples correctly, they fail the check\n\u000fExplanation checks: For each sentence in the\nsummary, the worker is required to provide a\nshort explanation of their decision\nIf a worker passes all checks, they are awarded\na $0.85 bonus, totalling $1.00 per correct annota-\ntion. According to turkerview.com , workers of\nour HIT are paid well in excess of $15.00 on aver-\nage.\nWe show our annotation interfaces for the anno-\ntation task for CNN/DM and XSUM respectively\nin Figures 2 and 3. We use slightly different instruc-\ntions to accommodate for the quirks of each dataset.\nFor XSUM, we prepend the reference \u201csummary\u201d\nback onto the source article, as without it, workers\nwere struggling to identify factual inconsistencies.\nB Model and Generation Details\nQuestion Generation We \ufb01ne-tune BART for\nquestion generation using the same tuning hyper-\nparameters as the original work. We optimize label\nsmoothed cross entropy with smoothing parameter\n0.1 (Pereyra et al., 2017) and a peak learning rate of\n2e-5. We optimize for 100k steps with 5k warmup\nsteps, and use the model with the best perplexity\non the development set.\nTo turn NewsQA into an answer conditional QG\ndataset, we concatenate the answer to the source\narticle with a special marker token in between. We\nthen concatenate another special marker token and\nthe question. At test time, we get 10 named entities\nand noun phrases as answer candidates using the\nen-web-sm spaCy model. We downsampling if\nthere are more than 10 and randomly duplicatingsome answers if there are more than 10. The model\npredicts the question after seeing an answer and the\narticle.\nDuring decoding, we use beam search with beam\nsize 10, length penalty 1.0, and trigram repetition\nblocking. We experimented with top- k(Holtz-\nman et al., 2019) and top- p(Fan et al., 2018), but\nthe outputted questions, while diverse, were quite\nnoisy. Generations have minimum length 8 and\nmax length 60.\nTo \ufb01lter the questions, we \ufb01rst use simple heuris-\ntics, including removing\n\u000feverything after the \ufb01rst question mark in a\nquestion\n\u000fexact duplicates\n\u000fquestions shorter than three tokens long\nFor the remaining questions, we use our QA model\nto answer each question and we remove questions\nfor which the QA model deems unanswerable. We\nthen take the top 20 most probable questions, ran-\ndom sampling some of the \ufb01ltered questions if there\nwere too few.\nQuestion Answering We \ufb01ne-tune BERT for\nquestion answering following the original work.\nWe optimize using AdamW (Loshchilov and Hut-\nter, 2018) with initial learning rate 5e-5. We train\nfor 3 epochs, with a warmup ratio of 0.1. We use\nthe model with the best development set perfor-\nmance.\nWe use SQuAD2.0 because we found the unan-\nswerable questions useful for \ufb01ltering out questions\nand questions based on hallucinated facts in the\nsummary should be unanswerable using the source\narticle. Similar to the QG setting, we append the\nquestion and answer to the source article with in-\ntervening special marker tokens.\nFigure 2: Annotation interface and instructions for CNN/DM factual consistency task.\nFigure 3: Annotation interface and instructions for XSUM factual consistency task."

These issues could be partially addressed\nby introducing external knowledge graphs (KG) in LLM reasoning. In this paper,\nwe propose a new LLM-KG integrating paradigm \u201c LLM\u2297KG\u201d which treats the\nLLM as an agent to interactively explore related entities and relations on KGs\nand perform reasoning based on the retrieved knowledge. We further implement\nthis paradigm by introducing a new approach called Think-on-Graph (ToG), in\nwhich the LLM agent iteratively executes beam search on KG, discovers the most\npromising reasoning paths, and returns the most likely reasoning results. We use\na number of well-designed experiments to examine and illustrate the following\nadvantages of ToG: 1) compared with LLMs, ToG has better deep reasoning power;\n2) ToG has the ability of knowledge traceability and knowledge correctability by\nleveraging LLMs reasoning and expert feedback; 3) ToG provides a flexible plug-\nand-play framework for different LLMs, KGs and prompting strategies without\nany additional training cost; 4) the performance of ToG with small LLM models\ncould exceed large LLM such as GPT-4 in certain scenarios and this reduces the\ncost of LLM deployment and application. As a training-free method with lower\ncomputational cost and better generality, ToG achieves overall SOTA in 6 out of\n9 datasets where most previous SOTAs rely on additional training. Our code is\npublicly available at https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/ToG .\n1 I NTRODUCTION\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Ouyang et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Thoppilan et al., 2022; Brown\net al., 2020a; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023) have demonstrated remarkable perfor-\nmance across various natural language processing tasks. These models capitalize on pre-training\ntechniques applied to vast text corpora to generate responses that are coherent and contextually\nappropriate. Despite their impressive performance, LLMs have substantial limitations when facing\ncomplex knowledge reasoning tasks (Petroni et al., 2021; Talmor et al., 2019; Talmor & Berant, 2018;\nZhang et al., 2023) that require deep and responsible reasoning. Firstly, LLMs usually fail to provide\naccurate answers to questions requiring specialized knowledge beyond what was included in the\npre-training phase (out-of-date knowledge in Figure 1a), or to questions requiring long logic chain and\nmulti-hop knowledge reasoning. Secondly, LLMs lack responsibility, explainability and transparency,\n\u2217Equal contribution.\n\u2020Work done during internship at IDEA Research.\n\u2021Corresponding author.\n1arXiv:2307.07697v6  [cs.CL]  24 Mar 2024\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nQuestion\uff1aWhat is the majority party now in the country where Canberra is located?(Chain-of-Thought Prompt): Let\u2019s think step by step.Response: Canberrais the capital of Australia.

Thirdly, the training process for LLMs\nis often expensive and time-consuming, making it challenging to keep their knowledge up to date.\nRecognizing these challenges, a natural and promising solution is to incorporate external knowledge\nsuch as knowledge graphs (KGs) to help improve LLM reasoning. KGs offer structured, explicit,\nand editable representations of knowledge, presenting a complementary strategy to mitigate the\nlimitations of LLMs (Pan et al., 2023). Researchers (Li et al., 2023c; Xie et al., 2022; Baek et al.,\n2023b; Yang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023a; Jiang et al., 2023) have explored the usage of KGs as\nexternal knowledge sources to mitigate hallucination in LLMs. These approaches follow a routine:\nretrieve information from KGs, augment the prompt accordingly, and feed the increased prompt into\nLLMs (as illustrated in Figure 1b). In this paper, we refer to this paradigm as \u201c LLM\u2295KG\u201d. Although\naiming to integrate the power of LLM and KG, in this paradigm, LLM plays the role of translator\nwhich transfers input questions to machine-understandable command for KG searching and reasoning,\nbut it does not participate in the graph reasoning process directly. Unfortunately, the loose-coupling\nLLM\u2295KGparadigm has its own limitations, and its success depends heavily on the completeness\nand high quality of KG. In Figure 1b, for example, although LLM successfully identified necessary\nrelation types required to answer the question, the absence of the relation \u201cmajority party\u201d leads to a\nfailure in retrieving the correct answer.\nBuilding upon these considerations, we propose a new tight-coupling \u201c LLM\u2297KG\u201d paradigm where\nKGs and LLMs work in tandem, complementing each other\u2019s capabilities in each step of graph\nreasoning. Figure 1c provides an example illustrating the advantage of LLM\u2297KG. In this example,\nthe missing relation \"majority party\" resulting in the failure in Figure 1b can be complemented by\na reference triple (Australia ,prime minister ,Anthony Albanese )discovered by the LLM agent\nwith dynamic reasoning ability (Yao et al., 2022), as well as the political party membership of\nAnthony Albanese coming from LLM\u2019s inherent knowledge. In this way, the LLM succeeds in\ngenerating the correct answer with reliable knowledge retrieved from KGs. As an implementation of\nthis paradigm, we propose an algorithmic framework \u201cThink-on-Graph\u201d (meaning: LLMs \u201cThink\u201d\nalong the reasoning paths \u201con\u201d knowledge \u201cgraph\u201d step-by-step, abbreviated as ToG below), for deep,\nresponsible, and efficient LLM reasoning. Using the beam search algorithm (Jurafsky & Martin,\n2009) in KG/LLM reasoning (Atif et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Xie et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024),\nToG allows LLM to dynamically explore a number of reasoning paths in KG and make decisions\naccordingly. Given an input question, ToG first identifies initial entities and then iteratively calls the\nLLM to retrieve relevant triples from KGs through exploration (looking for relevant triples in KG via\n\u201con graph\u201d step) and reasoning (deciding on the most relevant triples via \u201cthink\u201d step) until adequate\n2\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nQuestion:What is the majority party now in the country where Canberra is located?\nCanberracapital ofcountryterritorycontinent\nAustralia\npart of\nLabor PartyAnswer\n1.

The glowing entities are the central entities where the\nsearch starts at each iteration (depth), and the entities with boldface are the selected central entities\nfor the next iteration after pruning. At each pruning step, the darkness of the edges represents the\nranking score given by LLM, and the dashed lines indicate relations that have been pruned due to low\nevaluation scores.\ninformation through the top-N reasoning paths in beam search is gathered to answer the question\n(judged by LLMs in \"Think\" step) or the predefined maximum search depth is reached.\nThe advantage of ToG can be abbreviated as (1) Deep reasoning: ToG extracts diverse and multi-\nhop reasoning paths from KGs as the basis for LLM reasoning, enhancing LLMs\u2019 deep reasoning\ncapabilities for knowledge-intensive tasks. (2) Responsible reasoning: Explicit, editable reasoning\npaths improve the explainability of the reasoning process of LLMs, and enable the tracing and\ncorrection of the provenances of models\u2019 outputs. (3) Flexibility and efficiency: a) ToG is a plug-\nand-play framework that can be applied to a variety of LLMs and KGs seamlessly. b) Under ToG\nframework, knowledge can be updated frequently via KG instead of LLM whose knowledge-update\nis expensive and slow. c) ToG enhances the reasoning ability of small LLMs (e.g., LLAMA2-70B) to\nbe competitive with big LLMs (e.g., GPT-4).\n2 M ETHODS\nToG implements the \u201c LLM\u2297KG\u201d paradigm by asking LLM to perform beam search on knowledge\ngraph. Specifically, it prompts the LLM to iteratively explore multiple possible reasoning paths on\nKGs until the LLM determines that the question can be answered based on the current reasoning\npaths. ToG constantly updates and maintains top- Nreasoning paths P={p1, p2, . . . , p N}for the\nquestion xafter each iteration, where Ndenotes the width of beam search. The entire inference\nprocess of ToG contains the following 3 phases: initialization, exploration, and reasoning.\n2.1 T HINK -ON-GRAPH\n2.1.1 I NITIALIZATION OF GRAPH SEARCH\nGiven a question, ToG leverages the underlying LLM to localize the initial entity of the reasoning\npaths on knowledge graph. This phase can be regarded as the initialization of the top- Nreasoning\npaths P. ToG first prompts LLMs to automatically extract the topic entities in question and gets the\n3\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\ntop-Ntopic entities E0={e0\n1, e0\n2, ..., e0\nN}to the question. Note that the number of topic entities\nmight possibly be less than N.\n2.1.2 E XPLORATION\nAt the beginning of the D-th iteration, each path pnconsists of D\u22121triples, i.e., pn=\n{(ed\ns,n, rd\nj,n, ed\no,n)}D\u22121\nd=1, where ed\ns,nanded\no,ndenote subject and object entities, rd\nj,nis a specific\nrelation between them, (ed\ns,n, rd\nj,n, ed\no,n)and(ed+1\ns,n, rd+1\nj,n, ed+1\no,n)are connected to each other. The\nsets of the tail entities and relations in Pare denoted as ED\u22121={eD\u22121\n1, eD\u22121\n2, ..., eD\u22121\nN}and\nRD\u22121={rD\u22121\n1, rD\u22121\n2, ..., rD\u22121\nN}, respectively.\nThe exploration phase in the D-th iteration aims to exploit the LLM to identify the most relevant\ntop-Nentities EDfrom the neighboring entities of the current top- Nentity set ED\u22121based on the\nquestion xand extend the top- Nreasoning paths PwithED. To address the complexity of handling\nnumerous neighboring entities with the LLM, we implement a two-step exploration strategy: first,\nexploring significant relations, and then using selected relations to guide entity exploration.\nRelation Exploration Relation exploration is a beam search process with the depth of 1 and the\nwidth of NfromED\u22121toRD. The whole process can be decomposed into two steps: Search and\nPrune . The LLM serves as an agent to automatically complete this process.\n\u2022Search At the beginning of the D-th iteration, the relation exploration phase first searches out\nrelations RD\ncand,n linked to the tail entity eD\u22121\nn for each reasoning path pn. These relations are\naggregated into RD\ncand. In the case of Figure 2, E1={Canberra }andR1\ncand denotes the set of all\nrelations linked to Canberra inwards or outwards. Notably, the Search procedure can be easily\ncompleted by executing two simple pre-defined formal queries shown in Appendix E.1 and E.2,\nwhich makes ToG adapt well to different KGs without any training cost .\n\u2022Prune Once we have obtained the candidate relation sets RD\ncand and the expanded candidate reason-\ning paths Pcand from the relation search, we can utilize the LLM to select out new top- Nreasoning\npaths Pending with the tail relations RDfromPcand based on the literal information of the ques-\ntionxand the candidate relations RD\ncand. The prompt used here can be found in Appendix E.3.1.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the LLM selects top-3 relations {capital of ,country ,territory }out\nfrom all relations linked to the entity Canberra in the first iteration. Since Canberra is the\nonly topic entity, the top-3 candidate reasoning paths are updated as {(Canberra, capital of ),\n(Canberra, country ),(Canberra, territory )}.\nEntity Exploration Similar to relationship exploration, entity exploration is also a beam search\nprocess performed by the LLM from RDtoED, and consists of two steps, Search andPrune .\n\u2022Search Once we have obtained new top- Nreasoning paths Pand the set of new tail relations\nRDfrom relation exploration, for each relation path pn\u2208P, we can explore a candidate entity\nsetED\ncand,n by querying (eD\u22121\nn, rD\nn,?)or(?, rD\nn, eD\u22121\nn), where eD\u22121\nn, rndenote the tail entity\nand relation of pn. We can aggregate {ED\ncand, 1, ED\ncand, 2, ..., ED\ncand,N}intoED\ncand and expand\ntop-Nreasoning paths PtoPcand with the tail entities ED\ncand. For the shown case, E1\ncand can be\nrepresented as {Australia ,Australia ,Australian Capital Territory }.\n\u2022Prune Since the entities in each candidate set ED\ncand is expressed in natural language, we can\nleverage the LLM to select new top- Nreasoning paths Pending with the tail entities EDout\nfrom Pcand. The prompt used here can be found in Appendix E.3.2. As shown in Figure 2,\nAustralia and Australian Capital Territory are scored as 1 since the relations capital of ,\ncountry andterritory are only linked to one tail entity respectively, and the current reason-\ning paths pare updated as {(Canberra, capital of, Australia ),(Canberra, country, Australia ),\n(Canberra, territory, Australian Capital Territory )}.\nAfter executing the two explorations described above, we reconstruct new top- Nreasoning paths P\nwhere the length of each path increases by 1. Each prune step requires at most NLLM calls.\n4\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n2.1.3 R EASONING\nUpon obtaining the current reasoning path Pthrough the exploration process, we prompt the LLM to\nevaluate whether the current reasoning paths are adequate for generating the answer. If the evaluation\nyields a positive result, we prompt the LLM to generate the answer using the reasoning paths with\nthe query as inputs as illustrated in Figure 2. The prompt used for evaluation and generation can be\nfound in Appendix E.3.3 and E.3.4. Conversely, if the evaluation yields a negative result, we repeat\ntheExploration andReasoning steps until the evaluation is positive or reaches the maximum\nsearch depth Dmax. If the algorithm has not yet concluded, it signifies that even upon reaching\ntheDmax, ToG remains unable to explore the reasoning paths to resolve the question. In such a\nscenario, ToG generates the answer exclusively based on the inherent knowledge in the LLM. The\nwhole inference process of ToG contains Dexploration phases and Devaluation steps as well as a\ngeneration step, which needs at most 2ND+D+ 1calls to the LLM.\n2.2 R ELATION -BASED THINK -ON-GRAPH\nPrevious KBQA methods, particularly based on semantic parsing, have predominantly relied on rela-\ntion information in questions to generate formal queries (Lan et al., 2022). Inspired by this, we propose\nrelation-based ToG (ToG-R) that explores the top- Nrelation chains {pn= (e0\nn, r1\nn, r2\nn, ..., rD\nn)}N\nn=1\nstarting with the topic entities {e0\nn}N\nn=1instead of triple-based reasoning paths. ToG-R sequentially\nperforms relation search ,relation prune andentity search in each iteration, which is the same as ToG.\nThen ToG-R performs the reasoning step based on all candidate reasoning paths ending with ED\ncand\nobtained by entity search. If the LLM determines that the retrieved candidate reasoning paths do not\ncontain enough information for the LLM to answer the question, we randomly sample N entities\nfrom the candidate entities ED\ncand and continue to the next iteration. Assuming that entities in each\nentity set ED\ncand,n probably belong to the same entity class and have similar neighboring relations,\nthe results of pruning the entity set {ED\ncand,n}N\nn=1might have little impact on the following relation\nexploration. Thus, we use the random beam search instead of the LLM-constrained beam search in\nToG for entity prune , referred to as random prune . Algorithm 1 and 2 show the implementation\ndetails of the ToG and ToG-R. ToG-R needs at most ND+D+ 1calls to the LLM.\nCompared to ToG, ToG-R offers two key benefits: 1) It eliminates the need for the process of pruning\nentities using the LLM, thereby reducing the overall cost and reasoning time. 2) ToG-R primarily\nemphasizes the literal information of relations, mitigating the risk of misguided reasoning when the\nliteral information of intermediate entities is missing or unfamiliar to the LLM.\n3 E XPERIMENTS\n3.1 E XPERIMENTAL DESIGN\n3.1.1 D ATASETS AND EVALUATION METRICS\nIn order to test ToG\u2019s ability on multi-hop knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, we evaluate ToG\non five KBQA datasets (4 Multi-hop and 1 Single-hop): CWQ (Talmor & Berant, 2018), WebQSP\n(Yih et al., 2016), GrailQA (Gu et al., 2021), QALD10-en (Perevalov et al., 2022), Simple Questions\n(Bordes et al., 2015). Moreover, in order to examine ToG on more generic tasks, we also prepare\none open-domain QA dataset: WebQuestions (Berant et al., 2013); two slot filling datasets: T-REx\n(ElSahar et al., 2018) and Zero-Shot RE (Petroni et al., 2021); and one fact-checking dataset: Creak\n(Onoe et al., 2021). Note that, for two big datasets GrailQA and Simple Questions, we only randomly\nselected 1,000 samples each for testing in order to save computational cost. For all datasets, exact\nmatch accuracy (Hits@1) is used as our evaluation metric following previous works (Li et al., 2023c;\nBaek et al., 2023b; Jiang et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023a).\n3.1.2 M ETHODS SELECTED FOR COMPARISON\nWe compare with standard prompting (IO prompt) (Brown et al., 2020b), Chain-of-Thought prompting\n(CoT prompt) (Wei et al., 2022), and Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023c) with 6 in-context\nexemplars and \"step-by-step\" reasoning chains.

We use OpenAI API to call\nChatGPT (GPT-3.5-turbo) and GPT-41. Llama-\n2-70B-Chat (Touvron et al., 2023) runs with 8\nA100-40G without quantization, where the tem-\nperature parameter is set to 0.4 for exploration\nprocess (increasing diversity) and set to 0 for rea-\nsoning process (guaranteeing reproducibility).\nThe maximum token length for the generation\nis set to 256. In all experiments, we set both\nwidth Nand depth Dmax to 3 for beam search.\nFreebase (Bollacker et al., 2008) is used as KG\nfor CWQ, WebQSP, GrailQA, Simple Questions,\nand Webquestions, and Wikidata (Vrande \u02c7ci\u00b4c &\nKr\u00f6tzsch, 2014) is used as KG for QALD10-en,\nT-REx, Zero-Shot RE and Creak. We use 5 shots\nin ToG-reasoning prompts for all the datasets.\n3.2 M AINRESULTS\n3.2.1 C OMPARISON TO OTHER METHODS\nSince CoT uses external KG to enhance LLM,\nwe first compare it with those methods lever-\naging external knowledge as well. As we can\nsee in Figure 1, even if ToG is a training-free\nprompting-based method and has natural disad-\nvantage in comparison with those fine-tuning\nmethods trained with data for evaluation, ToG\nwith GPT-4 still achieves new SOTA performance in 6 out of 9 datasets, including WebQSP, GrailQA,\n1GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 is both from https://openai.com/\n6\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nQALD10-en, WebQuestions, Zero-Shot RE and Creak. Even for some dataset without SOTA, e.g.,\nCWQ, the performance of CoT has already been close to SOTA (69.5% v.s. 70.4%). If comparing\nwith all promoting-based methods, both ToG with GPT-4 and its weaker version ToG with ChatGPT\ncan win the competition in all datasets. In particular, the improvement of 1.6% on open-domain QA\ndataset WebQuestions demonstrates the ToG\u2019s generality on open-domain QA tasks. We also notice\nthat the performance of ToG on single-hop KBQA dataset is not as good as its performance on other\ndatasets. These results indicate that ToG is more effective on multi-hop datasets in general, which\nsupports our argument that ToG enhances the deep reasoning capability of LLMs.\nWe also see from Figure 1 that, compared with those methods without leveraging external knowledge\n(e.g, IO, CoT and SC prompting methods), the advantage of ToG is more significant. For example,\nthe performance improves 51.8% and 42.9% on GrailQA and Zero-Shot RE, respectively. It turns out\nthat benefits from external KG can not be ignored in reasoning.\nToG outperforms ToG-R on most datasets since the triple-based reasoning paths provide additional\nintermediate entity information compared to the relation chains retrieved by ToG-R. More detailed\nanalysis of the answers generated by ToG can be checked in Appendix B.2. And the results of\nprevious methods on each dataset are reported in Appendix C for better comparison,\n3.2.2 P ERFORMANCES WITH DIFFERENT BACKBONE MODELS\nGiven ToG\u2019s flexibility of plug-and-play, we evaluate how different backbone models affect its\nperformance on two datasets CWQ and WebQSP. Table 2 shows that, as we expected, the performance\nof CoT improves with the size (also reflecting partially the reasoning ability) of backbone models\n(GPT-4 > ChatGPT > Llama-2). Furthermore, we see that, the larger the backbone model, the larger\nthe gap between CoT and ToG (the gain increases from 18.5% for Llama-2 to 23.5% for GPT-4\non CWQ, and from 11.5% for Llama-2 to 15.3% for GPT-4 on WebQSP), and this indicates more\npotential of KG can be mined using a more powerful LLM.\nIn addition, even if using the smallest model Llama-2 (70B parameters), ToG outperforms CoT with\nGPT-4. This implies a much cheaper technical route for LLM deployment and application, i.e., TOG\nwith cheap small LLM may be a candidate for substituting expensive big LLM, especially in vertical\nscenarios that external KGs can cover.\n3.2.3 A BLATION STUDY\nWe perform various ablation studies to understand the importance of different factors in ToG. We\nconduct our ablation studies on two subsets of the test sets of CWQ and WebQSP, each of which\ncontains 1,000 randomly sampled questions.\nMethod CWQ WebQSP\nCoT 37.6 62.0\nToG\nw/ Freebase 58.8 76.2\nw/ WikiData 54.9 68.6\nToG-R\nw/ Freebase 59.2 75.1\nw/ WikiData 51.9 66.7\nTable 3: Performances of ToG using\ndifferent source KGs on CWQ and We-\nbQSP.Do search depth and width matter for ToG? To ex-\nplore the influence of the search depth Dmax and the beam\nwidth Non ToG\u2019s performance, we conduct experiments\nunder settings with depths ranging from 1 to 4 and widths\nfrom 1 to 4. As shown in Figure 3, ToG\u2019s performance im-\nproves with the search depth and width. This also implies\nthat ToG\u2019s performance could potentially be improved\nwith the increment of the exploration depth and breadth.\nHowever, considering the computational cost (which in-\ncreases linearly with the depth), we set both the depth\nand width to 3 as the default experimental setting. On\nthe other hand, the performance growth diminishes when\nthe depth exceeds 3. This is mainly because only a small\npart of questions have the reasoning depths (based on the\nnumber of relations in SPARQL, as seen in Figure 12 in\nthe Appendix) of greater than 3.\nDo different KGs affect ToG\u2019s performance? One of the main advantages of ToG is its plug-and-\nplay capabilities. As shown in Table 3, ToG achieves significant improvements with different source\nKGs on CWQ and WebQSP, compared to CoT. On the other hand, different source KGs might have\n7\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 3: Performances of ToG with different search depths and widths.\ndifferent effects on the performance of ToG. Notably, Freebase brings more significant improvements\non CWQ and WebQSP than Wikidata, since both datasets are constructed upon Freebase. Moreover,\nin a very large KG like Wikidata, the searching and pruning processes are relatively challenging.\nMethod CWQ WebQSP\nToG\nw/ Triples 58.8 76.2\nw/ Sequences 57.2 73.2\nw/ Sentences 58.6 73\nToG-R\nw/ Sequences 59.2 75.1\nw/ Sentences 50.1 67.3\nTable 4: Performances of ToG using dif-\nferent prompting designs.How do different prompt designs affect ToG?

For example, \"(Canberra, capital of,\nAustralia)\" can be converted to \"The capital of Canberra\nis Australia.\" The result shows that the utilization of triple-\nbased representations for the reasoning paths yields the\nhighest degree of efficiency and superior performance.\nConversely, when considering ToG-R, each reasoning path\nis a relation chain starting from a topic entity, rendering it incompatible with the triple-based prompt\nrepresentation. Consequently, the transformation of ToG-R into the natural language form results in\nexcessively lengthy prompts, thereby leading to a notable deterioration in performance.\nMethod CWQ WebQSP\nToG\nw/BM25 51.4 58.7\nw/SentenceBERT 51.7 66.3\nw/ChatGPT 58.8 76.2\nToG-R\nw/BM25 49.4 57.3\nw/SentenceBERT 50.1 60.1\nw/ChatGPT 59.2 75.1\nTable 5: Performances of ToG using dif-\nferent pruning tools.Comparing the affects from different pruning tools.\nOther than the LLM, lightweight models that can mea-\nsure text similarity like BM25 and SentenceBERT, can\nbe employed as pruning tools in the exploration phase.\nWe can select top- Nentities and relations based on their\nliteral similarities with the question.

The replacement of\nthe LLM with either BM25 or SentenceBERT results in\nthe significant performance degradation of our approach.\nConcretely, the results on CWQ drop on average by 8.4%,\nand the results on WebQSP drop on average by 15.1%.\nThe results show that the LLMs perform best as a pruning\ntool in terms of effectiveness. On the other hand, after utilizing the BM25 or SentenceBERT, we\nonly need D+ 1calls to the LLM instead of 2ND+D+ 1as we discuss in Section 2.1.3, which\nenhances the efficiency of ToG.\nWe conduct additional ablation studies on the effect of the number of seed exemplars and the\ndifference between ToG and naive beam search on the KG, which can be seen in Appendix B.1.\n3.3 K NOWLEDGE TRACEABILITY AND CORRECTABILITY IN TOG\nThe quality of KG is very important for correct reasoning by ToG. An interesting feature of ToG is\nknowledge traceability and knowledge correctability during LLM reasoning, and it provides a way to\nimprove KG\u2019s quality using ToG itself and reduce the cost of KG construction and correction. As\nillustrated in Figure 4, the explicit reasoning paths of the ToGs can be displayed to users. If potential\n8\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 4: The illustration of knowledge traceability and correctability of ToG.\nerrors or uncertainties in ToG answers are discovered by human users/experts or other LLMs, ToG\nhas the ability to trace back and examine the reasoning path, find suspicious triples with errors, and\ncorrect them.\nTake the case in Figure 4 as an example. Given the input question \u201cWhat is mascot Phillie Phanatic\u2019s\nteam\u2019s spring training stadium?\u201d, ToG outputs the wrong answer \u201cBright House Field\u201d in the first\nround. Then ToG traces back all reasoning paths, localizes the cause of the error may come from the\nsecond reasoning path (Phillie PhanaticTeam\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 Philadelphia PhilliesArena Stadium\u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2192 Bright House Field),\nand analyzes that the error comes from the old name \u201cSpecturm Field\u201d of \u201cBright House Field\u201d in\nthe outdated triple ( Philadelphia Phillies ,Arena Stadium ,Bright House Field ). According to the\nhints from ToG, user can ask LLM to correct this error and answer the same question with correct\ninformation. This example reveals that ToG not only enhances LLM with KG, but also improves the\nquality of KG with LLM, known as knowledge infusion (Moiseev et al., 2022).\n4 R ELATED WORK\nReasoning with LLM Prompting Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) has been shown to be\neffective in enhancing LLM reasoning. It creates a series of prompt instances according to reasoning\nlogic under a few-shot learning paradigm in order to improve LLM\u2019s performance on complex tasks.\nThe thought of CoT has been improved along different dimensions, including Auto-CoT (Zhang\net al., 2022), Complex-CoT (Fu et al., 2023), Self-Consistency (Wang et al., 2023c), Zero-Shot-CoT\n(Kojima et al., 2022), Iter-CoT (Sun et al., 2023b), ToT (Yao et al., 2023), GoT (Besta et al., 2023)\nand so on. Given the limitation that all these works only use the knowledge in training data, recent\nefforts such as ReAct (Yao et al., 2022) attempt to utilize the information from external sources such\nas Wiki documents to further improve the reasoning performance.\nKG-enhanced LLM KG has advantages in dynamic, explicit, and structured knowledge repre-\nsentation (Pan et al., 2023) and techniques combining LLMs with KGs have been studied. Early\nstudies (Peters et al., 2019; Huang et al., 2024; Luo et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b;\nLiu et al., 2020) embed structured knowledge from KGs into the underlying neural networks during\nthe pretraining or fine-tuning process. However, KG embedded in LLM sacrifices its own nature of\nexplainability in knowledge reasoning and efficiency in knowledge updating (Hu et al., 2023).\nRecent works instead combine LLMs with KGs by translating relevant structured knowledge from\nKGs to textual prompts for LLMs. All the methods follow a fixed pipeline that retrieves extra\ninformation from KGs to augment the LLM prompt and they belong to the LLM\u2295KGparadigm we\ndefined in the introduction section. On the other hand, Jiang et al. (2023) asks LLM to explore KG\nand so it can be regarded as a special case of ToG, which belongs to the LLM \u2297KG paradigms.\n9\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n5 C ONCLUSION\nWe introduce the LLM\u2297KGparadigm for integrating LLMs and KGs in a tight-coupling manner,\nand propose the Think-on-Graph (ToG) algorithmic framework which leverages LLM as a agent\nparticipating in KG reasoning for better decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that ToG\noutperforms existing fine-tuning-based methods and prompting-based methods without additional\ntraining cost and mitigates the hallucination issue of LLMs.\n6 A CKNOWLEDGEMENT\nWe express our sincere gratitude to the esteemed reviewers for their invaluable feedback and con-\nstructive comments, which significantly contributed to the improvement and refinement of this paper.\nTheir insightful suggestions and meticulous attention to detail have played a pivotal role in enhancing\nthe quality and clarity of our research work.\nREFERENCES\nFarah Atif, Ola El Khatib, and Djellel Eddine Difallah.

We conduct\nzero-shot experiment and select 1-6 examples from the training set as few-shot setting. In the few-\nshot tests, we randomly chose Mof{1,2,3,4,6}exemplars as demonstrations and replicated the\nexperiments three times. As the number of examples in the demonstrations increases, the overall\nperformance also generally improves. However, the performance peaks for ToG and ToG-R differ\n(with the best performance for ToG at 5-shot and for ToG-R at 4-shot). Moreover, ToG\u2019s zero-shot\nperformance outpaces ToG-R. This can be attributed to ToG having fully completely explored paths,\nensuring commendable performance even in zero-shot. In contrast, ToG-R omits entities in the path,\nbut its average performance with demonstrations is superior to ToG.\nSearch Algorithm Dataset EM\nNaive Beam SearchCWQ 30.1\nWebQSP 46.1\nTOG-RCWQ 59.2\nWebQSP 75.1\nTOGCWQ 58.8\nWebQSP 76.2\nTable 6: The results of Naive Beam\nSearch, ToG methods on CWQ and We-\nbQSP.Difference with Naive Beam Search ToG is slightly\ndifferent from the beam search.

For each depth of the ToG, we choose\nthe reasoning path with the highest plausibility, to evaluate\nif the current reasoning path is sufficient to answer the\nquestions. The experiment results are shown in Table 6. In\nnaive beam search, the calibration error accumulates along\n17\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 5: Exemplar sensitivity analysis for CWQ and WebQSP for ToG, where \"0\" denotes zero-shot\nand \"k\" denotes k-shot.\nFigure 6: The erroneous instances and categories in the CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA of IO, CoT,\nand ToG.\nthe inference, leading to the instability of the final result.\nWe believe that ToG can partially alleviate this issue by\nconsidering the top- Nreasoning paths.\nB.2 R ESULT ANALYSIS\nWe conduct a detailed analysis on the answers generated by ToG and ToG-R.\nError Analysis We considered three types of errors: (1) Hallucination error, (2) Refuse error2,\nand (3) Format error. The distribution is shown in Figure 6. Our approach has significantly reduced\nthe hallucination and refusal to answer error types in IO and CoT. For GrailQA, ToG even reduces\nthese types of errors by 50% and 60%, respectively. Moreover, in ToG\u2019s error samples, there are\nstill many instances of hallucination and refusal to answer errors. This is because the current search\ndepth and width are both set to 3. By increasing the search depth and width, these error instances\nwill further decrease (refer to Section 3.2.3). Furthermore, we currently generalize incorrect answers\nas hallucinations, but there are various categories within hallucinations, which we won\u2019t discuss in\nthis paper. Additionally, after applying ToG, there\u2019s a slight increase in samples with format errors.\nThis result shows that the explored paths lead to a noticeable increase in the tokens, sometimes even\nexceeding the maximum output limit. However, the error rate from this issue is negligible (less than\n3%).\nEvidence of Answers We conducted an analysis of the correctly answered samples in three datasets\nto investigate the evidence for LLM in generating answers as shown in Figure 7. Evidently, a\nsignificant portion of the answers are derived from the paths explored by ToG, while roughly 20%\nrely exclusively on the intrinsic knowledge embedded within LLM\u2019s parameters for generating\nresponses. It is worth noting that around 7% of the correctly answered samples require a combination\n2LLM will refuse to answer due to lack of information.\n18\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nof knowledge from both the explored paths and LLM\u2019s inherent knowledge (as elaborated in Appendix\nTable 21). This distinction sets our approach apart from traditional graph-based search methods, as it\ndoes not necessitate the path to encompass the node containing the correct answer entirely. Instead,\nthe explored paths supplement and reference LLM\u2019s inherent knowledge. The distribution of answer\ntypes for ToG-R is almost indistinguishable from that of ToG, proving the robustness of our approach.\nFigure 7: The proportions of ToG\u2019s evidence of answers on CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA datasets.\nFigure 8: The explored path overlap ratio of ToG-R on CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA datasets.\nThe Overlap Ratio between the Explored Paths and Ground-truth Paths We also conduct an\nanalysis of the correctly answered samples in three datasets to investigate the ratio of overlap between\nthe paths explored by ToG and the ground-truth path in SPARQL. The definition of overlap ratio is\nthe ratio of overlapping paths to the total number of relations in ground-truth SPARQL:\nCount (Rel(Paths)\u2229Rel(SPARQL ))\nCount (Rel(SPARQL ))\nwhere Rel(*) denotes all the unduplicated relations in the \"*\" and Count(*) denotes the number\nof \"*\"3. Figure 9 is a path schematic which takes the case shown in Table 22 for example. It can\nbe observed from Figure 10 that the paths explored by ToG are identical to the golden paths of an\naverage of 30% correct samples, while the paths of an average of 21% correct samples are completely\ndifferent from the golden path. This indicates that ToG has successfully explored a completely and\napproximately new path in the knowledge graph space to reach the final answer entity. For ToG-R,\nthe disparity between the two is primarily evident in the CWQ dataset, where the percentage of\nintervals (25,50] in ToG results is quite significant (nearly 40%), whereas ToG-R results tend to be\nmore evenly distributed as shown in Figure 11. We contend that this discrepancy arises from the\ndisregard of entity, thereby enhancing the diversity of explored relations. This represents a significant\napplication of knowledge graph reasoning in academic research.\nThe Reasoning Depth of Questions We calculate the reasoning depth of testing questions based on\nthe number of relations within their ground-truth SPARQL queries on CWQ and WebQSP. The counts\n3We approximately calculate the length of a path by counting the number of relations in the ground-truth\nSPARQL.\n19\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 9: Path schematic to calculate overlap.\nFigure 10: The explored path overlap ratio of ToG on CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA datasets.\nFigure 11: The path overlap ratio of ToG-R on CWQ, WebQSP, and GrailQA datasets.\nFigure 12: The lengths of the ground-truth SPARQL queries within the CWQ and WebQSP datasets,\ncomputed based on relation numbers.\n20\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nFigure 13: ToG, ToG-R and CoT\u2019s performance among CWQ and WebQSP dataset.\nof questions with different reasoning depths are shown in Figure 12. We analyze the performances\nof ToG, ToG-R, and CoT on testing questions of both datasets with different reasoning depths. As\nillustrated in Figure 13, the performances of CoT show roughly decreasing trends on both datasets,\nwith the reasoning depth of testing questions increasing. Conversely, ToG and ToG-R can partially\ncounteract the performance degradation caused by the increment of reasoning depths of questions,\nespecially on CWQ. Generally, the performance difference between ToG and CoT becomes more\nsignificant on deeper questions.\nB.2.1 E FFICIENCY OF TOG\nThere are many solutions to improve efficiency and reduce the computational complexity (proportional\nto the number of calling LLMs) of ToG from the original O(ND)toO(D), where Dis the depth (or\nequivalently length) of the reasoning path, and Nis the width of the beam-search (how many paths\nare remained in the pool in each iteration).\nSolution 1 Reducing computational complexity from O(ND)toO(D)by using lightweight model\nin pruning. The bottleneck of computation is the pruning step, which contributes to N\u2217Dtimes\ncalling, and it is important to optimize it for computational efficiency. A technical route is to replace\nLLM with small models such as BM25 and Sentence-BERT in the pruning step since the small\nmodels are much faster than LLM calling. In this way, we can reduce the number of LLM calling\nfrom2ND+D+1toD+1. When D=3, for example, there are only 4 times LLM calling. However,\nthis optimization sacrifices the accuracy due to the weaker scoring model in pruning. For instance,\nas shown in Table 5 of the manuscript, the performance of ToG on WebQSP drops from 76.2%\nto 66.3% after replacing ChatGPT with SentenceBERT for pruning. To alleviate the issue of the\nperformance degradation, we can appropriately increase the search width to compensate the loss\nbecause increasing search width can improve the chance of the optimal path to be selected in the pool\nand it doesn\u2019t affect the number of LLM calling. To empirically verify this, we increase the search\nwidth from 3 to 5 and reevaluate ToG with SentenceBERT as the pruning model on WebQSP. The\naccuracy rises to from 66.3% to 68.5% and could be further improved with a greater width since the\ngreater width would not cause an increase in the number of LLM calls.\nSolution 2 Reducing computational complexity from O(ND)toO(D)by unifying the prompts in\nthe same pruning step. Another solution on speeding up the pruning step is to employ the LLM at\nonce to score all components of N candidate sets for obtaining top-N candidates, instead of calling\nthe LLM N times to score N candidate sets separately. Through this solution, either entity pruning\nstep or relation pruning step only need 1 LLM call for each iteration. Thus, the maximum number of\nLLM calls per question needed for ToG and ToG-R would drop to 2D+D+ 1andD+D+ 1.\nSolution 3 Optimizing pruning step to make the actual calls of LLMs much less than the previously\nestimated 2ND+D+ 1and closer to some common prompting methods such as CoT-SC. For ToG\nand other LLM-based methods, the computational time (cost or complexity) in the inference phase\nmainly depends on how many times calling LLM. For each question, ToG needs at most 2ND+D+1\ntimes. Meanwhile, ToG-R needs at most ND+D+ 1times as mentioned in Section 2.\nGiven the beam search width Nand maximal reasoning depth D, ToG\u2019s initialize the search from\nthe entity mostly aligning with the keyword in question. In each iterative step of the reasoning path,\n21\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\nDataset CWQ WebQSP GrailQA QALD10-EN SimpleQuestion\nAverage LLM Calls 14.3 11.2 10.4 11.4 8.7\nTable 7: Average Number of LLM Calls per Question (Part 1)\nDataset WebQuestion T-REx Zero-Shot RE Creak\nAverage LLM Calls 10.5 7.7 7.6 8.0\nTable 8: Average Number of LLM Calls per Question (Part 2)\nToG starts from each of the Nentities/relations (nodes/edges on knowledge graph) and searches\nall its neighboring relations/entities. Given the search width N, ToG always keep N\"most-likely\"\ncandidate reasoning paths in the pool, and thus there are always Ncandidate entity sets ED\ncand,n and\nNcandidate relation sets RD\ncand,n . Consequently, it needs NLLM calls for entity pruning and N\ncalls for relation pruning, respectively, as well as one additional LLM call for reasoning (evaluating if\nthe information from the current candidate paths are enough or not). We have to point it out that, for\neach of the Nstarting entities, all its neighbor entities/relations are NOT scored one by one. On the\ncontrary, all its neighbor entities/relations are \"translated\" into \"one\" prompt altogether and are sent to\nLLM, which output the top- Ncandidates at one-time. Therefore, each starting entity only calls LLM\nonce for pruning and so Nstarting entities calls LLM Ntimes in one iterative step. Consequently,\nthere are totally 2ND+Dtimes calling after reasoning Dsteps. In the end, there is an additional\ncalling that \"translate\" the final path to user-understandable language and answer the user. Therefore,\nToG requires 2ND+D+ 1LLM calls in total. Since most questions can be answered within 3 hops\n(means depth of reasoning path is 3), and the performance is usually good enough when the search\nwidth N=3 as we tested in Figure 3, the total number of LLM calling is 2\u00d73\u00d73 + 3 + 1 = 22 . So\nthe computational time is about 21 times longer than that of LLM-only. With a similar performance\nto ToG, its variant ToG-R only calls LLM for ND+D+ 1times by using random entity pruning\ninstead of LLM-based entity pruning, saving nearly half of computational time.\n2ND+D+ 1 is the maximal computational complexity. In most cases, ToG does not need\n2ND+D+ 1LLM calls for a question because the whole reasoning process might be early stopped\nbefore the maximum reasoning depth D is reached if LLM determines enough information has been\nretrieved. Likewise, ToG-R does not really need ND+D+ 1LLM calls in most cases. As an\nillustration, Table 7 and Table 8 show the average numbers of LLM calls per question needed by ToG\non different datasets. It can be seen that in the four multi-hop KBQA datasets, the average numbers\nof LLM calls (ranging from 10 to 15) are significantly smaller than 22, which is the theoretical\nmaximum number of LLM calls calculated from 2ND+D+ 1when N=3 and D=3.

We compared ToG with IO, CoT and the New Bing search engine4. We have selected\nfour examples for analysis, each with top-3 reasoning paths and normalized scores.\nIn the first example in Table 19, ToG initially identifies \"Arthur Miller\" and \"Lucian\", in the question\nand subsequently expands its reasoning path through the Exploration andReasoning processes.\nAfter conducting two iterations of the search, ToG successfully arrived at the correct answer, as it\nlinks the two entities with the reasoning path, which represents the perfect route for locating solutions.\nAdditionally, the presence of UnName_Entity in the intermediate steps of reasoning paths, reflects\nthe incompleteness of the knowledge graph (i.e., some entities lack the \"name\" relation). However,\nToG is still capable of performing the next reasoning step, as all available relations contain relevant\ninformation. We observe that IO and CoT do not answer the query correctly since they lack the\nappropriate knowledge, and New Bing do not retrieve the appropriate information during the retrieval\nprocess.\nIn the second example shown in Table 20, IO prompt and CoT even New Bing suffer from a\nhallucination issue and provide an erroneous answer, \"Florida\", since the \"Renegade\" is the mascot\nof \"Florida State Seminoles\" instead of \"fight song\". ToG obtain the reasoning path \"Renegade\" \u2192\n\"sports.fight_song.sports_team\" \u2192\"Pittsburgh Steeler\". However, this reasoning path does not lead\nto a final answer, but combined with LLMs\u2019, ToG can answer the correct answer \"Pennsylvania\".\nThe third example in Table 21 demonstrates an example of the ToG-R, where ToG ignores the\nintermediate entities and focuses on the information in the relations instead. After two-hop of\nreasoning to \"Harvard College\", combined with LLMs\u2019, ToG gives the final result: \"Massachusetts\".\nIt can be observed that IO and CoT do not have background knowledge, and New Bing answers the\nquestion correctly since it retrieves the correct information.\nThe final example is shown in Table 22. Where ToG generates a reasoning path to\nthe final question (Path 1). Notably, the Ground-Truth reasoning path for the answer is\nsports.sports_team.team_mascot \u2192base.schemastaging.team_training_ground_relationship.facility\n4Accessed version July 2023.\n25\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2024\n\u2192base.schemastaging.sports_team_extra.training_ground (retrievable from the SPARQL), which is\nmore hop than ToG. The ToG enables the exploration of new reasoning paths to reach the correct an-\nswer, which represents a significant application of knowledge graph reasoning. However, the answer\nto the current question in the KB, is \"Bright House Field\", which is incorrect since \"Philadelphia\nPhillies\" training stadium is \"Spectrum Field\" now. This example exemplifies a constraint of ToG,\nspecifically its dependence on the correctness of the KB, where the incorrect KB has negative impact\non ToG\u2019s reasoning accuracy. However, as depicted in Figure 4, ToG presents a novel framework to\nconstruct automated knowledge infusion to the KG.\nQuestion Who influenced Arthur Miller that was influenced by Lucian?\nReasoning\nPathsArthur Miller \u2192influence.influence_node.influenced_by \u2192William Shake-\nspeare \u2192influence.influence_node.influenced_by \u2192Lucian.

        "text": "Delphic Costs and Benefits in Web Search: A\nutilitarian and historical analysis\n(Preliminary extended abstract)\nAndrei Z. Broder & Preston McAfee\nGoogle Research\nMountain View, CA\nbroder@acm.org, prestonmcafee@gmail.com\nAugust 16, 2023\nAbstract\nWe present a new framework to conceptualize and operationalize\nthe total user experience of search, by studying the entirety of a search\njourney from an utilitarian point of view.\nWeb search engines are widely perceived as \u201cfree\u201d. But search\nrequires time and effort: in reality there are many intermingled non-\nmonetary costs (e.g. time costs, cognitive costs, interactivity costs) and\nthe benefits may be marred by various impairments, such as misun-\nderstanding and misinformation. This characterization of costs and\nbenefits appears to be inherent to the human search for information\nwithin the pursuit of some larger task: most of the costs and im-\npairments can be identified in interactions with any web search engine,\ninteractions with public libraries, and even in interactions with ancient\noracles. To emphasize this innate connection, we call these costs and\nbenefits Delphic , in contrast to explicitly financial costs and benefits.\nOur main thesis is that users\u2019 satisfaction with a search engine\nmostly depends on their experience of Delphic cost and benefits, in\nother words on their utility. The consumer utility is correlated with\nclassic measures of search engine quality, such as ranking, precision,\nrecall, etc., but is not completely determined by them. To argue our\nthesis, we catalog the Delphic costs and benefits and show how the\ndevelopment of search engines over the last quarter century, from clas-\nsic Information Retrieval roots to the integration of Large Language\nModels, was driven to a great extent by the quest of decreasing Delphic\ncosts and increasing Delphic benefits.\nWe hope that the Delphic costs framework will engender new ideas\nand new research for evaluating and improving the web experience for\neveryone.\n1arXiv:2308.07525v1  [cs.IR]  15 Aug 2023\nIntroduction\nTwenty five centuries ago, seekers of information rich enough to take a trip\nto Mount Parnassus could ask Pythia, the Delphi temple high priestess,\nwhatever they wanted to know about the past, the present, and the future.\nPythias have been out of business for a long time but, as Julia Kindt has\nobserved in a delightful essay [4] that inspired this paper, Google and other\nsearch engines are modern substitutes. Kindt noted that \u201cAs with the an-\ncient oracles, answers provided [by search engines] are only ever as good as\nthe question asked\u201d .\nHere we investigate other similarities: Like the Delphic oracle, web search\nengines do not demand any direct payments (and thus are widely perceived\nas \u201cfree\u201d), but using them requires time and effort. More generally, current\nseekers incur costs and obtain benefits in the pursuit of a background task,\nsame as their antique predecessors. Of course, the modern costs are much\nlower, but we can identify costs of a similar type across eons. Furthermore,\nnow as then, different people that make identical queries and get identical\nresults might experience vastly different costs and benefits depending on\ntheir specific situation: for example, people with good domain knowledge\nmight value a result that is incomprehensible to those without it.\nConsumers incur many intermingled costs to search: access costs (for a\nsuitable device and internet bandwidth), cognitive costs (to formulate and\nreformulate the query, parse the search result page, choose relevant results,\netc), interactivity costs (to type, scroll, view, click, listen, and so on), and\nobviously for all of these activities plus waiting for results and processing\nthem, time costs totask completion .\nIn addition, the benefits of search are highly dependent of the searcher\u2019s\ncontext (e.g. location, expertise level, prior domain knowledge, and their\nend task) and might be marred by impairments , another type of cost, in\nthe form of miscommunication (the search agent misunderstanding the user\nintent due, for instance, to user error or inherent ambiguity), misrepre-\nsentation (sites not delivering their promises, e.g. false advertising or click\nbait), misinformation (incorrect, outdated, or incomplete information), dis-\ninformation (intentional misinformation) and misinterpretation (due e.g. to\nuser\u2019s language or reading-level mismatch). Results might have quality flaws\n(e.g. sites that themselves have large cognitive or interactive costs, sites that\nprovide sub-par services, etc) and in particular safety flaws (e.g. sites that\nmisuse or leak private information or harbor viruses). Other potential im-\npairments to the user experience and/or reductions in value are distrust (the\nfear, whether founded or not, that the content presented is flawed, or that\n2\nthe site is unsafe) and discomfort (in reaction to upsetting content).\nIn addition to access, cognitive, interactivity, and time costs, search\npresents a privacy trade-off similar to the choice between using a credit\ncard or paying cash: cash is more private but cards are more convenient.\nSearchers inevitably reveal what they are seeking but can use mechanisms\nsuch as history deletion, anonymous surfing, location hiding, VPN, etc. to\nreduce the amount of data they share. These choices however increase other\ncosts and may reduce functionality. For instance: a query like \u201ccoffee shops\nnear me\u201d is not solvable if the location is hidden (or increases time and\ninteractivity costs if the location needs to be made explicit every time); the\nuse of search history improves the search results; most legitimate VPNs are\nnot free and also increase both latency and access costs.\nTurning now to benefits: Consumers search because they want to com-\nplete tasks, and the queries they make represent steps towards their goals.\nThus the ultimate value provided by search engines is whatever help they\nprovide towards task completion . However, most of the time the task is un-\nknown and/or the search engines can not offer any help beyond trying to\ninfer and respond to the query intent .\nClassic information retrieval is predicated on queries made due to an\ninformational need [9] necessary for the task at hand, but the intent of web\nqueries is not always informational: a still popular 2002 taxonomy of web\nqueries by intent [2] (devised by one of the authors) identifies three broad\ncategories: (1) Navigational (the intent is to reach a particular site); (2)\nInformational (the intent is to acquire some information); and (3) Trans-\nactional (the intent is to perform some web-mediated activity). For the\npurposes of this paper it is fitting to carve out (4) Hedonic intent (seeking\nentertainment, social interaction, or other forms of leisure directly provided\non the web) from other transactional queries, since in this case the total\ntime to task completion is not necessarily a cost, and the search engine can\nin fact fulfill the task entirely, rather than provide information that helps a\nuser do it.\nBesides online entertainment, there are numerous situations where search\nengines can go beyond the immediate query intent to facilitate the task\ncompletion. For instance, a search on Google for a landmark typically offers\nlinks to directions; clicking on that link, leads to a map, where the searcher\ncan book a car service with the pick-up and drop-off addresses already filled.\nCompared to cut and paste addresses, and dealing with multiple apps, this\nscenario offers a significant reduction in the interactivity and time costs\nrequired for the corresponding task completion. Similar examples of such\nfacilitations include having food or goods delivered, buying tickets to a\n3\nmovie, and making restaurant reservations.\nThis characterization of total costs and benefits appears to be inherent\nto the human search for information: most of the costs can be identified in\ninteractions with any web search engine, interactions with public libraries,\nand even in interactions with ancient oracles. To emphasize this innate\nconnection we call these costs and benefits Delphic , in contrast to explicitly\nmonetary costs and benefits. Delphic costs are akin to transaction costs [10]\nin economics, but for transactions involving the pursuit of search results\nrather than the exchange of goods and services. Our main thesis is that\nusers\u2019 satisfaction with a search engine mostly depends on their experience of\nDelphic cost and benefits on their way to task completion, in other words on\ntheir utility. This is an instance of a general economics paradigm: in a first\napproximation, consumer behavior is well modeled by assuming consumers\nare utility maximizers, even though consumers rarely make a conscious effort\nto increase their utility. As an example, the Generation Z penchant to use\nTikTok as a general search engine might be explained by the fact that their\ncognitive processing costs for short videos (optimized for mobile viewing\nand their generation\u2019s zeitgeist) is much lower than their cost of crafting\ntext queries and processing conventional web textual results.\nThis \u201cutilitarian\u201d perspective applies not only to text focused search\nengines (e.g. Bing, Google) but also to video search (e.g. YouTube, TikTok),\nproduct search (e.g. Amazon), people search, virtual assistants, etc.\nMost search engines on the web are supported by advertising. As ob-\nserved by Phillip Nelson in 1974, advertising is a form of information[7],\nand hence could be a consumer benefit insofar as the ads are relevant to\ntheir needs and facilitate their task completion: for instance on a product\nsearch, ads specific for that product typically come from stores that have\nthe product in stock and ads for related products are based on deeper un-\nderstanding of the product than what\u2019s readily \u201cknown\u201d to a general search\nengine. Similarly ads often provide deeper (that is, more specific) linking\ninto a provider site than what the search engine provides thus reducing the\ninteractivity cost. Last, but most importantly as a consumer benefit, the\nexistence of ads is what makes search engines \u201cfree\u201d. Furthermore, the ads\nthemselves are ultimately paid from the money that people with sufficient\ndisposable income spend on the products being advertised, thus these people\nsubsidize search for everyone else. On the other hand, irrelevant ads are a\ndistraction and add to the cognitive costs. The well known phenomenon of\n\u201cad blindness\u201d and the wide-spread installation of ad blockers are consumer\ncounter-reactions to irrelevant ads.\nGood ranking, which is necessarily personalized and based on compre-\n4\nhensive query and document understanding, reduces the Delphic costs, in-\ncluding cognitive, interactivity, and time costs. But our second thesis is\nthat algorithmic ranking only partially determines search utility. To wit,\nover the quarter century of web search history, many reductions of Delphic\ncosts were attained by mechanisms unrelated to ranking, but affecting the\nhuman-machine interaction and the quality of results. For example\n\u2022Spelling correction, synonym substitution, query completion, and query\nsuggestions lower the costs of searching. Searchers respond by self-\ncorrecting less often, further increasing the value of these technologies.\n\u2022Assiduous corpus curation (freshness, comprehensiveness, types of con-\ntent, safety checks) mitigates content impairments regardless of rank-\ning.\n\u2022Deeper understanding and more sophisticated processing of content\nallow more accurate query matching thus better ranking, but also bet-\nter snippets, cross-lingual search, and direct navigation to the relevant\npart of the matching page or video thus reducing the cognitive and in-\nteractivity costs.\n\u2022Fast and geographically distributed server farms reduce elapsed time\nand importantly, encourage user query reformulation.\n\u2022Diversity in results (rather than pure ranking maximization) increases\nthe probability of answering ambiguous queries, increasing the Del-\nphic costs for some and reducing for others. Additional user-feedback\ncontrols, e.g. \u201cMore like this\u201d or \u201cMore from this site\u201d buttons, make\nit easy for the user to reduce diversity when desired, thus reducing\nDelphic costs overall.\n\u2022For more than a century it has been said that \u201c[a] picture is worth 1000\nwords\u201d [1]. Early in the web history, search result pages were almost\nentirely text, but in time they increasingly incorporated multi-media,\nthus reducing both the interactivity and cognitive load while raising\nthe time and bandwidth costs. In the reverse direction \u201ca camera is\nthe new keyboard\u201d in many contexts (e.g. Pinterest lens, Bing visual\nsearch, Google lens). Similarly, voice search reduces the time and effort\nto formulate a query, especially when no keyboard is available.\n\u2022Modern search engine result pages include types of content that do not\ninvolve ranking at all, such as information extracted from databases\n5\nor knowledge graphs, information capsules purposely authored by ex-\nperts, and answers to related questions, all buttressed by the ability\nto select news, images, videos, shopping, academic publications, and\nother presentation methods. A significant percentage of Google and\nBing results include such extracted information or \u201crich features\u201d. All\nof these mechanisms reduce the Delphic costs of the users who might\nbe able to find what they need (or reformulate their queries) without\nany further processing of the traditional results.\n\u2022Users develop search strategies to reduce their personal Delphic costs.\nSuch strategies are persistent and Delphic cost reduction faces a trade-\noff between optimizing for existing strategies and promoting new, more\nefficient ones.\nThe trend towards facilitating task completion coupled on one hand with\nmajor scientific advances in Natural Language Processing and Voice Recog-\nnition, and on the other hand, the explosive proliferation of smart phones\nled in early 2010\u2019s to the emergence of virtual assistants [11], such as Ama-\nzon\u2019s Alexa, Apple\u2019s Siri, Google\u2019s Assistant, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and Sam-\nsung\u2019s Bixby. These assistants use voice as a primary mode of interaction,\nand sometimes are known as \u201cvoice assistants\u201d. Although they offer some\nlimited search capabilities, in particular factoid elicitation, their main goal\nis to complete a task, either on the mobile device (e.g. add a reminder, set\nan alarm, send a text, play some music) or via a connected \u201csmart\u201d devices\nlike a thermostat, window shade, security alarm or door lock.\nFrom the point of view of Delphic costs, the voice interface that char-\nacterizes virtual assistants reduce interactivity costs for very short queries\nbut make long queries difficult and in either case the risk of miscommuni-\ncation is quite high. The task completion capabilities are popular but for\nnow the underlying tasks are rather simple so the total time savings are\nlimited. Nevertheless, according to E-marketer [3], in 2022 about 42% of\nthe US population reported using a voice assistant in the last month.\nOver the past year, there has been a dramatic growth in the use of\nGenerative and Interactive AI (\u201dchatbots\u201d) for search, either as complements\nto traditional web search engines (e.g. Google, \u201cNew Bing\u201d) or as standalone\nsolutions (e.g. OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Anthropic\u2019s Claude). This is a rapidly\nchanging landscape; nevertheless the impact of chatbots on Delphic costs is\nobvious, extensive, and offers a good explanation for the chatbots\u2019 immediate\nsuccess.\nSome features of chatbots increase Delphic benefits and reduce Delphic\ncosts:\n6\n\u2022Chatbots can save time and effort both on the crafting of the query\nand on the processing of results. On input, chatbots enable users to\nexpress their intent in a natural form followed by interactive emenda-\ntions, reducing both the cognitive and interactivity costs of classical\nweb search. On output, for certain queries, chatbots provide short\nresponses that embody knowledge synthesized from numerous and/or\nvoluminous documents. This again significantly reduces cognitive and\ninteractivity overhead, leading to substantial time savings, and overall\nhigher utility.\n\u2022Chatbots have unprecedented and growing capabilities to facilitate\ntask completion. For instance. while a classic search engine might\noffer advice on how to implement bubblesort in python, a chatbot can\nproduce the code, ready for cut and paste. Similarly chatbots are able\nto write stories, poems, novels, and screenplays, and create images,\nspreadsheets, and presentations. Even though in most cases, further\nediting is required, the task facilitation is tremendous.\n\u2022Chatbots have the potential to provide expert answers [5] even to naive\nquestions.\n\u2022Chatbots are naturally better suited to voice interaction, both input\nand output. This is convenient, although it might increase the time to\ntask completion, since for many people typing and reading are faster\nthan speaking and listening.\n\u2022The output can be specified to match the user needs and reduce the\nrisk of misunderstandings (e.g. \u201cexplain in simple english\u201d, \u201cdescribe\nto an expert\u201d, \u201cin a few words\u201d, etc) and since no navigation is needed\noutside of the search engine, the privacy and safety risks are arguably\nlower.\n\u2022Chatbots offer potential hedonic benefits; in simpler words, at least for\nnow, many people are having fun interacting with chatbots whether\nseriously or facetiously [8].\nOther features of chatbots increase Delphic costs or reduce the benefits:\n\u2022The access costs will likely increase, since the cost of operating a chat-\nbot is comparatively higher [6]. It is unclear if chatbots can be sup-\nported by advertising: currently Google and \u201cNew Bing\u201d are \u201cfree\u201d,\nbut the premium version of ChatGPT requires a subscription.\n7\n\u2022The latency of the answer is typically much higher than for web search.\nThis is somewhat masked by chatbots \u201ctyping\u201d their answer to simu-\nlate a human interaction, but still apparent.\n\u2022Currently the risk of misinformation is very high, due to \u201challucina-\ntions\u201d and training data issues, in particular substantial delays (rela-\ntive to web search) in incorporating the latest information. For many\npeople this leads to distrust or even discomfort. Furthermore if every\nanswer needs to be checked (as some chatbots suggest) the time gains\nvanish.\nThe very polished look of the chatbots output might induce a false\nperception of reliability: in a notorious case, a highly experienced\nlawyer accepted citations to a bunch of non-existent cases [12] since\nthey seemed entirely plausible.\n*\nWe hope that this paper will engender new ideas for Delphic costs as-\nsessments, the measurement of Delphic costs, and means of reducing these\ncosts. We would like to see the evaluation of web search engines move away\nfrom assessing the quality of ranking in isolation of the users\u2019 overall search\nexperience and personal context towards a holistic evaluation of user utility\nfrom using search engines. Moreover, this \u201cutilitarian analysis\u201d approach,\nrather than pure relevance analysis, could and should be applied to situations\nthat do not involve explicit search, such as content feeds and recommender\nsystems.\nAcknowledgments\n1.

In contrast to traditional\nmedia formats such as news broadcasts, podcasts are typically more\ndiversified in style, format, and topics [ 2]. This calls for methods\nthat are sufficiently general and powerful for modeling heteroge-\nneous podcast data. Podcast content modeling, in particular, embeds\npodcast content in a latent space, facilitating various applications\nthat rely on a general and effective podcast representation space,\nsuch as podcast classification [ 7] and podcast recommendation [ 9].\nExisting works focus on podcast content modeling in a task-\naware supervised setting by learning podcast representations that\ncannot be generalized to different tasks [ 3]. In addition, obtaining\ntask-specific labels is usually difficult and expensive in real-world\nenvironments [ 6,11,14]. Moreover, existing work primarily focuses\non the podcast properties, such as the descriptions, audios, or tran-\nscripts [ 15], while ignoring a variety of important information such\nas the listeners, topics, and heterogeneous relationships between\nthem. In light of these issues, i.e., (1) the non-generalizability of rep-\nresentations, (2) the heavy reliance on labels, and (3) the ignorance\nof heterogeneous relationships, a natural question arises:\nCan we learn podcast representations that can be gener-\nalized to different tasks without labels, while incorporating\nthe heterogeneous relational information?\nTo answer the question, we propose the problem of structural\npodcast content modeling with generalizability, which encodes het-\nerogeneous podcast content with complex structural information\nto learn generalized podcast representations without labels. Since\nprevious research on heterogeneous graph neural networks has\ndemonstrated their effectiveness across different tasks [ 12,13], we\nfirst construct a heterogeneous podcast graph PG by collecting\na large-scale corpus of podcast data from Spotify with inclusive\npodcast content, listener, and topic information. Next, we propose\nPodcast2Vec, a novel self-supervised graph neural network to learn\npodcast representations that are generalizable and effective. Specif-\nically, we design a metapath-based neighbor sampling strategy to\nextract higher-order relations and develop a multi-view relationship\nmodeling framework that considers both intra- and inter-metapath\nviews to capture the complex graph structural information. In par-\nticular, the intra-metapath view enables the model to explore the un-\nderlying node affinity within each metapath, while inter-metapath\nview facilitates the model to capture the path-wise structural in-\nformation across different metapaths. To fully evaluate our model,\nwe conduct experiments on four real-world applications, including\npodcast category classification, user-podcast interest identification,\n710\n\nWWW \u201924 Companion, May 13\u201317, 2024, Singapore, Singapore Yijun Tian, Maryam Aziz, Alice Wang, Enrico Palumbo, and Hugues Bouchard\npodcast recommendation, and long-tail podcast recommendation.\nOur major contributions are as follows:\n\u2022To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to study\ngeneralizable podcast content modeling. In addition, we validate\nand advocate that structural information is vital in encoding\npodcasts, an aspect that has been overlooked in prior studies.\n\u2022To lay the groundwork and pave the way for future research, we\ncollect a new and large-scale corpus of podcast data and construct\na heterogeneous podcast graph.\n\u2022To solve the problem, we propose Podcast2Vec, a novel self-\nsupervised graph neural network to learn podcast representations\nthat are generalizable and effective.\n\u2022Podcast2Vec achieves state-of-the-art performance on four real-\nworld applications.\n2 MODEL\nMetapath-based Neighbor Sampling Strategy. To capture the\nhigher-order proximity and learn comprehensive representations,\nwe propose metapath-based neighbor sampling, which extracts the\nhigher-order relations in a structure-aware manner. Specifically,\ngiven the podcast graph \ud835\udc3a=(\ud835\udc49,\ud835\udc38,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc49,\ud835\udc45,\ud835\udc36,\u03a6)and a metapath\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc491\ud835\udc451\u2212\u2192\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc492\ud835\udc452\u2212\u2192...\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc3f\u2212\u2192\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc3f+1), we use metapath random walk to\nobtain a sequence of nodes based on the following distribution:\n(1\n|\ud835\udc41\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc62)|,(\ud835\udc62,\ud835\udc63)\u2208\ud835\udc38,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc62=\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc59,\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc63=\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc59+1)\n0, otherwise, (1)\nwhere\ud835\udc62represent the \ud835\udc59-th node in the path, \ud835\udc41\ud835\udf19(\ud835\udc62)indicates the\ndirectly connected neighbors of node \ud835\udc62guided by the metapath\n\ud835\udf19. The walk stops when it reaches the maximum length \ud835\udc3f, and\nenables the incorporation of the semantic relationships between\nvarious node types. To preserve the complete higher-order neigh-\nborhood, we create a metapath-based subgraph by connecting each\ncenter podcast node with every other podcast node in the path.\nConsidering each metapath carry different sementics, we generate\nmetapath-based subgraph \ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf19for every metapath \ud835\udf19\u2208\u03a6.\nIntra-metapath Relationship Modeling. The intra-metapath\nrelationship modeling explores the underlying higher-order rela-\ntions of each metapath alone. Specifically, given a metapath-based\nsubgraph\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf19, we first apply a GNN encoder \ud835\udc53(\u00b7;\ud835\udf03)to learn the\nnode representations \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf19under metapath \ud835\udf19and introduce a non-\nlinear layer to transform the learned representations \ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf19and obtain\ntransformed embeddings \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udf19. The process is formulated as follows:\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf19=\ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc3a\ud835\udf19;\ud835\udf03), \ud835\udc4d\ud835\udf19=\ud835\udc4a\u00b7\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udf19+\ud835\udc4f, (2)\nwhere\ud835\udc4arepresents the learnable weight matrix and \ud835\udc4fis the bias\nvector.

From subfigure (a), we observe\nthat the increasing of hidden dimensions improves the performance\nand the model achieves the peak performance at 512, but the further\nincrement leads to overfitting and affects the capacity accordingly.\nThis suggests that the optimal hidden dimensions will result in opti-\nmal model performance. From subfigure (b), we find that equipping\nPodcast2Vec with 2 layers leads to the best performance. We at-\ntribute this improvement to the effective modeling of higher-order\nstructural information encoded in metapaths. However, further\nstacking propagation layers (e.g., 3 or 4 layers) yields overfitting,\nwhich indicates that conducting 2 propagation layers is sufficient\nfor Podcast2Vec to capture the complex structural information.\n3.3 Embedding Visualization\nFor a more intuitive understanding and comparison, we visualize\nthe podcast embeddings for the classification and recommenda-\ntion task in Figure 3 using t-SNE. As shown in the Figure 3 (a),\nPodcast2Vec can clearly identify each category and display a very\nwell-clustered representation space with a clear inter-cluster differ-\nence. This indicates the strong capability of Podcast2Vec in learning\ndiscriminative podcast embeddings. In addition, we randomly se-\nlect 8 user-podcast interaction pairs and visualize their embeddings\nin Figure 3 (b). Ideally, there should be a clear mapping between\neach user-podcast pair (similar to the \u2018king-man=queen-woman\u2019\nrelationship in [ 8]), resulting in parallel lines between different\nclusters. Podcast2Vec can easily divide the users and podcasts into\ntwo condensed clusters and obtain parallel lines for all of the pairs,\nwhich further demonstrates the superiority of our model.\n4 CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we study generalizable podcast content modeling.\nWe assert structural information plays a critical role in encoding\npodcasts. In particular, we collect a new and large scale podcast\ngraph data and develop Podcast2Vec, a novel self-supervised graph\nneural network for structural podcast content modeling. Exten-\nsive experiments on four real-world applications demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed model.\nREFERENCES\n[1]Maryam Aziz, Jesse Anderton, Kevin Jamieson, Alice Wang, Hugues Bouchard,\nand Javed Aslam.

Ruling is an assertion of the will, an\nattempt to exercise control, to shape the world. Public policies are instruments of this\nassertive ambition, and policy studies in the mode that emerged from operations\nresearch during the Second World War were originally envisaged as handmaidens in\nthat ambition. 1There was a distinctly \u2018\u2018high modernist\u2019\u2019 feel to the enterprise, back\nthen: technocratic hubris, married to a sense of mission to make a better world;an overwhelming con Wdence in our ability to measure and monitor that world;\n* We are grateful to Rod Rhodes for invaluable comments on an earlier draft.\n1In recommending continuation of wartime research and development e Vorts into the postwar era,\nCommanding General of the Army Air Force H. H. (\u2018\u2018Hap\u2019\u2019) Arnold had reported to the Secretary of War\nin the following terms: \u2018\u2018During this war the Army, Army Air Forces and the Navy have madeunprecedented use of scienti Wc and industrial resources. The conclusion is inescapable that we have\nnot yet established the balance necessary to insure the continuance of teamwork among the military,\nother government agencies, industry and the universities.\u2019\u2019 Just hear the high modernist ring in the bold\nmission statement adopted by Project RAND in 1948, as it split o Vfrom the Douglas Aircraft Company:\n\u2018\u2018to further and promote scienti Wc, educational and charitable purposes, all for the public welfare and\nsecurity of the United States of America\u2019\u2019 (RAND 2004 ).\nand boundless con Wdence in our capacity actually to pull oV the task of control\n(Scott 1997; Moran 2003).\nHigh modernism in the US and elsewhere have amounted to rule by \u2018\u2018the best and the\nbrightest\u2019\u2019 (Halberstam 1969). It left little room for rhetoric and persuasion, privately\nmuchlesspublicly.Policy problemsweretechnicalquestions,resolvableby thesystematic\napplication of technical expertise. First in the Pentagon, then elsewhere across the wider\npolicy community, the \u2018\u2018art of judgment\u2019\u2019 (Vickers 1983) gave way to the dictates of slide-\nrule e Yciency (Hitch 1958; Hitch and McKean 1960; Haveman and Margolis 1983).\nTraces of that technocratic hubris remain, in consulting houses and IMF missions\nand certain other important corners of the policy universe. But across most of thatworld there has, over the last half-century, been a gradual chastening of the boldest\n\u2018\u2018high modernist\u2019\u2019 hopes for the policy sciences. 2Even in the 1970s, when the high\nmodernist canon still ruled, perceptive social scientists had begun to highlight thelimits to implementation, administration, and control. 3Subsequently, the limits of\nauthority and accountability, of sheer analytic capacity, have borne down upon us.4\nFiasco has piled upon Wasco in some democratic systems (Henderson 1977; Dunleavy\n1981,1995; Bovens and \u2019t Hart 1996). We have learned that many of tools in the \u2018\u2018high\nmodernist\u2019\u2019 kit are very powerful indeed, within limits; but they are strictly limited\n(Hood 1983). We have learned how to supplement those \u2018\u2018high modernist\u2019\u2019 approaches\nwith other \u2018\u2018softer\u2019\u2019 modes for analyzing problems and attempting to solve them.\nIn trying to convey a sense of these changes in the way we have come to approach\npublic policy over the past half-century, the chapters in this Handbook (and still more\nthis Introduction to it) focus on the big picture rather than minute details. There areother books to which readers might better turn for Wne-grained analyses of current\npolicy debates, policy area by policy area. 5There are other books providing more\nWne-grained analyses of public administration. 6This Handbook oVers instead a series\nof connected stories about what it is like, and what it might alternatively be like, tomake and remake public policy in new, more modest modes.\nThis Introduction is o Vered as a scene setter, rather than as a systematic overview\nof the whole Weld of study, much less a potted summary of the chapters that follow.\nOur authors speak most ably for themselves. In this Introduction, we simply dolikewise. And in doing so we try to tell a particular story: a story about the limits of\nhigh ambition in policy studies and policy making, about the way those limits have\nbeen appreciated, about the way more modest ambitions have been formulated, andabout the di Yculties in turn of modest learning. Our story, like all stories, is\ncontestable. There is no single intellectually compelling account available of thestate of either policy making or the policy sciences; but the irredeemable fact of\ncontestability is a very part of the argument of the pages that follow.\n2For a remarkable early send up, see Mackenzie\u2019s ( 1963) \u2018\u2018The Plowden Report: a translation.\u2019\u2019\n3Pressman and Wildavsky 1973; Hood 1976; van Gunsteren 1976.\n4Majone and Quade 1980; Hogwood and Peters 1985; Bovens 1998.\n5The best regular update is probably found in the Brookings Institution\u2019s \u2018\u2018Setting National Priorities\u2019\u2019\nseries; see most recently Aaron and Reischauer ( 1999).\n6Lynn and Wildavsky 1990; Peters and Pierre 2003.4 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\n1. Policy Persuasion\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nWe begin with the most important of all limits to high ambition. All our talk of\n\u2018\u2018making\u2019\u2019 public policy, of \u2018\u2018choosing\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018deciding,\u2019\u2019 loses track of the home truth,\ntaught to President Kennedy by Richard Neustadt ( 1960), that politics and policy\nmaking is mostly a matter of persuasion. Decide, choose, legislate as they will, policymakers must carry people with them, if their determinations are to have the full force\nof policy. That is most commonly demonstrated in systems that attempt to practiceliberal democracy; but a wealth of evidence shows that even in the most coercive\nsystems of social organization there are powerful limits to the straightforward power\nof command (Etzioni 1965).\nTo make policy in a way that makes it stick, policy makers cannot merely issue\nedicts. They need to persuade the people who must follow their edicts if those are to\nbecome general public practice. In part, that involves persuasion of the public at\nlarge: Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s \u2018\u2018bully pulpit\u2019\u2019 is one important lever. In part, the persuasion\nrequired is of subordinates who must operationalize and implement the policies\nhanded down to them by nominal superiors. Truman wrongly pitied \u2018\u2018Poor Ike,\u2019\u2019\nwhom he envisaged issuing orders as if he were in the army, only to Wnd that no one\nwould automatically obey: as it turned out, Ike had a clear idea how to persuade up\nand down the chain of command, even if he had no persuasive presence on television\n(Greenstein 1982). Indeed Eisenhower\u2019s military experience precisely showed that\neven in nominally hierarchical institutions, persuasion lay at the heart of e Vective\ncommand.\nNot only is the practice of public policy making largely a matter of persuasion. So\ntoo is the discipline of studying policy making aptly described as itself being a\n\u2018\u2018persuasion\u2019\u2019 (Reich 1988; Majone 1989). It is a mood more than a science, a loosely\norganized body of precepts and positions rather than a tightly integrated body ofsystematic knowledge, more art and craft than genuine \u2018\u2018science\u2019\u2019 (Wildavsky 1979;\nGoodsell 1992). Its discipline-de Wning title notwithstanding, Lerner and Lasswell\u2019s\npioneering book The Policy Sciences (1951) never claimed otherwise: quite the con-\ntrary, as successive editors of the journal that bears that name continually editorially\nrecall.\nThe cast of mind characterizing policy studies is marked, above all else, by an\naspiration toward \u2018\u2018relevance.\u2019\u2019 Policy studies, more than anything, are academic\nworks that attempt to do the real political work: contributing to the betterment of\nlife, o Vering something that political actors can seize upon and use. From Gunnar\nMyrdal\u2019s American Dilemma (1944) through Charles Murray\u2019s Losing Ground (1984)\nand William Julius Wilson\u2019s Truly Disadvantaged (1987), policy-oriented research on\nrace and poverty has informed successive generations of American policy makers on\nboth ends of the political spectrum, to take only one important example.\nBeyond this stress on relevance, policy studies are distinguished from other sorts of\npolitical science, secondly, by being unabashedly value laden (Lasswell 1951; Reinthe public and its policies 5\n1976; Goodin 1982). They are explicitly normative, in embracing the ineliminable role\nof value premisses in policy choice\u2014and often in forthrightly stating and defending\nthe value premisses from which the policy prescriptions that they make proceed.They are unapologetically prescriptive, in actually recommending certain programs\nand policies over others. Policy studies, Wrst and foremost, give advice about policy;\nand they cannot do that (on pain of the \u2018\u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019\u2019) without basing thatadvice on some normative (\u2018\u2018ought\u2019\u2019) premisses in the Wrst place.\nPolicy studies are distinguished from other sorts of political science, thirdly, by\ntheir action orientation. They are organized around questions of what we as a\npolitical community should do, rather than just around questions of what it should\nbe. Whereas other sorts of political studies prescribe designs for our political insti-\ntutions, as the embodiments or instruments of our collective values, speci Wcally\npolicy studies focus less on institutional shells and more on what we collectively do\nin and through those institutional forms. Policy studies embody a bias toward acts,outputs, and outcomes\u2014a concern with consequences\u2014that contrasts with the\nformal-institutional orientation of much of the rest of political studies.\nThese apparently commonplace observations\u2014that policy studies is a \u2018\u2018persuasion\u2019\u2019\nthat aspires to normatively committed intervention in the world of action\u2014pose\npowerful challenges for the policy analyst. One of the greatest challenges concerns\nthe language that the analyst can sensibly use. The professionalization of political\nscience in the last half-century has been accompanied by a familiar development\u2014the\ndevelopment of a correspondingly professional language. Political scientists know\nwhom they are talking to when they report Wndings: they are talking to each other, and\nthey naturally use language with which other political scientists are familiar. They are\ntalking to each other because the scienti Wc world of political science has a recursive\nquality: the task is to communicate with, and convince, like-minded professionals, interms that make sense to the professional community. Indeed some powerful tradi-\ntions in purer forms of academic political science are actually suspicious of \u2018\u2018rele-\nvance\u2019\u2019 in scholarly enquiry (Van Evera 2003). The Wndings and arguments of\nprofessional political science may seep into the world of action, but that is not themain point of the activity. Accidental seepage is not good enough for policy studies. It\nharks back to an older world of committed social enquiry where the precise object is to\nunify systematic social investigation with normative commitment\u2014and to report\nboth the results and the prescriptions in a language accessible to \u2018\u2018non-professionals.\u2019\u2019These can range from engaged\u2014or not very engaged\u2014citizens to the elite of policy\nmakers. Choosing the language in which to communicate is therefore a tricky, but\nessential, part of the vocation of policy analysis.\nOne way of combining all these insights about how policy making and policy studies\nare essentially about persuasion is through the \u2018\u2018argumentative turn\u2019\u2019 and the analysis of\n\u2018\u2018discourses\u2019\u2019 of policy in the \u2018\u2018critical policy studies\u2019\u2019 movement (Fischer and Forrester\n1993; Hajer 1995; Hajer and Wagenaar 2003). On this account, a positivist or \u2018\u2018high\nmodernist\u2019\u2019 approach, either to the making of policy or to the understanding ofhow it is made, that tries to decide what to do or what was done through vaguelymechanical-style causal explanations is bound to fail, or anyway be radically incomplete.6 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nPolicy analysts are never mere \u2018\u2018handmaidens to power.\u2019\u2019 It is part of their job, and a\nrole that the best of them play well, to advocate the policies that they think right\n(Majone 1989). The job of the policy analyst is to \u2018\u2018speak truth to power\u2019\u2019 (Wildavsky\n1979), where the truths involved embrace not only the hard facts of positivist science\nbut also the re Xexive self-understandings of the community both writ large (the\npolity) and writ small (the policy community, the community of analysts).\nIt may well be that this re Xexive quality is the main gift of the analyst to\nthe practitioner. In modern government practitioners are often forced to live inan unre Xective world: the very pressure of business compresses time horizons,\nobliterating recollection of the past and foreshortening anticipation of thefuture (Neustadt and May 1986). There is overwhelming pressure to decide, and\nthen to move on to the next problem. Self-consciousness about the limits of decision,and about the setting, social and historical, of decision, is precisely what the\nanalyst can bring to the policy table, even if its presence at the table often seemsunwelcome.\nOf course, reason giving has always been a central requirement of policy applica-\ntion, enforced by administrative law. Courts automatically overrule administrative\norders accompanied by no reasons. So, too, will their \u2018\u2018rationality review\u2019\u2019\nstrike down statutes which cannot be shown to serve a legitimate purpose within\nthe power of the state (Fried 2004 ,208\u201312). The great insight of the argumentative turn\nin policy analysis is that a robust process of reason giving runs throughout all stages ofpublic policy. It is not just a matter of legislative and administrative window dressing.\nFrank and fearless advice is not always welcomed by those in positions of power.\nAll organizations Wnd self-evaluation hard, and states Wnd it particularly hard: there\nis a long and well-documented history of states, democratic and non-democratic,\nignoring or even punishing the conveyor of unwelcome truths (Van Evera 2003).\nEstablished administrative structures that used to be designed to generate dispas-sionate advice are increasingly undermined with the politicization of science and the\npublic service (UCS 2004 ; Peters and Pierre 2004 ). Still, insofar as policy analysis\nconstitutes a profession with an ethos of its own, the aspiration to \u2018\u2018speak truth topower\u2019\u2019\u2014even, or especially, unwelcome truths\u2014must be its prime directive, its\nequivalent of the Hippocratic Oath (ASPA 1984).\n2. Arguing versus Bargaining\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nOur argument thus far involves modest claims for the \u2018\u2018persuasion\u2019\u2019 of policy studies,\nbut even these modest ambitions carry their own hubristic dangers. Persuasion; the\nencouragement of a re Xexive, self-conscious policy culture; an attention to the\nlanguage used to communicate with the world of policy action: all are important.But all run the risk of losing sight of a fundamental truth\u2014that policy is not onlythe public and its policies 7\nabout arguing, but is also about bargaining. A policy forum is not an academic\nseminar. The danger is that we replicate the fallacy of a tradition which we began by\nrejecting.\nPolicy analysts, particularly those who see themselves as part of a distinct high\nmodernist professional cadre, often take a technocratic approach to their work. Theysee themselves as possessing a neutral expertise to be put to the service of any\npolitical master. They accept that their role as adviser is to advise, not to choose;\nand they understand that it is in the nature of advice that it is not always taken.\nAccepting all this as they do, policy advisers of this more professional, technocratic\ncast of mind inevitably feel certain pangs of regret when good advice is overridden\nfor bad (\u2018\u2018purely political\u2019\u2019) reasons.\nPolitics may rightly seem disreputable when it is purely a matter of power in the\nservice of interests. When there is nothing more to be said on behalf of the outcome\nthan that people who prefer it have power enough to force it, one might fatalisticallyaccept that outcome as politically inevitable without supposing that there is anything\nat all to be said for it normatively. Certainly there is not much to be said for it\nnormatively, anyway, without saying lots more about why the satisfaction of those\npreferences is objectively desirable or why that distribution of power is proper.\nNor is this account necessarily incompatible with some conception of democratic\npolicy making. Indeed some democratic theorists try to supply the needed normative\nglue by analogizing political competition to the economic market. The two funda-\nmental theorems of welfare economics prove Adam Smith\u2019s early speculation\nthat, at least under certain (pretty unrealistic) conditions, free competition in themarketplace for goods would produce maximum possible satisfaction of people\u2019s\npreferences (Arrow and Hahn 1971). Democratic theorists after the fashion of\nSchumpeter ( 1950) say the same about free competition in the political marketplace\nfor ideas and public policies (Coase 1974). \u2018\u2018Partisan mutual adjustment\u2019\u2019\u2014between\nparties, between bureaucracies, between social partners\u2014can, bargaining theorists ofpolitics and public administration assure us, produce socially optimal results (Lind-\nblom 1965).\nOf course there are myriad assumptions required for the proofs to go through, and\nthey are met even less often in politics than economics. (Just think of the assumption\nof \u2018\u2018costless entry of new suppliers:\u2019\u2019 a heroic enough assumption for producers in\neconomic markets, but a fantastically heroic one as applied to new parties in politicalmarkets, especially in a world of \u2018\u2018cartelized\u2019\u2019 party markets (Katz and Mair 1995).)\nMost importantly, though, the proofs only demonstrate that preferences are max-imally satis Wed in the Pareto sense: no one can be made better o Vwithout someone\nelse being made worse o V. Some are inevitably more satis Wed than others, and who is\nmost satis Wed depends on who has most clout\u2014money in the economic market, or\npolitical power in the policy arena. So the classic \u2018\u2018proof\u2019\u2019 of the normative legitimacyof political bargaining is still lacking one crucial leg, which would have to be some\njustiWcation for the distribution of power that determines \u2018\u2018who bene Wts\u2019\u2019 (Page\n1983). The early policy scientists clearly knew as much, recalling Lasswell\u2019s ( 1950)\ndeWnition of \u2018\u2018politics\u2019\u2019 in terms of \u2018\u2018who gets what, when, how?\u2019\u20198 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nThe success of that enterprise looks even more unlikely when re Xecting, as\nobservers of public policy inevitably must, on the interplay between politics and\nmarkets (Lindblom 1977; Dahl 1985). The point of politics is to constrain markets: if\nmarkets operated perfectly (according to internal economic criteria, and broader\nsocial ones), we would let all social relations be determined by them alone. It is only\nbecause markets fail in one or the other of those ways, or because they fail to provide\nthe preconditions for their own success, that we need politics at all (Hirsch 1976;OVe\n1984; Esping-Andersen 1985; World Bank 1997). But if politics is to provide these\nnecessary conditions for markets, politics must be independent of markets\u2014whereas\nthe interplay of \u2018\u2018political money\u2019\u2019 and the rules of property in most democracies\nmeans that politics is, to a large extent, the captive of markets (Lindblom 1977).\nTainted though the processes of representative democracy might be by political\nmoney, they nonetheless remain the principal mechanism of public accountability\nfor the exercise of public power. Accountability through economic markets andinformal networks can usefully supplement the political accountability of elected\noYcials to the electorate; but can never replace it (Day and Klein 1987; Goodin 2003).\nAnother strand of democratic theory has recently emerged, reacting against the\nbargaining model that sees politics as simply the vector sum of political forces and the\naggregation of votes. It is a strand which is easier to reconcile with the \u2018\u2018persuasive\u2019\u2019\ncharacter of policy studies. Deliberative democrats invite us to re Xect together on our\npreferences and what policies might best promote the preferences that we re Xectively\nendorse (Dryzek 2000 ). There are many arenas in which this might take place. Those\nrange from small-scale forums (such as \u2018\u2018citizen\u2019s juries,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018consensus conferences,\u2019\u2019 or\n\u2018\u2018Deliberative Polls\u2019\u2019 involving between 20and200citizens) through medium-sized\nassociations (Fung and Wright 2001). Ackerman and Fishkin ( 2004 ) even make a\nproposal for a nationwide \u2018\u2018Deliberation Day\u2019\u2019 before every national election.\nNot only might certain features of national legislature make that a more \u2018\u2018delibera-\ntive\u2019\u2019 assembly, more in line with the requirements of deliberative democracy (Steiner\net al. 2005). And not only are certain features of political culture\u2014traditions of free\nspeech and civic engagement\u2014more conducive to deliberative democracy (Sunstein1993,2001; Putnam 1993). Policy itself might be made in a more \u2018\u2018deliberative\u2019\u2019 way, by\nthose charged with the task of developing and implementing policy proposals (Fischer2003). That is the aim of advocates of critical policy studies, with their multifarious\nproposals for introducing a \u2018\u2018deliberative turn\u2019\u2019 into the making of policies on every-\nthing from water use to urban renewal to toxic waste (Hajer and Wagenaar 2003).\nSome might say that this deliberative turn marks a shift from reason to rhetoric in\npolicy discourse. And in a way, advocates of that turn might embrace the description,\nfor part of the insight of the deliberative turn is that reason is inseparable from the\nwaywe reason: rhetoric is not decoration but is always ingrained in the intellectual\ncontent of argument. Certainly they mean to disempower the dogmatic deliverancesof technocratic reason, and to make space in the policy-making arena for softer and\nless hard-edged modes of communication and assessment (Young 2000 ; Fischer\n2003). Reframing the problem is, from this perspective, a legitimate part of the\nprocess: it is important to see that the problem looks di Verent from di Verentthe public and its policies 9\nperspectives, and that di Verent people quite reasonably bring di Verent perspectives\nto bear (March 1972; Sch o\u00a8n and Rein 1994; Allison and Zelikow 1999). Value clari W-\ncation, and re-envisioning our interests (personal and public), is to be seen as a\nlegitimate and valued outcome of political discussions, rather than as an awkward-\nness that gets in the way of technocratic Wtting of means to pre-given ends. Thus the\ndeliberative turn echoes one of the key features of the \u2018\u2018persuasive\u2019\u2019 conception ofpolicy studies with which we began: re Xexivity is\u2014or should be\u2014at the heart of both\nadvice and decision.\nThese conceptions, true, are easier to realize in some settings than in others. The\nplace, the institutional site, and the time, all matter. National traditions clearly di Ver\nin their receptivity to deliberation and argument. The more consultative polities of\nScandinavia and continental Europe have always favoured more consensual modes of\npolicy making, compared to the majoritarian polities of the Anglo-American world\n(Lijphart 1999). Votes are taken, in the end. But the process of policy development\nand implementation proceeds more according to procedures of \u2018\u2018sounding out\u2019\u2019\nstakeholders and interested parties, rather than majorities pressing things to a vote\nprematurely (Olsen 1972b). Of course, every democratic polity worth the name has\nsome mechanisms for obtaining public input into the policy-making process: lettersto Congressmen and congressional hearings, in the USA; Royal Commissions and\nGreen Papers in the UK; and so on. But those seem to be pale shadows of the\nScandinavian \u2018\u2018remiss\u2019\u2019 procedures, inviting comment on important policy initiatives\nand actually taking the feedback seriously, even when it does not necessarily come\nfrom powerful political interests capable of blocking the legislation or derailing itsimplementation (Meijer 1969; Anton 1980).\nSites of governance matter, as well. The high modernist vision was very much one\nof top-down government: policies were to be handed down not just from superiors\nto subordinates down the chain of command, but also from the governing centre to\nthe governed peripheries. New, and arguably more democratic, possibilities emerge\nwhen looking at governing as a bottom-up process (Tilly 1999). The city or neigh-\nborhood suddenly becomes the interesting locus of decision making, rather than thenational legislature. Attempts to increase democratic participation in local decision\nmaking have not met with uniform success, not least because of resistance from\npoliticians nearer the center of power: the resistance of mayors was a major hin-\ndrance to the \u2018\u2018community action programs\u2019\u2019 launched as part of the American Waron Poverty, for example (Marris and Rein 1982). Still, many of the most encouraging\nexamples of new deliberative processes working to democratize the existing politicalorder operate at very local levels, in local schools or police stations (Fung 2004 ).\nMeshing policy advice and policy decision with deliberation is therefore easier\nin some nations, and at some levels of government, than others. It also seems easier at\nsome historical moments than others: thus, time matters. Until about a quarter-\ncentury ago, for example, policy making in Britain was highly consensual, based\non extensive deliberation about policy options, albeit usually with a relatively\nnarrow range of privileged interests. Indeed, the very necessity of creatingaccommodation was held to be a source of weakness in the policy process (Dyson10 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\n1980; Dyson and Wilks 1983). Since then the system has shifted drastically away from\na deliberative, accommodative mode. Many of the characteristic mechanisms asso-\nciated with consultation and argument\u2014such as Royal Commissions\u2014areneglected; policy is made through tiny, often informally organized cliques in the\ncore executive.\nThe shift is partly explicable by the great sense of crisis which engulfed British\npolicy makers at the end of the 1970s, and by the conviction that crisis demanded\ndecisive action free from the encumbrances of debates with special interests. Thenotion that crisis demands decision, not debate, recurs in many di Verent times and\nplaces. Indeed \u2018\u2018making a crisis out of a drama\u2019\u2019 is a familiar rhetorical move whendecision makers want a free hand. Yet here is the paradox of crisis: critical moments\nare precisely those when the need is greatest to learn how to make better decisions;\nyet the construction of crisis as a moment when speed of decision is of the essence\nprecisely makes it the moment when those advocating persuasion and re Xexivity are\nlikely to be turned away from the policy table.\nAll is not gloom even here, however. The analysis of crises\u2014exactly, particular\ncritical events\u2014can be a powerful aid to institutional learning (March, Sproull,\nand Tamuz 1991). Moreover, there are always multiple \u2018\u2018tables\u2019\u2019\u2014multiple forums\u2014\nin which policies are argued out and bargained over. \u2018\u2018Jurisdiction shopping\u2019\u2019 is afamiliar complaint, as lawyers look for sympathetic courts to which to bring their cases\nand polluting industries look for lax regulatory regimes in which to locate. But policy\nactivists face the same suite of choices. Policies are debated, and indeed made, in many\ndiVerent forums. Each operates according to a di Verent set of rules, with a di Verent\nagenda, and on di Verent timelines; each responds to di Verent sets of pressures\nand urgencies; each has its own norms, language, and professional ethos. So whenyou cannot get satisfaction in one place, the best advice for a policy activist is\nto go knocking on some other door (Keck and Sikkink 1998; Risse, Ropp, and\nSikkink 1999).\nPlace, site, and moment often obstruct the \u2018\u2018persuasive\u2019\u2019 practice of the vocation\nof policy studies. Yet, as we show in the next section, there is overwhelming evidenceof powerful structural and institutional forces that are dragging policy makers in\na deliberative direction. These powerful forces are encompassed in accounts of\nnetworked governance.\n3. Networked Governance\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nPolicy making in the modern state commonly exhibits a contradictory character.\nUnder the press of daily demands for action, often constructed as \u2018\u2018crises,\u2019\u2019 decision\nmakers feel the need to act without delay. Yet powerful forces are pushing systems\nincreasingly in more decentralized and persuasion-based directions.the public and its policies 11\nOf course, even in notionally rigid high modernist hierarchies, the \u2018\u2018command\ntheory\u2019\u2019 of control was never wholly valid. \u2018\u2018Orders backed by threats\u2019\u2019 were never a\ngood way to get things done, in an organization any more than in governing a country.Complex organizations can never be run by coercion alone (Etzioni 1965). An e Vective\nauthority structure, just like an e Vective legal system, presupposes that the people\noperating within it themselves internalize the rules it lays down and critically evaluate\ntheir own conduct according to its precepts (Hart 1961). That is true even of the most\nnominally bureaucratic environments: for instance, Heclo and Wildavsky ( 1974)\ncharacterize the relations among politicians and public o Ycials in the taxing\nand spending departments of British government as a \u2018\u2018village community\u2019\u2019 full ofinformal norms and negotiated meanings: an anthropologically \u2018\u2018private\u2019\u2019 way of\ngoverning public money.\nThus there have always been limits to command. But the argument that, increas-\ningly, government is giving way to \u2018\u2018governance\u2019\u2019 suggests something more interesting,and something peculiarly relevant to our \u2018\u2018persuasive\u2019\u2019 conception of policy studies:\nthat governing is less and less a matter of ruling through hierarchical authority\nstructures, and more and more a matter of negotiating through a decentralized series\nofXoating alliances. The dominant image is that of \u2018\u2018networked governance\u2019\u2019 (Heclo\n1978; Rhodes 1997; Castels 2000 ). Some actors are more central, others more periph-\neral, in those networks. But even those actors at the central nodes of networks are not\nin a position to dictate to the others. Broad cooperation from a great many e Vectively\nindependent actors is required in order for any of them to accomplish their goals.\nTo some extent, that has always been the deeper reality underlying constitutional\nWctions suggesting otherwise. Formally, the Queen in Parliament may be all powerful\nand may in Dicey\u2019s phrase, \u2018\u2018make or unmake any law whatsoever\u2019\u2019 (Dicey 1960/1885,\n39\u201340). Nonetheless, Wrm albeit informal constitutional conventions mean there are\nmyriad things that she simply may not do and retain any serious expectation ofretaining her royal prerogatives (unlike, apparently, her representative in other parts\nof her realm) (Marshall 1984). Formally, Britain was long a unitary state and local\ngovernments were utterly creatures of the central state; but even in the days ofparliamentary triumphalism the political realities were such that the center had to\nbargain with local governments rather than simply dictate to them, even on purely\nWnancial matters (Rhodes 1988).\nBut increasingly such realities are looming larger and the Wctions even smaller.\nPolicy increasingly depends on what economists call \u2018\u2018relational contracts:\u2019\u2019 anagreement to agree, a settled intention to \u2018\u2018work together on this,\u2019\u2019 with details left\nto be speci Wed sometime later (Gibson and Goodin 1999). Some fear a \u2018\u2018joint decision\ntrap,\u2019\u2019 in circumstances where there are too many veto players (Scharpf 1988). But\nGunnar Myrdal\u2019s ( 1955,8,20) description of the workings of the early days of the\nEconomic Commission for Europe is increasingly true not just of intergovernmentalnegotiations but intragovernmental ones as well:\nIf an organization acquires a certain stability and settles down to a tradition of work,\none implication is usually that on the whole the same state o Ycials come together at12 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nregular intervals. If in addition it becomes repeatedly utilized for reaching inter governmental\nagreements in a given Weld, it may acquire a certain institutional weight and a momentum.\nCertain substitutes for real political sanctions can then gradually be built up. They areall informal and frail. They assume a commonly shared appreciation of the general usefulnessof earlier results reached, the similarly shared pride of, and solidarity towards, the \u2018\u2018club\u2019\u2019 ofparticipants at the meetings, and a considerable in Xuence of the civil servants on the home\ngovernments in the particular kind of questions dealt with in the organizations. . . . Notupholding an agreement is something like a breach of etiquette in a club.\nAnd so it has gone in the later life of the European Community, and now the\nEuropean Union (He \u00b4ritier 1999).7\nWithin these networks, none is in command. Bringing others along, preserving the\nrelationship, is all. Persuasion is the way policy gets made, certainly in any literal\u2018\u2018institutional void\u2019\u2019 (Hajer 2003) but even within real institutions, where authority is\ntypically more Wctive than real (Heclo and Wildavsky 1974).\nIf this is bad news for titular heads of notionally policy-making organizations, it is\ngood news for the otherwise disenfranchised. The history of recent successes inprotecting human rights internationally is a case in point. Advocacy coalitions are\nassembled, linking groups of powerless Nigerians whose rights are being abused by\nthe Nigerian government with groups of human rights activists abroad, who bring\npressure to bear on their home governments to bring pressure to bear in turn onNigeria (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Keck and Sikkink 1998). Networking across\nstate borders, as well as across communities and a Vected interests within state\nborders, can be an important \u2018\u2018weapon of the weak\u2019\u2019 (Scott 1985).\nThe change has invaded areas hitherto thought of as the heartland of hierarchy and\nof authoritative decision by the rich and powerful.\nBureaucratic organizations, paradigms of Weberian hierarchy, are yielding to \u2018\u2018soft\nbureaucracy\u2019\u2019 (Courpasson 2000 ). And in the world of globally organized business,\nBraithwaite and Drahos ( 2000 ) paint a picture of a decentered world, where networks\nof bewildering complexity produce regulation often without the formality of any\nprecise moment of decision.\nThe rise of networked governance in turn accounts for a related turn that is central to\nthe practice of the \u2018\u2018persuasive\u2019\u2019 vocation: the self-conscious turn to government assteering.\n7For example, \u2018\u2018it is rare in [European] Community environmental policy for negotiations to fail. . . .\nAn important factor seems to be the dynamics of long lasting negotiations: i.e., the \u2018entanglement\u2019 of the\nnegotiations which ultimately exerts such pressure on the representatives of dissenters (especially where\nthere is only one dissenting state) that a compromise can be reached . . . [O]n the whole, no member state\nis willing to assume the responsibility for causing the failure of negotiations that have lasted for years andin which mutual trust in the willingness of all negotiators to contribute to an agreement has been builtup\u2019\u2019 (Rehbinder and Stewart 1985,265).the public and its policies 13\n4. Rowing versus Steering\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nHigh modernist models of policy making were, Wrst and foremost, models of central\ncontrol. On those models, policy makers were supposed to decide what should be\ndone to promote the public good, and then to make it happen.\nThis ambition became increasingly implausible as problems to which policy was\naddressed became (or came to be recognized as) increasingly complex. Despite brave\ntalk of ways of \u2018\u2018organizing social complexity\u2019\u2019 (Deutsch 1963; La Porte 1975), a sense\nsoon set in that government was \u2018\u2018overloaded\u2019\u2019 and society was politically ungovern-able (King 1975; Crozier, Huntington, and Watanuki 1975). Despite the aspiration of\nconstantly improving social conditions, producing generally good outcomes for\npeople without fail, a sense emerged that society is now characterized by increasingly\npervasive risks, both individually and collectively (Beck 1992).\nEven when policy makers thought they had a Wrm grip on the levers of power at the\ncenter, however, they long feared that they had much less of a grip on those\nresponsible for implementing their policies on the ground. \u2018\u2018Street-level bureau-\ncrats\u2019\u2019\u2014police, caseworkers in social service agencies, and such like\u2014inevitably\napply o Ycial policies in ways and places at some distance from close scrutiny by\nsuperiors (Lipsky 1980). Substantial de facto discretion inevitably follows, however\ntightly rule bound their actions are formally supposed to be. But it is not just\nbureaucrats literally on the streets who enjoy such discretion. Organization theoristshave developed the general concept of \u2018\u2018control loss\u2019\u2019 to describe the way in which the\ntop boss\u2019s power to control subordinates slips away the further down the chain of\ncommand the subordinate is (Blau 1963; Deutsch 1963). It can never be taken for\ngranted that policies will be implemented on the ground as intended: usually theywill not (Pressman and Wildavsky 1973; Bardach 1977,1980).\nOne early response to appreciation of problems of control loss within a system of\npublic management was to abandon \u2018\u2018command-and-control\u2019\u2019 mechanisms for evok-\ning compliance with public policies, in favor of a system of \u2018\u2018incentives\u2019\u2019 (Kneese and\nSchultze 1975; Schultze 1977). The thought was that, if you structure the incentives\ncorrectly, people will thereby have a reason for doing what you want them to do,\nwithout further intrusive intervention from public o Ycials in the day-to-day man-\nagement of their a Vairs. This thinking persisted into the 1980s and 1990s: it lay, for\ninstance, behind the mania for \u2018\u2018internal markets\u2019\u2019 in so many of the state-funded\nhealth care systems of Europe (Le Grand 1991; Saltman and von Otter 1992). The\ntrick, of course, lies in setting the incentives just right. Allowing the NuclearRegulatory Commission to Wne unsafe nuclear power plants only $ 5,000a day for\nunsafe practices, when it would cost the power company $ 300,000a day to purchase\nsubstitute power o Vthe grid, is hardly a deterrent (US Comptroller General 1979).\nAppreciation of the incapacity of the center to exercise e Vective control over what\nhappens on the ground through command and control within a hierarchy has alsoled to increasing \u2018\u2018contracting out\u2019\u2019 of public services, public\u2013private partnerships,14 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nand arm\u2019s-length government (Smith and Lipsky 1993; Commission on Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships 2001). The image typically evoked here is one of \u2018\u2018steering, not\nrowing\u2019\u2019 (Kaufmann, Majone, and Ostrom 1985; Bovens 1990).\nTwin thoughts motivate this development. The Wrst is that, by divesting themselves\nof responsibility for front-line service delivery, the policy units of government will be\nin a better position to focus on strategic policy choice (Osborne and Gaebler 1993;\nGore 1993). The second thought is that by stipulating \u2018\u2018performance standards\u2019\u2019 in the\nterms of contract, and monitoring compliance with them, public servants will be\nbetter able to ensure that public services are properly delivered than they would have\nbeen had those services been provided within the public sector itself.\nThis is hardly the Wrst time such a thing has happened. In the early history of the\nmodern state, under arrangements that have come to be called \u2018\u2018tax farming,\u2019\u2019 rulers\nused to subcontract tax collections to local nobles, with historically very mixed\nsuccess. Fix the incentives as the prince tried, the nobles always seemed to be abletoWgure out some way of diddling the crown (Levi 1988). Those committed to\nsteering, by monitoring others\u2019 rowing, would like to think they have learned howbetter to specify and monitor contract compliance. But so too has every prince\u2019s new\nadviser.\nThe history of \u2018\u2018steering and rowing\u2019\u2019 crystallizes the contradictory character of the\nmodern \u2018\u2018governance\u2019\u2019 state, and illuminates also the complex relations between\n\u2018\u2018governance\u2019\u2019 and the conception of policy studies as a persuasive vocation. On the\none hand, powerful, well-documented forces are pushing policy systems in the\ndirection of deliberation, consultation, and accommodation. \u2018\u2018High modernism\u2019\u2019 isaccompanied by high complexity, which requires high doses of voluntary coordin-\nation. And high modernism has also helped create smart people who cannot simply\nbe ordered around: rising levels of formal education, notably sharp rises in partici-\npation in higher education, have created large social groups with the inclination, and\nthe intellectual resources, to demand a say in policy making. These are some of the\nsocial developments that lie behind the spread of loosely networked advocacy\ncoalitions of the kind noted above.\nModern steering may therefore be conceived as demanding a more democratic\nmode of statecraft\u2014one where the practice of the persuasive vocation of policy\nstudies is peculiarly important. But as we have also just seen, \u2018\u2018steering\u2019\u2019 can have a\nless democratic face. It echoes the ambitions of princes, and a world of centralizedscrutiny and monitoring pre Wgured in Bentham\u2019s ( 1787) Panopticon. The earliest\nimages of the steering state, in Plato\u2019s Republic , are indeed avowedly authoritarian;\nand the greatest \u2018\u2018helmsman\u2019\u2019 of the modern era was also one of its most brutal\nautocrats, Mao Zedong.\nAs the language of \u2018\u2018steering\u2019\u2019 therefore shows, the legacy of \u2018\u2018networked govern-\nance\u2019\u2019 is mixed, indeed contradictory, inscribed with both autocracy and democracy.\nThis helps explain much of the Wxation of the new public management on monitor-\ning and control.\nFor all the borrowing that new public management, with its privatization and\noutsourcing, has done from economics, the one bit of economics it seems steadfastlythe public and its policies 15\nto ignore is the one bit that ought presumably to have most relevance to the state as\nan organized enterprise: the economic theory of the Wrm (Simon 2000 ).\nTwo key works emphasize the point. One is Ronald Coase\u2019s ( 1937) early analysis of\nwhy to internalize production within the same Wrm, rather than just buying the\ncomponents required from other producers on the open market\u2014the \u2018\u2018produce/buy\ndecision.\u2019\u2019 The answer is obvious as soon as the question is asked. You want to\ninternalize production within the Wrm if, but only if, you have more con Wdence in\nyour capacity to monitor and control the quality of the inputs into the productionprocess than the quality of the outputs (the components you would alternatively have\nto buy on the open market). You produce in-house only when you are relatively\nuncon Wdent of your capacity to monitor the quality of the goods that external\nproducers supply to you.\nOne implication of this analysis for contracting out of public services to private\norganizations is plain: for the same reason that a private organization is formed to\nprovide the service, the public should be hesitant to contract to them. For the samereason the private organization does not buy in the outputs it promises to supply,\npreferring to produce them in-house, so too should the public organization: con-\ntracts are inevitably incomplete, performance standards underspeci Wed, and\nthe room for maximizing private pro Wts at the cost of the public purposes is too\ngreat. Indeed this problem of what may summarily be called \u2018\u2018opportunism\u2019\u2019 lies at\nthe heart of the way the new institutional economics addresses the Wrm (Williamson\n1985,29\u201332,281\u20135). There then follows another obvious implication: if we do contract\nout public services, it is better to contract them out to non-pro Wt suppliers who are\nknown to share the goals that the public had in establishing the program than it is to\ncontract them out to for-pro Wt suppliers whose interests clearly diverge from the\npublic purposes (Smith and Lipsky 1993; Rose-Ackerman 1996; Goodin 2003).\nThe second contribution to the theory of the Wrm that ought to bear on current\npractices of outsourcing and privatizing public services is Herbert Simon\u2019s ( 1951)\nanalysis of the \u2018\u2018employment relationship.\u2019\u2019 The key to that, too, is the notion of\n\u2018\u2018incomplete contracting.\u2019\u2019 The reason we hire someone as an employee of our Wrm\nis that we cannot specify, in detail in advance, exactly what performances will berequired. If we could, we would subcontract the services: but not knowing exactly\nwhat we want, we cannot write the relevant performance contract. Instead we write an\nemployment contract, of the general form that says: \u2018\u2018The employee will do whateverthe employer says.\u2019\u2019 Rudely, it is a slavery contract (suitably circumscribed by labour\nlaw); politely, it is a \u2018\u2018relational contract,\u2019\u2019 an agreement to stand in a relationship the\nprecise terms of which will be speci Wed later (Williamson 1985). Indeed as North\npoints out, there are even elements of the relational in the master\u2013slave relationship(1990,32). But the basic point, once again, is that we cannot specify in advance what is\nwanted: and insofar as we cannot, that makes a powerful case for producing in-houserather than contracting out. And that is as true for public organizations as private, and\nonce again equally for public organizations contracting with private organizations .F o r\nthe same reasons that the private contractors employ people at all, for those very same\nreasons the state ought not to subcontract to those private suppliers.16 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nThe more general way in which these insights have been picked up among policy\nmakers is in the slogan, \u2018\u2018privatization entails regulation.\u2019\u2019 A naive reading of the\n\u2018\u2018downsizing government\u2019\u2019 program of Reagan and Thatcher and their copyists world-wide might lead one to suppose that it would have resulted in \u2018\u2018less government:\u2019\u2019\nspeci Wcally, among other things, \u2018\u2018less regulation\u2019\u2019 (after all, \u2018\u2018deregulation\u2019\u2019 was one of\nitsWrst aims). But in truth privatization, outsourcing, and the like actually requires\nmore regulation, not less (Majone 1994; Moran 2003). At a minimum, it requires\ndetailed speci Wcation of the terms of the contract and careful monitoring of contract\ncompliance. Thus, we should not be surprised that the sheer number of regulations\nemanating from privatized polities is an order of magnitude larger (Levi-Faur 2003;\nMoran 2003).\nThe paradoxes of privatization and regulation thus just bring us back to the\nbeginning of the growth of government in the nineteenth century. That came as apragmatic response to practical circumstances, if anything against the ideologicalcurrent of the day. No political forces were pressing for an expansion of government,\nparticularly. It was just a matter of one disaster after another making obvious the\nneed, across a range of sectors, for tighter public regulation and an inspectorate to\nenforce it (MacDonagh 1958,1961; Atiyah 1979). Over the course of the next century,\nsome of those sectors were taken into public hands, only then to be reprivatized. Itshould come as no surprise, however, that the same sort of regulatory control should\nbe needed over those activities, once reprivatized, as proved necessary before they\nhad been nationalized. There was a \u2018\u2018pattern\u2019\u2019 to government growth identi Wed by\nMacDonagh ( 1958,1961); and there is likely a pattern of regulatory growth under\nprivatization.\n5. Policy, Practice, and Persuasion\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nTo do something \u2018\u2018as a matter of policy\u2019\u2019 is to do it as a general rule. That is the\ndistinction between \u2018\u2018policy\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018administration\u2019\u2019 (Wilson 1887), between \u2018\u2018legislat-\ning\u2019\u2019 policy and \u2018\u2018executing\u2019\u2019 it (Locke 1690, ch. 12). Policy makers of the most\nambitious sort aspire to \u2018\u2018make policy\u2019\u2019 in that general rule-setting way, envisioning\nadministrators applying those general rules to particular cases in a minimally discre-\ntionary fashion (Calvert, McCubbins, and Weingast 1989). That and cognate aspir-\nations toward taut control from the center combine to constitute a central trope of\npolitical high modernism\nOne aspect of that is the aspiration, or rather illusion, of total central control. All\nthe great management tools of the last century were marshaled in support of that\nproject: linear programming, operations research, cost\u2013bene Wt analysis, management\nby objectives, case-controlled random experiments, and so on (Rivlin 1971; Self 1975;\nStokey and Zeckhauser 1978).the public and its policies 17\nOne non-negligible problem with models of central control is that there is\nnever any single, stable central authority that can be in complete control. For\nwould-be totalitarians that is a sad fact; for democratic pluralists it is something tocelebrate. But whatever one\u2019s attitude toward the fact, it remains a hard fact of\npolitical life that the notional \u2018\u2018center\u2019\u2019 is always actually occupied by many compet-\ning authorities. A Congressional Budget O Yce will always spring up to challenge the\nmonolithic power of an Executive Branch General Accounting O Yce, just as double\nsets of books will always be kept in all the line departments of the most tightly\nplanned economy.\nIn any case, total central control is always a fraud or a Wction. In the terms of\nthe old Soviet joke, \u2018\u2018They pretend to set quotas, and we pretend to meet them.\u2019\u2019\nThe illusion of planning was preserved, even when producers wildly exceeded their\ntargets: which surely must, in truth, have indicated a failure of planning, just as\nmuch as missing their targets in the other direction would have been (Wildavsky1973). Every bureaucrat, whether on the street or in some branch o Yce, knows\nwell the important gap between \u2018\u2018what they think we\u2019re doing, back in centraloYce\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018what actually happens around here.\u2019\u2019 And any new recruit incapable of\nmastering that distinction will not be long for that bureau\u2019s world\u2014just as anylandless peasant who supposes that some entitlement will be enforced merely because\nit is written down somewhere in a statute book will soon be sadly disappointed\n(Galanter 1974).\nOne solution is of course to abandon central planning altogether and marketize\neverything (Self 1993). The \u2018\u2018shock treatment\u2019\u2019 to which the formerly planned econ-\nomies of central Europe were subjected at the end of the cold war often seemed to\namount to something like that (Sacks 1995; World Bank 1996). But as we have seen\nabove, even the more moderate ambitions of privatization and creating managedmarkets in the established capitalist democracies, led to anything but a more\ndecentralized world: they created their own powerful incentives to monitor and\ncontrol.\nMore modestly, there are new modes of more decentralized planning and control\nthat are more sensitive to those realities. \u2018\u2018Indicative planning\u2019\u2019 loosens up the\nplanning process: instead of setting taut and unchanging targets, it merely points\nin certain desired directions and recalibrates future targets in light of what past\npractice has shown to be realistic aspirations (Meade 1970).\nMore generally, policy makers can rely more heavily on \u2018\u2018loose\u2019\u2019 laws and regula-\ntions. Instead of tightly specifying exact performance requirements (in ways that arebound to leave some things unspeci Wed), the laws and regulations can be written in\nmore general and vaguely aspirational terms (Goodin 1982,59\u201372). Hard-headed\npolitical realists might think the latter pure folly, trusting too much to people\u2019s\ngoodwill (or, alternatively, putting too much power in the hands of administrators\ncharged with interpreting and applying loose laws and regulations). But it has been\nshown that, for example, nursing homes achieve higher levels of performance in\ncountries regulating them in that \u2018\u2018looser\u2019\u2019 way than in countries that try to write theregulations in a more detailed way (Braithwaite et al. 1993).18 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nAn interesting variation on these themes is the Open Method of Coordination\npracticed within the European Union. That consists essentially in \u2018\u2018benchmarking.\u2019\u2019\nIn the Wrst instance, there is merely a process of collecting information on policy\nperformance from all member states on some systematic, comparable basis. But once\nthat has been done, the performance of better-performing states will almost auto-\nmatically come to serve as a \u2018\u2018benchmark\u2019\u2019 for the others to aspire to\u2014voluntarily\ninitially, but with increasing amounts of informal and formal pressure as time goes by\n(Atkinson et al. 2002 ;OVe2003).\nAnother aspect of \u2018\u2018political high modernism\u2019\u2019 is the illusion of instrumental\nrationality completely governing the policy process. That is the illusion that policy\nmakers begin with a full set of ends (values, goals) that are to be pursued, full\ninformation about the means available for pursuing them, and full information\nabout the constraints (material, social, and political resources) available for pursuing\nthem.\n\u2018\u2018Full information\u2019\u2019 is always an illusion. Policy, like all human action, is under-\ntaken partly in ignorance; and to a large extent is a matter of \u2018\u2018learning-by-doing\u2019\u2019(Arrow 1962; Betts 1978). In practice, we never really have all the information we need\nto \u2018\u2018optimize.\u2019\u2019 At best, we \u2018\u2018satis Wce\u2019\u2019\u2014set some standard of what is \u2018\u2018good enough,\u2019\u2019\nand content ourselves with reaching that (Simon 1955). In the absence of full\ninformation about the \u2018\u2018best possible,\u2019\u2019 we never really know for certain whetherour standard of \u2018\u2018good enough\u2019\u2019 is too ambitious or not ambitious enough. If we set\neducational standards too high, too many children will be \u2018\u2018left behind\u2019\u2019 as failures; if\ntoo low, passing does them little pedagogic good.\nThe failure of instrumental reason in the \u2018\u2018full information\u2019\u2019 domain is unsurpris-\ning. Its failure in the other two domains is perhaps more so. Policy makers can neverbe sure exactly what resources are, or will be, available for pursuing any set of aims. It\nis not only Soviet-style planners who faced \u2018\u2018soft budget constraints\u2019\u2019 (Kornai, Maskin,\nand Roland 2003). So do policy makers worldwide. In the literal sense of Wnancial\nbudgets, they often do not know how much they have to spend or how much they areactually committing themselves to spending. Legislating an \u2018\u2018entitlement\u2019\u2019 program is\nto write a blank check, giving rise to spending that is \u2018\u2018uncontrollable\u2019\u2019 (Derthick\n1975)\u2014uncontrollable, anyway, without a subsequent change in the legislation, for\nwhich political resources might be lacking, given the political interests coalescedaround entitlements thus created (Pierson 1994). In a more di Vuse sense of social\nsupport, policy makers again often do not know how much they have or need for any\ngiven policy. Sometimes they manage to garner more support for programs once\nunder way than could ever have been imagined, initially; and conversely, programs\nthat began with vast public support sometimes lose it precipitously and unpredictably.\nIn short: perfect means\u2013ends Wtters, in \u2018\u2018high modernist\u2019\u2019 mode, would maximize goal\nsatisfaction within the constraints of the resources available to them; but public policymakers, in practice, often do not have much of a clue what resources really will\nultimately be available.\nPolicy makers also often do not have a clear sense of the full range of instruments\navailable to them. Policies are intentions, the product of creative human imagination.the public and its policies 19\nPolicy making can proceed in a more or less inventive way: by deliberately engaging\nin brainstorming and free association, rather than just rummaging around to see\nwhat \u2018\u2018solutions looking for problems\u2019\u2019 are lying at the bottom of the existing\u2018\u2018garbage can\u2019\u2019 of the policy universe (Olsen 1972a; March 1976; March and Olsen\n1976). But creative though they may be, policy makers will always inevitably fail the\nhigh modernist ambition to some greater or lesser degree because of their inevitably\nlimited knowledge of all the possible means by which goals might be pursued in\npolicy.\nPerhaps most surprising of all, policy makers fail the \u2018\u2018high modernist\u2019\u2019 ambition\nof perfect instrumental rationality in not even having any clear, settled idea what all\nthe ends (values, goals) of policy are. Much is inevitably part of the taken-for-granted\nbackground in all intentional action. It might never occur to us to specify that we\nvalue some outcome that we always enjoyed until some new policy intervention\nsuddenly threatens it: wilderness and species diversity, or the climate, or stablefamilies, or whatever. We often do not know what we want until we see what we\nget, not because our preferences are irrationally adaptive (or perhaps counter-\nadaptive) but merely because our capacities to imagine and catalog all good things\nare themselves strictly limited (March 1976).\nThe limits to instrumental rationality strengthen the case made in this chapter\nfor policy studies as a persuasive vocation, for they strengthen the case that policy is\nbest made, and developed, as a kind of journey of self-discovery, in which we have\nexperientially to learn what we actually want. And what we learn to want is in part\na product of what we already have and know\u2014which is to say, is in part a productof what policy has been hitherto. Recognizing the limits to instrumental rationality\nalso strengthens the case for a self-conscious eclecticism in choice of the \u2018\u2018tools of\ngovernment\u2019\u2019 (Hood 1983; Salamon 2002 ). These \u2018\u2018tools\u2019\u2019 are social technologies,\nand thus their use and e Vectiveness are highly contingent on the setting in which\nthey are employed. That setting is also in part a product of what has gone before.\nIn other words, policy legacies are a key factor in policy choice\u2014and to these we\nnow turn.\n6. Policy as its Own Cause\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nIt may truly be the case that \u2018\u2018policy is its own cause.\u2019\u2019 That is the case not just\nin the unfortunate sense in which cynics like Wildavsky ( 1979, ch. 3) originally\nintended the term: that every attempt to Wx one problem creates several more; that\nevery \u2018\u2018purposive social action\u2019\u2019 always carries with it certain \u2018\u2018unintended conse-\nquences\u2019\u2019 (Merton 1936). Nor is it simply a matter of issues cycling in and out of\nfashion, with the costs of solving some problem becoming more visible than thebeneWts (Downs 1972; Hirschman 1982). It can also be true in more positive senses.20 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nAs we experiment with some policy interventions, we get new ideas of better\nways to pursue old goals and a clearer view of what new goals we collectively also\nvalue.\nFrom an organizational point of view, solving problems can be as problematic as\nnot solving them. The March of Dimes had to rede Wne its mission or close up shop,\nafter its original goal\u2014conquering polio\u2014had been achieved. What Lasswell ( 1941)\ncalled the US \u2018\u2018Garrison State\u2019\u2019 had to Wnd some new raison d\u2019e \u02c6treonce the cold war\nhad been won. Policy is its own cause in cases of successes as well as failures: in both\ncases, some new policy has to be found, and found fast, if the organization is to\nendure.\nPolicy successes can cause problems in a substantive rather than merely organiza-\ntional sense. Longevity, increasing disability-free life years, is a central goal\nof health policy and one of the great accomplishments of the modern era. But\ngood though it is in other respects, increasing longevity compromises the assump-tions upon which \u2018\u2018pay-as-you-go\u2019\u2019 pension systems were predicated, giving rise to\nthe \u2018\u2018old-age crisis\u2019\u2019 that has so exercised pension reformers worldwide (World\nBank 1994).\nPolicy can be its own cause both directly and indirectly. A policy might successfully\nchange the social world in precisely the ways intended, and then those changes\nmight themselves either prevent or enable certain further policy developments\nalong similar lines. This is the familiar story of \u2018\u2018path dependency:\u2019\u2019 the subsequent\nmoves available to you being a function of previous moves you have taken. Some-\ntimes path dependency works to the advantage of policy makers: once villagepost o Yces are set up to deliver the Royal Mail across the realm, the same infra-\nstructure is suddenly available also to pay all sorts of social bene Wts (pensions, family\nallowances, and such like) over the counter through them; there, the latter policy\nis easier to implement because of the Wrst (Pierson 2000 ). Sometimes path depend-\nency works the other way, making subsequent policy developments harder.An example of that is the way in which pensions being paid to Civil War veterans\nundercut the potential political constituency for universal old-age pensions in\nthe USA for fully a generation or two after the rest of the developed world\nhad adopted them (Skocpol 1992). Policy is its own cause due to such path depend-\nencies, as well.\n7. Constraints\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nPolicy making is always a matter of choice under constraint. But not all the con-straints are material. Some are social and political, having to do with the willingness\nof people to do what your policy asks of them or with the willingness of electors to\nendorse the policies that would-be policy makers espouse.the public and its policies 21\nAnother large source of constraints on policy making, however, is ideational.\nTechnology is at its most fundamental a set of ideas for how to use a set of resources\nto achieve certain desired outcomes. The same is true of the \u2018\u2018technology of policy\u2019\u2019 asit is of the more familiar sorts of \u2018\u2018technology of production.\u2019\u2019 Ideas of how to pursue\nimportant social goals are forever in short supply (Reich 1988).\nOccasionally new policy ideas originate with creative policy analysts. Take two\nexamples from the realm of criminology. One idea about why the long, anonymous\ncorridors of public housing complexes were such dangerous places was that common\nspace was everybody\u2019s and nobody\u2019s: it was nobody\u2019s business to monitor, protect,\nand defend that space. If public housing were designed instead in such a way as to\ncreate enclaves of \u2018\u2018defensible space,\u2019\u2019 crime might be reduced (Newman 1972).\nAnother idea is that \u2018\u2018broken windows\u2019\u2019 might signal that \u2018\u2018nobody cares\u2019\u2019 aboutthis neighborhood, thus relaxing inhibitions on further vandalism and crime. Crack-\ning down on petty misdemeanors might reduce crime by sending the opposite signal(Wilson and Kelling 1982).\nMore often, however, policy making is informed by \u2018\u2018o Vthe shelf\u2019\u2019 ideas. Sometimes\nthese are borrowed from other jurisdictions. In times gone by\u2014the times of mimeo-\ngraphed legislative proposals being dropped into the legislative hopper\u2014policy\nborrowing could be traced by tracking the typographical errors in legislative proposals\nin one jurisdiction being replicated in the next (Walker 1969). In other cases, the\nborrowing is from casebooks and classrooms of Public Policy Schools, or underpressure from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (Stiglitz 2002 ).\nMarch and Olsen ( 1976; Olsen 1972a) famously capture this proposition with their\n\u2018\u2018garbage can model\u2019\u2019 of public policy making. Policy choice is there characterized asthe con Xuence of three streams: problems looking for solutions; solutions looking for\nproblems; and people looking for things to do. The Wrst stream, but only that one,\nlines up with the hyper-rationalism of political high modernism. The latter stream\nrepresents the desperation of post-polio March of Dimers and the post-cold war\nGarrison State, looking for things to do once their original missions had been\naccomplished. The middle stream\u2014solutions looking for problems\u2014captures the\npaucity of policy ideas that serves as a major constraint on high modernist policy\nmaking.\nHigh modernist policy making is supposed to be a matter of instrumentally\nrationally Wtting means to ends. But often the means come Wrst, and they get applied\n(inevitably imperfectly) to whatever end comes along which they might remotely Wt.\nTake the case of the cruise missile. That technology originally developed as anunarmed decoy to be launched by bombers to confuse enemy radar as they pene-\ntrated enemy airspace; but when the Senate insisted that surely some of those missiles\nshould be armed, the air force dropped the scheme rather than acquiesce in the\ndevelopment of unmanned weapons systems. There was a subsequent attempt to\nadapt the technology jointly by the air force for use on \u2018\u2018stand-o Vbombers\u2019\u2019 ( Wring\nthe missiles while still in friendly airspace) and by the navy for use on submarines;but given the di Verences between launching through an airplane\u2019s \u2018\u2018short range attack\nmissile\u2019\u2019 launcher and a submarine\u2019s torpedo tube, that joint venture came to naught.22 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nSo the original plan was shelved. But the idea was kept on the shelf; and several years\nlater, in a window of strategic opportunity opened up by the SALT I agreements, the\ncruise missile was suddenly resurrected, this time as a ground-based missile systeminstalled on the edge of the Evil Empire (Levine 1977).\nEqually often, certain sorts of means constitute a \u2018\u2018good Wt\u2019\u2019 to certain sorts of\nends, only under certain conditions which themselves are subject to change. Those\noften unspoken \u2018\u2018background conditions\u2019\u2019 constitute further constraints to policy\nmaking. Consider, for example, the peculiarly Australian style of \u2018\u2018worker\u2019s welfare\nstate,\u2019\u2019 which made good sense under the conditions of its introduction at the\nbeginning of the twentieth century but no sense under the conditions prevailing by\nthat century\u2019s end: if you have, as Australia initially had, full employment and an\nindustrial arbitration system that ensured that everyone in employment earned\nenough to support a family, then you need no elaborate scheme of transfer payments\nto compensate people for inadequacies in their market income; but once you have(as under Thatcherite Labor and even more right-wing coalition governments)\neviscerated both full employment and industrial arbitration schemes, and with\nthem any guarantee of a \u2018\u2018living wage\u2019\u2019 from market sources, the traditional absence\nof any transfer scheme to compensate for inadequacies in market income bites hard\n(Castles 1985,2001).\nThe largest constraint under which public policy operates, of course, is the sheer\nselWshness of entrenched interests possessed of su Ycient power to promote those\ninterests in the most indefensible of ways. Politics, Shapiro ( 1999) usefully reminds\nus, is ultimately all about \u2018\u2018interests and power.\u2019\u2019 Anyone who has watched the farmlobby at work, anywhere in the world, would not doubt that for a moment (Self and\nStoring 1962; Smith 1990; Grant 1997). Neither would anyone conversant with the\nearly history of the British National Health Service and the deeply cynical maneu-vering of physicians to avoid becoming employees of the state (Marmor and Thomas\n1972; Klein 2001).\nMoralists hope for more, as do conscientious policy analysts. But at the end of the\nday, politics may well end up being purely about \u2018\u2018who gets what, when, how\u2019\u2019 as the\nWrst self-styled policy scientist long ago taught us (Lasswell 1950).\nEven those most political of constraints might be of indeterminate strength,\nthough. Consider for example the growth of \u2018\u2018alternative medicine\u2019\u2019 in the USA.\nProfessional medicine, especially in the USA, is a powerfully organized interest(Marmor 1994). Ordinarily we expect its practitioners to be able to see o Vany\nchallengers with ease. Certainly they successfully froze chiropractors out, whenthey tried to horn in on the business of osteopaths, for example. Somehow, however,\n\u2018\u2018alternative medicine\u2019\u2019 has managed to become su Yciently established\u2014despite the\npolitical power of conventional medical practitioners\u2014to appear now as an optionin Americans\u2019 Health Maintenance Organizations and to be eligible for reimburse-\nment by health insurance schemes. It may just be a case of the political power of the\ninsurance industry, weary of ever-escalating medical costs, having been mobilized\nagainst the political power of physicians, with practitioners of alternative medicinebeing the incidental bene Wciaries. But, ex ante , that would have been a surprising andthe public and its policies 23\nunexpected source of political support for the alternative medicine movement: ex\nante, one could scarcely have guessed that the power of organized medicine was as\nfragile as it turned out to be in this respect.\nOf course, \u2018\u2018constraints\u2019\u2019 are not immutable. Indeed, one person\u2019s constraint may\nbe another person\u2019s opportunity. From Kingdon\u2019s windows of opportunity ( 1984)t o\nHall\u2019s political power of economic ideas ( 1989) we see how the story is more than one\nabout constraints: it is also about opportunities for change. These we now examine.\n8. Change, Constraint, and\nDemocratic Politics\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nThe story of policy is in part a story about constraints. But it is also a story about\nchange, and that is what we now examine. Policies change for all sorts of reasons. The\nproblems change; the environments change; technologies improve; alliances alter;\nkey sta Vcome and go; powerful interests weigh in. For those sadly in the know, all\nthose are familiar facts of the policy world.\nBut for those still inspired by democratic ideals, there is at least sometimes\nanother side to the story: policies can sometimes change because the people subjectto those policies want them to change. There is a mass mobilization of groups\npressing for reform\u2014workers pressing for legislation on hours and wages, racial\nor religious minorities pressing for civil rights, women pressing for gender equity.\nWhat is more, there is powerful comparative evidence that social and cultural\ndevelopments are promoting the spread of these mass groups (Cain, Dalton, andScarrow 2003).\nAdvocacy groups are always an important force, even in routine policy making\n(Sabatier and Jenkins-Smith 1993). And they are becoming more so, in networked\ntransnational society (Keck and Sikkink 1998; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999). But\nthey are often treated as \u2018\u2018just another interested party\u2019\u2019\u2014like physicians vis-a `-vis the\nNHS\u2014speaking for narrow sectoral interests alone, however much they mightpretend otherwise. Even (or perhaps especially) self-styled \u2018\u2018public interest lobbies\u2019\u2019\nlike Common Cause are often said to lack any authority to speak with any authority\nabout what is \u2018\u2018in the public interest:\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018self-styled\u2019\u2019 is importantly di Verent from\n\u2018\u2018duly elected,\u2019\u2019 as members of Congress regularly remind Common Cause lobbyists\n(McFarland 1976; Berry 1977).\nSocial movements are advocacy coalitions writ large. They bring pressure to bear\nwhere politically it matters, in terms of democratic theory: on elected o Ycials.\nSometimes the pressure succeeds, and Voting Rights Acts are legislated. Othertimes it fails, and the Equal Rights Amendment gets past Congress but is stymied\nby political countermobilization in statehouses (Mansbridge 1986). Sometimes there\nis no very precise set of legislative demands in view, as with the \u2018\u2018poor people\u2019s24 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nmovement\u2019\u2019 of the early 1970s (Piven and Cloward 1979), and the aim is mostly just to\nalter the tone of the national debate.\nThere is always an element of that, in any social movement. Even social move-\nments ostensibly organized around speci Wc legal texts\u2014the proposed Great Charter\nor Equal Rights Amendment\u2014were always about much more than merely enacting\nthose texts into law. Still, for social movements to have any impact on policy, they\nhave to have some relatively speci Wc policy implications. Every social movement, if it\nis to make any material di Verence, has to have a determinate answer to the question,\n\u2018\u2018What do we want, and when do we want it?\u2019\u2019\nA full discussion of social movements would take us deep into the territory\ncovered by other Handbooks in this series. But there are some things to be said\nabout them, purely from a policy perspective. Consider the question of why socialmovements seem eventually to run out of steam. Many of the reasons are rooted in\ntheir political sociology: they lose touch with their grass roots; they get outmaneuv-ered in the centres of power; and so on (Tarrow 1994). But another reason, surely, is\nthat they sometimes simply \u2018\u2018run out of ideas.\u2019\u2019 They no longer have any clear ideawhat they want, in policy terms. Winning the sympathies of legislators and their\nconstituents counts for naught, if movements cannot follow up with some speci Wc\ndraft bill to drop into the legislative hopper.\nThat was at least part of the story behind the waning of the civil rights and feminist\nmovements in the USA as sources of demand for legislative or administrative change.At some point there was a general sense, among policy makers and mass publics, that\nthere was simply not much more that could be done through legislation and publicadministration to Wx the undeniable problems of racial and sexual injustice that\nremained. The policy-making garbage can was simply empty of the crucial element of\u2018\u2018ideas.\u2019\u2019\nEven more narrowly focused advocacy coalitions experience the same phenomenon\nof \u2018\u2018running out of steam\u2019\u2019 for the lack of further ideas. Consider the case of the \u2018\u2018safety\ncoalition\u2019\u2019 so prominent in US policy making in the 1960s (Walker 1977). It\nWrst mobilized around the issue of coal mine safety. That was a problem that\nhad been widely discussed both in technical professional journals and in the wider\npublic for some time; everyone had a pretty clear understanding of the nature of the\nproblems and of what might constitute possible solutions. Having successfully\nenacted coal mine safety legislation, the safety coalition\u2014like any good denizen ofthe policy-making garbage can\u2014went looking for what to do next. Auto safety\nemerged. There, the issue was less \u2018\u2018ripe,\u2019\u2019 in the sense that there had been less\ndiscussion both in technical journals and in the public press. Still, auto safety\nlegislation was enacted. What to do next? The safety coalition then seized upon\n\u2018\u2018occupational health and safety,\u2019\u2019 an issue about which there had been very little public\ndiscussion and little technical scienti Wc discussion. A law was passed, but it was a law\nwith little general backing that in e Vect discredited the safety coalition and inhibited it\nfrom playing any serious role in public policy discussions for more than a decade to\ncome. It revived, in a di Verent guise, only after the accident at the Three Mile Island\nnuclear reactor.the public and its policies 25\n9. Puzzles, Problems, and Persuasion\n............................................................................................................................... ........................................................\nPolicy gets made in response to problems. But what is perceived as puzzling or\nproblematic is not predetermined or Wxed for all time. The public\u2019s policy agenda\nshifts as \u2018\u2018personal troubles\u2019\u2019 shift into and out of the realm of perceived \u2018\u2018socialproblems\u2019\u2019 (Mills 1959). In part, this is a matter of a gestalt shift as to \u2018\u2018whose problem\nit is.\u2019\u2019 And in part it is a matter of transforming sheer \u2018\u2018puzzles\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018actionableproblems:\u2019\u2019 if no solution can be envisaged, then for all practical purposes there\nsimply is no problem.\nThe \u2018\u2018progressive agenda\u2019\u2019 had the state assuming increasing responsibility for\npersonal troubles (Rose-Ackerman 1992; Crenson 1998). The watch-cry of the op-\nposite agenda is \u2018\u2018personal responsibility,\u2019\u2019 with the state washing its own hands ofresponsibility for \u2018\u2018personal troubles\u2019\u2019 ranging from health to income security (Wikler\n1987; Schmidtz and Goodin 1998). \u2018\u2018Deinstitutionalization\u2019\u2019\u2014the decanting of asy-\nlums\u2019 inmates into cardboard boxes across America\u2014is perhaps the saddest instance(Dear and Wolch 1987; Mechanic and Rochefort 1990). But in a way this twentieth-\ncentury morality play was just a re-enactment of the earlier processes by whichseventeenth-century poor laws emerged as a solution to the public nuisance of\nvagrancy, only to be shifted over subsequent centuries to punitive regimes of\nworkhouses in hopes of forcing the undeserving poor to take more responsibility\nfor their own lives (Blaug 1963).\nPolicy is sometimes simply overtaken by events. Whole swathes of policy regulat-\ning obsolete technologies become redundant with technological advances. Militarystrategies designed to contain one opponent become redundant, or worse, when\none\u2019s opponent shifts.\nPolicy disputes are often resolved by reframing. Lincoln\u2019s great genius, on one\naccount, was reframing the argument over slavery: not as one over abolitionism; but\nrather as one over the extension of slavery to new territories, and the dangers for free\nwhite men in having to compete there against cheap slave labour (Hofstadter 1948,\nch.5).\nPolicy proposals gain political traction by \u2018\u2018hitching a ride\u2019\u2019 on other policies more\nin tune with general social values. Described as \u2018\u2018a free lunch,\u2019\u2019 proposals for giving\neveryone a guaranteed basic income are politically dead in the water (Moynihan\n1973). Described as \u2018\u2018participation income,\u2019\u2019 paying people for socially useful work\u2014\nor better still, as a form of \u2018\u2018workfare\u2019\u2019\u2014the same policies might be real runners,politically (Atkinson 1996; Goodin 2001).\nPolicy disputes are as often resolved by some telling new fact. The rights and\nwrongs of policies of nuclear deterrence had been hotly contested, both morally and\nstrategically, for more than a quarter-century; but the unthinkable became truly\nunthinkable when Carl Sagan pointed out the risk that any large-scale use of nuclear\nweapons might initiate a \u2018\u2018nuclear winter\u2019\u2019 destroying all life even in the countryinitiating the attack (Sagan 1983\u20134; see also Sagan and Turco 1990). Or again: the26 robert e. goodin, martin rein & michael moran\nrights and wrongs of banning smoking in public places had been hotly contested for\nyears; but once the risks of \u2018\u2018passive smoking\u2019\u2019 became known, it ceased being a\nmatter of moral dispute and became a straightforward issue of preventing publicassaults (Goodin 1989).\nIssues cease being issues for all sorts of reasons: some good, some bad. \u2018\u2018Benign\nneglect\u2019\u2019 might have been the best way of treating all sorts of issues, ranging from race\nto abortion (Luker 1984). Making public policy can often be a mistake. But making\nan issue of child abuse and neglect was almost certainly not a mistake (Nelson 1984).\nThe di Verence between those cases is that in the former there was a real risk of\ncountermobilization undoing any good done by making de facto policies morepublic, whereas in the latter there seems little risk of countermobilization by or\neven on behalf of child abusers.\nThinking about the way issues become, or fail to become, policy \u2018\u2018problems\u2019\u2019 takes\nus right back to the heart of the argument about the persuasive vocation of policystudies. We have argued that the grounds for this persuasive conception are formid-\nable. They include the limits of instrumental rationality; the importance of deliber-\nation in policy formation; the overwhelming evidence of the way modern governing\nconditions demand a style of policy making that maximizes consultation and\nvoluntary coordination.\n\u2018\u2018High modernism\u2019\u2019 is an anachronism. Running modern government by its\ndictates is like trying to assemble motor cars on a replica of one of Ford\u2019s 1920s\nassembly lines\u2014a recipe for defective production, when interacting components arenot fully decomposable (Simon 1981).\nBut the pursuit of this persuasive vocation is a hard road to follow. It demands a\nunique combination of skills: the skills of \u2018\u2018normal\u2019\u2019 social science allied to the skills of\u2018\u2018rhetoric\u2019\u2019 in the best sense of that much misused word. And the persuasive vocation\nmust be practised in a hostile world. There is hostility from pressed decision makers\nwho feel impelled to make rapid decisions in the face of urgency or even crisis;\nhostility from the still powerful administrative doctrines associated with the high\nmodernist project; and hostility from entrenched powers and interests threatened by\nmore re Xective and inclusive modes of decision. Intellectually anachronistic doc-\ntrines continue to Xourish in the world of policy practice for a whole range of\nreasons, and all are applicable to the case of high modernism. Within bureaucracies\nand in the vastly rewarding consulting industries that have grown up around the NewPublic Management there is a huge investment\u2014intellectual and Wnancial\u2014in the\nmodernistic drive for measurement and hierarchical control (Power 1997). Individual\ncrazes still sweep across policy worlds because they o Ver possibilities of evading\ndemocratic control: the enthusiasm for evidence-based policy making in arenas likehealth care is a case in point (Harrison, Moran, and Wood 2002 ). And in the\npromotion of one key variant of high modernism\u2014globalization\u2014key global man-agement institutions like the World Bank and the IMF continue to promote stand-\nardized reform packages (Rodrik 1997; Stiglitz 2002 ; Cammack 2002 ).\nSo, in the end, the persuasive appeal comes back to power and interests. Which is\nto say, politics. Just as the founders of the policy sciences told us from the start.the public and its policies 27\nPolicy analysts use the imperfect tools of their trade not only to assist legitimately\nelected oY cials in implementing their democratic mandates, but also to empower\nsome groups rather than others. Furthermore, policy is never permanent, made once\nand for all time. Puzzles get transformed into actionable problems, and policies get\nmade on that basis. But that gives rise to further puzzlement, and the quest for ways\nof acting on those new problems. The persuasive task of policy making and analysis\nalike lodges in these dynamics of deciding which puzzle to solve, what counts as a\nsolution, and whose interests to serve.\nReferences\nAaron, H.

This report presents a comprehensive\nanalysis of various state-of-the-art methods that combine cutting-edge language models with so-\nphisticated retrieval techniques. Our objective is to eval uate and compare these methods based on\ntheir performance in two critical aspects: accuracy, as mea sured by the RobustQA average score\n(Han et al., 2023), and ef\ufb01ciency, determined by the average response time.\nWe have explored a diverse range of methods including Azure C ognitive Search Retriever integrated\nwith GPT-4,1Pinecone\u2019s Canopy framework,2various implementations of Langchain with Pinecone\nand different language models (OpenAI, Cohere),3,4LlamaIndex with Weaviate Vector Store\u2019s hy-\nbrid search,5Google\u2019s RAG implementation on Cloud VertexAI-Search,6Amazon SageMaker\u2019s\nRAG,7and a novel approach combining a graph search algorithm with a language model and re-\ntrieval awareness (Writer Retrieval).\nThe impetus for this analysis stems from the increasing dema nd for robust and responsive question-\nanswering systems in various domains, from customer servic e to academic research. As the com-\nplexity of queries and the volume of information grows, it be comes imperative to not only retrieve\nrelevant information quickly but also to ensure the precisi on and adaptability of the responses. The\nRobustQA metric (Han et al., 2023), a pivotal element in our a nalysis, offers a nuanced view of how\nwell these systems perform under diverse paraphrasing of qu estions, re\ufb02ecting real-world querying\nscenarios.\nThis report aims to provide insights into the strengths and w eaknesses of each method, drawing\ncomparisons that would help in understanding which combina tions of technologies and approaches\nare best suited for speci\ufb01c applications. By delving into pe rformance data, we aim to shed light\non the current state of AI-driven search and retrieval syste ms and to pave the way for informed\ndecisions in the deployment and development of these techno logies.\n1https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-opena i-demo\n2https://www.pinecone.io/blog/canopy-rag-framework/\n3https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vect orstores/pinecone\n4https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retr ievers/cohere\n5https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vecto r_stores/WeaviateIndexDemo-Hybrid.html\n6https://python.langchain.com/docs/templates/rag-goo gle-cloud-vertexai-search\n7https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quest ion-answering-using-retrieval-augmented-generation- with \nPreprint.

Passages\nconsists of 100 continuous tokens at most from the original d ocuments.\n2 Background\nIn the realm of natural language processing (NLP) and questi on-answering (QA) systems, the need\nfor robust and reliable evaluation metrics has always been p aramount. The RobustQA (Han et al.,\n2023) metric is a signi\ufb01cant step towards addressing this ne ed.\nRobustQA is an innovative framework designed to evaluate th e robustness of QA systems. It focuses\non assessing how well these systems handle diverse paraphra sings of questions. This approach is\ncrucial because real-world queries often come in various fo rms and styles, and a truly robust QA\nsystem must handle this variability effectively.\nThe framework employs a novel methodology that goes beyond t raditional evaluation metrics, which\noften rely on a limited set of question variations. RobustQA introduces a broader and more challeng-\ning set of paraphrased questions, thereby providing a more c omprehensive and realistic assessment\nof a QA system\u2019s performance.\nBy incorporating RobustQA into our evaluation of different language model integrations with search\nand retrieval systems, we aim to gain deeper insights into th eir real-world effectiveness. This ap-\nproach allows us to understand not only the accuracy of these systems in responding to queries but\nalso their adaptability and resilience to varied linguisti c expressions. Various statistics about the data\nin RobustQA are shown in Table 1.\n3 Experiments and Results\nIn our empirical evaluation, we rigorously assessed the ef\ufb01 cacy of eight different retrieval system\ncon\ufb01gurations by scrutinizing two primary dimensions: the RobustQA metric score and the response\ntime latency. Both metrics are salient indicators of the sys tems\u2019 pro\ufb01ciency in handling real-world\nquery scenarios with swiftness and precision. The technica l con\ufb01gurations tested ranged between\ndifferent combinations of search architectures, integrat ed language models, and indexing techniques.\nRobustQA Score Estimation: The RobustQA score computation leverages a precision-orie nted\nmethodology that quanti\ufb01es the systems\u2019 accuracy in retrie ving the correct response against a cor-\npus of paraphrased queries. This measure is calculated thro ugh an analytic comparison, where\neach system-generated response is benchmarked against a go ld-standard dataset that encapsulates\na broad spectrum of question paraphrases, re\ufb02ecting realis tic variance in linguistic expression. A\nhigh-resolution scoring mechanism, it accommodates shuf\ufb02 ed question sequences to mitigate posi-\ntion bias and ensure comprehensiveness in evaluation.\nResponse Time Measurement: This metric is quanti\ufb01ed by recording the interval from the i niti-\nation of the query request to the point when a complete respon se set is rendered to the end user.\nPrecision timers embedded within the system\u2019s operational pipeline log these intervals, capturing\nthe raw computational throughput and data retrieval cadenc e. This temporal metric critically re\ufb02ects\nthe operational ef\ufb01ciency and scalability of the system, wi th adjustments made for network latency\neffects to ensure the metric purity.\n2\nPipeline RobustQA\nAvg. scoreAvg. response\ntime (secs)\nAzure Cognitive Search Retriever + GPT4 + Ada 72.36 >1.0s\nCanopy (Pinecone) 59.61 >1.0s\nLangchain + Pinecone + OpenAI 61.42 <0.8s\nLangchain + Pinecone + Cohere 69.02 <0.6s\nLlamaIndex + Weaviate Vector Store - Hybrid Search 75.89 <1. 0s\nRAG Google Cloud VertexAI-Search + Bison 51.08 >0.8s\nRAG Amazon SageMaker 32.74 <2.0s\nGraph search algorithm + LLM + Retrieval awareness\n(Writer Retrieval)86.31 <0.6s\nTable 2: Comparison of different pipelines on RobustQA in te rms of both performance and response\ntime. Best scores are in bold.\nMoving to the experimental setup, each retrieval system con \ufb01guration was rigorously evaluated\nin a controlled test environment to ensure repeatability an d consistency. The subsequent report\nmeticulously tabulates these \ufb01ndings:\nAzure Cognitive Search Retriever + GPT4 + Ada8This combination shows a strong perfor-\nmance in terms of accuracy, indicating good integration bet ween Azure\u2019s search capabilities and\nGPT-4\u2019s Ada model. The response time is over one second, sugg esting a balance between thorough-\nness and speed.\nCanopy Pinecone)9The lower score here could indicate limitations in either th e Canopy frame-\nwork\u2019s retrieval ability or its integration with Pinecone. The response time is similar to the Azure\nCognitive Search setup.\nLangchain + Pinecone + OpenAI10This method shows a modest improvement in accuracy over\nCanopy, with a notably faster response time. The Langchain f ramework might be more ef\ufb01cient in\nquerying or processing results.\nLangchain + Pinecone + Cohere11This setup shows a signi\ufb01cant jump in accuracy and a further\nreduction in response time. The Cohere model\u2019s integration with Langchain and Pinecone seems\nparticularly effective.\nLlamaIndex + Weaviate Vecor Score - Hybrid Search12This method is second best in terms\nof accuracy, suggesting that LlamaIndex\u2019s hybrid search ap proach effectively leverages Weaviate\u2019s\nvector store capabilities. The sub-one-second response ti me also indicates ef\ufb01ciency.\nRAG Google Cloud VertexAI-Search + Bison13This combination shows the lowest accuracy,\nwhich might be due to how RAG and Bison interact or how they lev erage Google Cloud\u2019s VertexAI-\nSearch. The response time is moderate.\nRAG Amazon SageMaker14This setup has the lowest score and the longest response time , indi-\ncating possible inef\ufb01ciencies or mismatches in the integra tion of RAG with Amazon SageMaker.\nGraph search algorithm + LLM + Retrieval awareness (Writer R etrieval) This method out-\nperforms all others in accuracy while maintaining a fast res ponse time, highlighting the effectiveness\nof combining a graph search algorithm with a language model a nd retrieval awareness.\n8https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-opena i-demo\n9https://www.pinecone.io/blog/canopy-rag-framework/\n10https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vect orstores/pinecone\n11https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/retr ievers/cohere\n12https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/vecto r_stores/WeaviateIndexDemo-Hybrid.html\n13https://python.langchain.com/docs/templates/rag-goo gle-cloud-vertexai-search\n14https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/quest ion-answering-using-retrieval-augmented-generation- with \n3\nAzure+GPT4+Ada Canopy (Pinecone)\nLangchain+Pinecone+OpenAILangchain+Pinecone+CohereLlamaIndex+Weaviate\nRAG-Google-VertexAI+BisonRAG Amazon SageMakerWriter Retrieval020406080RobustQA Avg.ScoreRobustQA Avg.

It juxtaposes the RobustQA ave rage score (in blue bars) and average\nresponse time (in red line with markers) for each method. Thi s visualization aids in understanding\nhow each method performs in terms of accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency. The Graph search algorithm with\nLLM and Retrieval awareness (Writer Retrieval) stands out a s the most effective method, balancing\nhigh accuracy with quick response times. LlamaIndex with We aviate Vector Store is also notable\nfor its high accuracy. On the other hand, RAG implementation s (both Google Cloud and Amazon\nSageMaker) lag in performance. This analysis suggests a tre nd where specialized retrieval-aware\nmethods combined with ef\ufb01cient language models lead to bett er performance in both accuracy and\nresponse time.\nReferences\nRujun Han, Peng Qi, Yuhao Zhang, Lan Liu, Juliette Burger,\nWilliam Yang Wang, Zhiheng Huang, Bing Xiang, and Dan Roth. 2 023.\nRobustQA: Benchmarking the robustness of domain adaptatio n for open-domain question answering.\nInFindings of the Association for Computational Linguistics : ACL 2023 , pages 4294\u20134311,\nToronto, Canada.

Neuroscienceencompasses approaches ranging from molecular and cellular studies tohuman psychophysics and psychology. Theoretical neuroscience encour-ages cross-talk among these sub-disciplines by constructing compact rep-resentations of what has been learned, building bridges between differentlevels of description, and identifying unifying concepts and principles. Inthis book, we present the basic methods used for these purposes and dis-cuss examples in which theoretical approaches have yielded insight intonervous system function.\nThe questions what, how, and why are addressed by descriptive, mecha-\nnistic, and interpretive models, each of which we discuss in the followingchapters. Descriptive models summarize large amounts of experimental descriptive models\ndata compactly yet accurately, thereby characterizing what neurons andneural circuits do. These models may be based loosely on biophysical,anatomical, and physiological \ufb01ndings, but their primary purpose is to de-\nscribe phenomena not to explain them. Mechanistic models, on the other mechanistic models\nhand, address the question of how nervous systems operate on the ba-sis of known anatomy, physiology, and circuitry. Such models often forma bridge between descriptive models couched at different levels. Inter-pretive models use computational and information-theoretic principles to interpretive models\nexplore the behavioral and cognitive signi \ufb01cance of various aspects of ner-\nvous system function, addressing the question of why nervous system op-erate as they do.\nIt is often dif \ufb01cul to identify the appropriate level of modeling for a partic-\nular problem. A frequent mistake is to assume that a more detailed modelis necessarily superior. Because models act as bridges between levels ofunderstanding, they must be detailed enough to make contact with thelower level yet simple enough to yield clear results at the higher level.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2\nOrganization and Approach\nThis book is organized into three parts on the basis of general themes.\nPart I (chapters 1-4) is devoted to the coding of information by actionpotentials and the represention of information by populations of neuronswith selective responses. Modeling of neurons and neural circuits on thebasis of cellular and synaptic biophysics is presented in part II (chapters5-7). The role of plasticity in development and learning is discussed inPart III (chapters 8-10). With the exception of chapters 5 and 6, whichjointly cover neuronal modeling, the chapters are largely independent andcan be selected and ordered in a variety of ways for a one- or two-semestercourse at either the undergraduate or graduate level.\nAlthough we provide some background material, readers without previ-\nous exposure to neuroscience should refer to a neuroscience textbook suchas Kandel, Schwartz & Jessell (2000); Nicholls, Martin & Wallace (1992);Bear, Connors & Paradiso (1996); Shepherd (1997); Zigmond, Bloom, Lan-dis & Squire (1998); Purves et al (2000).\nTheoretical neuroscience is based on the belief that methods of mathemat-\nics, physics, and computer science can elucidate nervous system function.Unfortunately, mathematics can sometimes seem more of an obstacle thanan aid to understanding. We have not hesitated to employ the level ofanalysis needed to be precise and rigorous. At times, this may stretch thetolerance of some of our readers. We encourage such readers to consultthe mathematical appendix, which provides a brief review of most of themathematical methods used in the text, but also to persevere and attemptto understand the implications and consequences of a dif \ufb01cult derivation\neven if its steps are unclear.\nTheoretical neuroscience, like any skill, can only be mastered with prac-\ntice. We have provided exercises for this purpose on the web site for thisbook and urge the reader to do them. In addition, it will be highly in-structive for the reader to construct the models discussed in the text andexplore their properties beyond what we have been able to do in the avail-able space.\nReferencing\nIn order to maintain the \ufb02ow of the text, we have kept citations within\nthe chapters to a minimum. Each chapter ends with an annotated bib-liography containing suggestions for further reading (which are denotedby a bold font), information about work cited within the chapter, and ref-erences to related studies. We concentrate on introducing the basic toolsof computational neuroscience and discussing applications that we thinkbest help the reader to understand and appreciate them. This means thata number of systems where computational approaches have been applied\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3\nwith signi \ufb01cant success are not discussed. References given in the anno-\ntated bibliographies lead the reader toward such applications. In mostof the areas we cover, many people have provided critical insights.

They do this by generat-ing characteristic electrical pulses called action potentials, or more simplyspikes, that can travel down nerve \ufb01bers. Neurons represent and transmit\ninformation by \ufb01ring sequences of spikes in various temporal patterns.\nThe study of neural coding, which is the subject of the \ufb01rst four chapters of\nthis book, involves measuring and characterizing how stimulus attributes,such as light or sound intensity, or motor actions, such as the direction ofan arm movement, are represented by action potentials.\nThe link between stimulus and response can be studied from two opposite\npoints of view. Neural encoding, the subject of chapters 1 and 2, refers tothe map from stimulus to response. For example, we can catalogue howneurons respond to a wide variety of stimuli, and then construct modelsthat attempt to predict responses to other stimuli. Neural decoding refersto the reverse map, from response to stimulus, and the challenge is to re-construct a stimulus, or certain aspects of that stimulus, from the spikesequences it evokes. Neural decoding is discussed in chapter 3. In chapter4, we consider how the amount of information encoded by sequences ofaction potentials can be quanti \ufb01ed and maximized. Before embarking on\nthis tour of neural coding, we brie \ufb02y review how neurons generate their\nresponses and discuss how neural activity is recorded. The biophysicalmechanisms underlying neural responses and action potential generationare treated in greater detail in chapters 5 and 6.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nProperties of Neurons\nNeurons are highly specialized for generating electrical signals in response\nto chemical and other inputs, and transmitting them to other cells. Someimportant morphological specializations, seen in the drawings of \ufb01gure\n1.1, are the dendrites that receive inputs from other neurons and the axonthat carries the neuronal output to other cells. The elaborate branchingstructure of the dendritic tree allows a neuron to receive inputs from manyother neurons through synaptic connections. The cortical pyramidal neu-ron of \ufb01gure 1.1A and the cortical interneuron of \ufb01gure 1.1C each receives\nthousands of synaptic inputs, and for the cerebellar Purkinje cell of \ufb01gure\n1.1B the number is over 100,000. Figure 1.1 does not show the full extent of axons and\ndendrites the axons of these neurons. Axons from single neurons can traverse large\nfractions of the brain or, in some cases, of the entire body. In the mousebrain, it has been estimated that cortical neurons typically send out a totalof about 40 mm of axon and have approximately 4 mm of total dendriticcable in their branched dendritic trees. The axon makes an average of 180synaptic connections with other neurons per mm of length while the den-dritic tree receives, on average, 2 synaptic inputs per\n\u00b5m. The cell body or\nsoma of a typical cortical neurons ranges in diameter from about 10 to 50\n\u00b5m.\nAlong with these morphological features, neurons have physiological\nspecializations. Most prominent among these are a wide variety ofmembrane-spanning ion channels that allow ions, predominantly sodium ion channels\n(Na\n+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), and chloride (Cl\u2212), to move into\nand out of the cell. Ion channels control the \ufb02ow of ions across the cell\nmembrane by opening and closing in response to voltage changes andboth internal and external signals.\nThe electrical signal of relevance to the nervous system is the difference\nin electrical potential between the interior of a neuron and the surround-ing extracellular medium. Under resting conditions, the potential insidethe cell membrane of a neuron is about -70 mV relative to that of the sur-rounding bath (which is conventionally de \ufb01ned to be 0 mV), and the cell\nis said to be polarized. Ion pumps located in the cell membrane maintain membrane\npotential concentration gradients that support this membrane potential difference.\nFor example, Na\n+is much more concentrated outside a neuron than in-\nside it, and the concentration of K+is signi \ufb01cantly higher inside the neu-\nron than in the extracellular medium. Ions thus \ufb02ow into and out of a\ncell due to both voltage and concentration gradients. Current, in the formof positively charged ions \ufb02owing out of the cell (or negatively charged\nions\ufb02owing into the cell) through open channels makes the membrane\npotential more negative, a process called hyperpolarization. Current \ufb02ow- hyperpolarization\nand depolarization ing into the cell changes the membrane potential to less negative or even\npositive values. This is called depolarization.\nIf a neuron is depolarized suf \ufb01ciently to raise the membrane potential\nabove a threshold level, a positive feedback process is initiated, and the\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

An action potential is a roughly 100 action potential\nmV\ufb02uctuation in the electrical potential across the cell membrane that\nlasts for about 1 ms ( \ufb01gure 1.2A). Action potential generation also depends\non the recent history of cell \ufb01ring. For a few milliseconds just after an\naction potential has been \ufb01red, it may be virtually impossible to initiate\nanother spike. This is called the absolute refractory period. For a longerinterval known as the relative refractory period, lasting up to tens of mil- refractory period\nliseconds after a spike, it is more dif \ufb01cult to evoke an action potential.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nmicrotubules\nmitochondrion\nsynaptic\nvesicles\ncleft\ndendritedendritic\nspecializationaxon terminalof presynapticneuron\ndendritic spine\nof postsynapticneuron\n-60-40-20020membrane potential (mV)\n200 100 0\ntime (ms)A B\nFigure 1.2: A) An action potential recorded intracellularly from a cultured rat\nneocortical pyramidal cell. B) Diagram of a synapse. The axon terminal or bou-ton is at the end of the axonal branch seen entering from the top of the \ufb01gure.\nIt is\ufb01lled with synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter that is released\nwhen an action potential arrives from the presynaptic neuron. Transmitter crossesthe synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the dendritic spine, a roughly 1\n\u00b5m\nlong process extending from the dendrite of the postsynaptic neuron. Excitatorysynapses onto cortical pyramidal cells form on dendritic spines as shown here.Other synapses form directly on the dendrites, axon, or soma of the postsynapticneuron. (A recorded by L. Rutherford in the laboratory of G. Turrigiano. B adaptedfrom Kandel et al., 1991.)\nAction potentials are of great importance because they are the only form\nof membrane potential \ufb02uctuation that can propagate over large distances.\nSubthreshold potential \ufb02uctuations are severely attenuated over distances\nof 1 mm or less. Action potentials, on the other hand, are regeneratedactively along axon processes and can travel rapidly over large distanceswithout attenuation.\nAxons terminate at synapses where the voltage transient of the action po- synapse\ntential opens ion channels producing an in \ufb02ux of Ca\n2+that leads to the\nrelease of a neurotransmitter ( \ufb01gure 1.2B). The neurotransmitter binds to\nreceptors at the signal receiving or postsynaptic side of the synapse caus-ing ion-conducting channels to open. Depending on the nature of the ion\ufb02ow, the synapses can have either an excitatory, depolarizing, or an in-\nhibitory, typically hyperpolarizing, effect on the postsynaptic neuron.\nRecording Neuronal Responses\nFigure 1.3 illustrates intracellular and extracellular methods for recordingneuronal responses electrically (they can also be recorded optically).

The middle traceis a simulated extracellular recording. Action potentials appear as roughly equalpositive and negative potential \ufb02uctuations with an amplitude of around 0.1 mV.\nThis is roughly 1000 times smaller than the approximately 0.1 V amplitude of anintracellularly recorded action potential. (Neuron drawing is the same as \ufb01gure\n1.1A.)\nbrane potentials are measured intracellularly by connecting to a neuron a\nhollow glass electrode \ufb01lled with a conducting electrolyte, and comparing\nthe potential it records to that of a reference electrode placed in the extra-cellular medium. Intracellular recordings are made either with sharp elec- sharp and patch\nelectrodes trodes inserted through the membrane into the cell, or patch electrodes\nthat have broader tips and are sealed tightly to the surface of the mem-brane. After the patch electrode seals, the membrane beneath its tip iseither broken or perforated providing electrical contact with the interiorof the cell.

These traces are drawings, not real recordings, and such intracellularaxon recordings, although possible in some types of cells, are dif \ufb01cult and\nrare. Intracellular recordings from the soma are the norm, but intracel-lular dendritic recordings are increasingly being made as well. The sub-threshold membrane potential waveform, apparent in the soma record-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\ning, is completely absent on the axon due to attenuation, but the action\npotential sequence in the two recordings is the same. This illustrates theimportant point that spikes, but not subthreshold potentials, propagateregeneratively down axons.\nT h em i d d l et r a c ei n \ufb01gure 1.3 illustrates an idealized, noise-free extracel-\nlular recording. Here an electrode is placed near a neuron but it does notpenetrate the cell membrane. Such recordings can reveal the action poten- extracellular\nelectrodes tials\ufb01red by a neuron, but not its subthreshold membrane potentials. Ex-\ntracellular recordings are typically used for in vivo experiments, especially\nthose involving behaving animals. Intracellular recordings are sometimesmade in vivo , but are more commonly used for in vitro preparations such\nas experiments on slices of neural tissue. The responses studied in thischapter are action potential sequences that can be recorded either intra- orextra-cellularly.\nFrom Stimulus to Response\nCharacterizing the relationship between stimulus and response is dif \ufb01cult\nbecause neuronal responses are complex and variable. Neurons typicallyrespond by producing complex spike sequences that re \ufb02ect both the intrin-\nsic dynamics of the neuron and the temporal characteristics of the stimu-lus. Isolating features of the response that encode changes in the stimulusc a nb ed i f \ufb01cult, especially if the time scale for these changes is of the same\norder as the average interval between spikes. Neural responses can varyfrom trial to trial even when the same stimulus is presented repeatedly.There are many potential sources of this variability including variable lev-els of arousal and attention, randomness associated with various biophys-ical processes that affect neuronal \ufb01ring, and the effects of other cognitive\nprocesses taking place during a trial. The complexity and trial-to-trial vari-ability of action potential sequences make it unlikely that we can describeand predict the timing of each spike deterministically. Instead, we seek amodel that can account for the probabilities that different spike sequencesare evoked by a speci \ufb01c stimulus.\nTypically, many neurons respond to a given stimulus, and stimulus fea-\ntures are therefore encoded by the activities of large neural populations. Instudying population coding, we must examine not only the \ufb01ring patterns\nof individual neurons, but also the relationships of these \ufb01ring patterns to\neach other across the population of responding cells.\nIn this chapter, we introduce the \ufb01ring rate and spike-train correlation\nfunctions, which are basic measures of spiking probability and statistics.We also discuss spike-triggered averaging, a method for relating actionpotentials to the stimulus that evoked them. Finally, we present basicstochastic descriptions of spike generation, the homogeneous and inho-mogeneous Poisson models, and discuss a simple model of neural re-sponses to which they lead. In chapter 2, we continue our discussion of\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Although ac-tion potentials can vary somewhat in duration, amplitude, and shape,they are typically treated in neural encoding studies as identical stereo-typed events. If we ignore the brief duration of an action potential (about1 ms), an action potential sequence can be characterized simply by a listof the times when spikes occurred. For nspikes, we denote these times\nbyt\niwith i=1,2,..., n. The trial during which the spikes are recorded\nis taken to start at time zero and end at time T,s o0\u2264ti\u2264Tfor all i.T h e\nspike sequence can also be represented as a sum of in \ufb01nitesimally narrow,\nidealized spikes in the form of Dirac \u03b4functions (see the Mathematical\nAppendix),\n\u03c1(t)=n/summationdisplay\ni=1\u03b4(t\u2212ti). (1.1)\nWe call \u03c1(t)the neural response function and use it to re-express sums neural response\nfunction \u03c1(t) over spikes as integrals over time. For example, for any well-behavedfunction h\n(t), we can write\nn/summationdisplay\ni=1h(t\u2212ti)=/integraldisplayT\n0d\u03c4h(\u03c4)\u03c1( t\u2212\u03c4) (1.2)\nwhere the integral is over the duration of the trial. The equality follows\nfrom the basic de \ufb01ning equation for a \u03b4function, \u03b4function\n/integraldisplay\nd\u03c4\u03b4(t\u2212\u03c4)h(\u03c4)=h(t), (1.3)\nprovided that the limits of the integral surround the point t(if they do not,\nthe integral is zero).\nBecause the sequence of action potentials generated by a given stimulus\ntypically varies from trial to trial, neuronal responses are typically treatedprobabilistically, and characterized, for example, by the probability that aspike occurs at a particular time during a trial. Spike times are continuousvariables, and, as a result, the probability for a spike to occur at any pre-cisely speci \ufb01ed time is actually zero. To get a nonzero value, we must ask\nfor the probability that a spike occurs within a speci \ufb01ed interval, for exam-\nple the interval between times tand t\n+/Delta1t. For small /Delta1t, the probability\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nof a spike falling in this interval is proportional to the size of the interval,\n/Delta1t. A similar relation holds for any continuous stochastic variable z.T h e\nprobability that ztakes a value between zand z+/Delta1z, for small /Delta1z(strictly\nspeaking, as /Delta1z\u21920) is equal to p[z]/Delta1z, where p[z] is called a probability\ndensity. Throughout this book, we use the notation P[ ] to denote proba-\nbilities and p[ ] to denote probability densities. We use the bracket nota-\ntion, P[ ], generically for the probability of something occurring and also\nto denote a speci \ufb01c probability function. In the latter case, the notation\nP()would be more appropriate, but switching between square brackets\nand parentheses is confusing, so the reader will have to use the context todistinguish between these cases.\nFor the particular case of spike occurrences, we can write the probability\nthat a spike occurs between times tand t\n+/Delta1t, for small /Delta1tasp[t]/Delta1t,\nwhere p[t] is the single spike probability density. The probability density\nfor the occurrence of a spike is, by de \ufb01nition, the \ufb01ring rate of the cell, and\nwe use the notation p[t]=r(t)for this important quantity. \ufb01ring rate r(t)\nThe\ufb01ring rate at time t,r(t), can be estimated by determining the frac-\ntion of trials with a given stimulus on which a spike occurred between thetimes tand t\n+/Delta1t. For suf \ufb01ciently small /Delta1tand suf \ufb01ciently large num-\nbers of trials, this fraction provides a good estimate of r(t), as guaranteed\nby the law of large numbers. The fraction of trials on which a spike oc-curs can be computed from the neural response function averaged overtrials. We use angle brackets,\n/angbracketleft/angbracketright, to denote averages over trials that use trial average /angbracketleft/angbracketright\nthe same stimulus, so that /angbracketleftz/angbracketrightfor any quantity zis the sum of the values\nofzobtained from many trials involving the same stimulus, divided by\nthe number of trials. The trial-averaged neural response function is thusdenoted by\n/angbracketleft\u03c1(t)/angbracketright. In any integral expression such as equation 1.2, the\nneural response function generates a contribution whenever a spike oc-curs. If instead, we use the trial-average response function in equation 1.2,this generates contributions proportional to the fraction of trials on whicha spike occurred. Because of the relationship between this fraction and the\ufb01ring rate, we \ufb01nd that\nr\n(t)/Delta1t=/integraldisplayt+/Delta1t\ntd\u03c4/angbracketleft\u03c1(\u03c4)/angbracketright. (1.4)\nFurthermore, within any well-behaved integral, we can replace the trial-\naveraged neural response function by the single-spike probability densityor\ufb01ring rate and write\n/integraldisplay\nd\n\u03c4h(\u03c4)/angbracketleft\u03c1(t\u2212\u03c4)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay\nd\u03c4h(\u03c4)r(t\u2212\u03c4) (1.5)\nfor any function h. This establishes an important relationship between the\naverage neural response function and the \ufb01ring rate; the two are equiva-\nlent when used inside integrals.\nWe call the single-spike probability density, r(t),t h e\ufb01ring rate. However,\nthis term is conventionally applied to more than one quantity. A differ-\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.2 Spike Trains and Firing Rates 9\nent\ufb01ring rate, which we call the spike-count rate, is obtained simply by\ncounting the number of action potentials that appear during a trial anddividing by the duration of the trial. Unlike r\n(t), the spike-count rate can\nbe determined for a single trial. We denote the spike-count rate by r(as spike-count rate r\nopposed to r(t)for the single-spike probability density) where\nr=n\nT=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0d\u03c4\u03c1(\u03c4). (1.6)\nThe second equality follows from the fact that/integraltext\nd\u03c4\u03c1(\u03c4) =nand indicates\nthat the spike-count rate is the time average of the neural response func-tion over the duration of the trial.\nIn the same way that the response function\n\u03c1(t)can be averaged across\ntrials to give the \ufb01ring rate r(t), the spike-count \ufb01ring rate can be averaged\nover trials yielding a quantity that we refer to as the average \ufb01ring rate.\nThis is denoted by /angbracketleftr/angbracketrightand given by trial average\nrate/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright=/angbracketleftn/angbracketright\nT=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0d\u03c4/angbracketleft\u03c1(\u03c4)/angbracketright=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dtr(t). (1.7)\nThe third equality follows from the equivalence of the \ufb01ring rate and the\ntrial averaged neural response function within integrals, equation 1.5. Theaverage \ufb01ring rate is equal to both the time average of r\n(t)and the trial\naverage of the spike-count rate r. Of course, a spike-count rate and average\n\ufb01ring rate can be de \ufb01ned by counting spikes over any time period, not\nnecessarily the entire duration of a trial.\nThe term \ufb01ring rate is commonly used for all three quantities, r(t),r, and\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright.W eu s et h et e r m s \ufb01ring rate, spike-count rate, and average \ufb01ring rate\nforr(t),r, and/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightrespectively whenever possible but, when this becomes\ntoo cumbersome, the different mathematical notations serve to distinguishthem. In particular, we distinguish the spike-count rate rfrom the single-\nspike probability density r\n(t)by using a different font and by including\nthe time argument in the latter expression (unless r(t)is independent of\ntime). The difference between the fonts is rather subtle, but the contextshould make it clear which rate is being used.\nMeasuring Firing Rates\nThe\ufb01ring rate r(t), being a probability density, cannot be determined ex-\nactly from the limited amounts of data available from a \ufb01nite number of\ntrials. In addition, there is no unique way to approximate r(t). A discus-\nsion of the different methods allows us to introduce the concept of a linear\ufb01lter and kernel that will be used extensively in the following chapters.\nWe illustrate these methods by extracting \ufb01ring rates from a single trial,\nbut more accurate results could be obtained by averaging over multipletrials.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nFigure 1.4 compares a number of ways of approximating r(t)from a spike\nsequence. Figure 1.4A shows three seconds of the response of a neuronin the inferior temporal cortex recorded while a monkey watched a video.Neurons in the region of cortex where this recording was made are selec-tive for complex visual images including faces. A simple way of extractingan estimate of the \ufb01ring rate from a spike train like this is to divide time\ninto discrete bins of duration\n/Delta1t, count the number of spikes within each\nbin, and divide by /Delta1t. Figure 1.4B shows the approximate \ufb01ring rate com-\nputed using this procedure with a bin size of 100 ms. Note that, withthis procedure, the quantity being computed is really the spike-count \ufb01r-\ning rate over the duration of the bin, and that the \ufb01ring rate r\n(t)within a\ngiven bin is approximated by this spike-count rate.\n100\n50\n0rate (Hz)\n3.0 2.5 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0\ntime (s)100\n50\n0rate (Hz)100\n50\n0rate (Hz)\n100\n50\n0rate (Hz) spikesA\nC\nD\nEB\nFigure 1.4: Firing rates approximated by different procedures.

Because spike counts can only take integer val-\nues, the rates computed by this method will always be integer multiplesof 1\n//Delta1t, and thus they take discrete values. Decreasing the value of /Delta1t\nincreases temporal resolution by providing an estimate of the \ufb01ring rate at\nmore \ufb01nely spaced intervals of time, but at the expense of decreasing the\nresolution for distinguishing different rates. One way to avoid quantized\ufb01ring rates is to vary the bin size so that a \ufb01xed number of spikes appears\nin each bin. The \ufb01ring rate is then approximated as that \ufb01xed number of\nspikes divided by the variable bin width.\nCounting spikes in preassigned bins produces a \ufb01ring-rate estimate that\ndepends not only on the size of the time bins, but also on their place-ment. To avoid the arbitrariness in the placement of bins, we can insteadtake a single bin or window of duration\n/Delta1tand slide it along the spike\ntrain, counting the number of spikes within the window at each location.The jagged curve in \ufb01gure 1.4C shows the result of sliding a 100 ms wide\nwindow along the spike train.

An approximate \ufb01ring rate\ncan be computed using virtually any window function w(\u03c4) that goes to\nzero outside a region near \u03c4=0 provided that its time integral is equal\nto one. For example, instead of the rectangular window function used in\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\n\ufb01gure 1.4C, w(\u03c4) c a nb eaG a u s s i a n\nw(\u03c4)=1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3wexp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212\u03c42\n2\u03c32w/parenrightbigg\n. (1.11)\nIn this case, \u03c3wcontrols the temporal resolution of the resulting rate, play-\ning a role analogous to /Delta1t. A continuous window function like the Gaus-\nsian used in equation 1.8 generates a \ufb01ring-rate estimate that is a smooth\nfunction of time ( \ufb01gure 1.4D).\nBoth the rectangular and Gaussian window functions approximate the \ufb01r-\ning rate at any time using spikes \ufb01red both before and after that time. A\npostsynaptic neuron monitoring the spike train of a presynaptic cell onlyhas access to spikes that have previously occurred. An approximation ofthe\ufb01ring rate at time tthat only depends on spikes \ufb01red before tcan be\ncalculated using a window function that vanishes when its argument isnegative. Such a window function or kernel is called causal.

In this chapter, we characterize responses of neurons as func-tions of just one of the stimulus attributes to which they may be sensitive. stimulus s\nThe value of this single attribute is denoted by s.I nc h a p t e r2 ,w ec o n s i d e r\nmore complete stimulus characterizations.\nA simple way of characterizing the response of a neuron is to count the\nnumber of action potentials \ufb01red during the presentation of a stimulus.\nThis approach is most appropriate if the parameter scharacterizing the\nstimulus is held constant over the trial. If we average the number of actionpotentials \ufb01red over (in theory, an in \ufb01nite number of) trials and divide by\nthe trial duration, we obtain the average \ufb01ring rate,\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightde\ufb01ned in equation\n1.7. The average \ufb01ring rate written as a function of s,/angbracketleftr/angbracketright= f(s), is called\nthe neural response tuning curve. The functional form of a tuning curve response tuning\ncurve f (s) depends on the parameter sused to describe the stimulus. The precise\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.2 Spike Trains and Firing Rates 13\nchoice of parameters used as arguments of tuning curve functions is par-\ntially a matter of convention. Because tuning curves correspond to \ufb01ring\nrates, they are measured in units of spikes per second or Hz.\nFigure 1.5A shows extracellular recordings of a neuron in the primary vi- primary visual\ncortex V1 sual cortex (V1) of a monkey. While these recordings were being made, a\nbar of light was moved at different angles across the region of the visual\ufb01eld where the cell responded to light. This region is called the recep-\ntive\ufb01eld of the neuron. Note that the number of action potentials \ufb01red\ndepends on the angle of orientation of the bar. The same effect is shownin\ufb01gure 1.5B in the form of a response tuning curve, which indicates how\nthe average \ufb01ring rate depends on the orientation of the light bar stimulus.\nThe data have been \ufb01t by a response tuning curve of the form\nA\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-40 -20 0 20 40\ns (orientation angle in degrees)f (Hz)B\nFigure 1.5: A) Recordings from a neuron in the primary visual cortex of a monkey.\nA bar of light was moved across the receptive \ufb01eld of the cell at different angles.\nThe diagrams to the left of each trace show the receptive \ufb01eld as a dashed square\nand the light source as a black bar.

Figure 1.6A shows an example of ex-tracellular recordings from a neuron in primary motor cortex in a monkey primary motor\ncortex M1 that has been trained to reach in different directions. The stacked traces for\neach direction are rasters showing the results of \ufb01ve different trials. The\nhorizontal axis in these traces represents time, and each mark indicatesan action potential. The \ufb01ring pattern of the cell, in particular the rate at\nwhich spikes are generated, is correlated with the direction of arm move-ment and thus encodes information about this aspect of the motor action.\nA60\n50\n40302010\n0\n350300250200150100500\ns (movement direction in degrees)f (Hz)B\nFigure 1.6: A) Recordings from the primary motor cortex of a monkey performing\nan arm reaching task.

The curve is a \ufb01t using the function 1.15 with parameters r\nmax=54.69\nHz,r0=32.34 Hz, and smax=161.25\u25e6. (A adapted from Georgopoulos et al., 1982\nwhich is also the source of the data points in B.)\nFigure 1.6B shows the response tuning curve of an M1 neuron plotted as\na function of the direction of arm movement. Here the data points have cosine\ntuning curve been \ufb01t by a tuning curve of the form\nf(s)=r0+(rmax\u2212r0)cos(s\u2212smax) (1.15)\nwhere sis the reaching angle of the arm, smaxis the reaching angle associ-\nated with the maximum response rmax, and r0is an offset or background\n\ufb01ring rate that shifts the tuning curve up from the zero axis. The minimum\n\ufb01ring rate predicted by equation 1.15 is 2 r0\u2212rmax. For the neuron of \ufb01gure\n1.6B, this is a positive quantity, but for some M1 neurons 2 r0\u2212rmax<0,\nand the function 1.15 is negative over some range of angles. Because \ufb01r-\ning rates cannot be negative, the cosine tuning curve must be half-waverecti\ufb01ed in these cases (see equation 1.13),\nf\n(s)=[r0+(rmax\u2212r0)cos(s\u2212smax)]+.

The image from\nthe\ufb01xation point falls at the fovea in each eye, the small pit where the black lines\nmeet the retina.

B) Average \ufb01ring rate of a cat V1 neuron responding to separate bars\nof light illuminating each eye plotted as a function of the disparity. Because thisneuron \ufb01res for positive svalues it is called a far-tuned cell. The curve is a \ufb01t using\nthe function 1.17 with parameters r\nmax=36.03 Hz, s1/2=0.036\u25e6, and/Delta1s=0.029\u25e6.\n(A adapted from Wandell, 1995; B data points from Poggio and Talbot, 1981.)\nRetinal disparity is a difference in the retinal location of an image between\nthe two eyes ( \ufb01gure 1.7A). Some neurons in area V1 are sensitive to dispar-\nity, representing an early stage in the representation of viewing distance.In\ufb01gure 1.7B, the data points have been \ufb01t with a tuning curve called a sigmoidal\ntuning curve logistic or sigmoidal function,\nf\n(s)=rmax\n1+exp/parenleftbig(s1/2\u2212s)//Delta1 s/parenrightbig. (1.17)\nIn this case, sis the retinal disparity, the parameter s1/2is the disparity\nthat produces a \ufb01ring rate half as big as the maximum value rmax, and/Delta1s\ncontrols how quickly the \ufb01ring rate increases as a function of s.I f/Delta1sis\nnegative, the \ufb01ring rate is a monotonically decreasing function of srather\nthan a monotonically increasing function as in \ufb01gure 1.7B.\nSpike-Count Variability\nTuning curves allow us to predict the average \ufb01ring rate, but they do not\ndescribe how the spike-count \ufb01ring rate rvaries about its mean value\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright= f(s)from trial to trial. While the map from stimulus to average\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nresponse may be described deterministically, it is likely that single-trial\nresponses such as spike-count rates can only be modeled in a probabilis-tic manner. For example, rvalues can be generated from a probability\ndistribution with mean f\n(s). The trial-to-trial deviation of rfrom f(s)is\nconsidered to be noise, and such models are often called noise models.The standard deviation for the noise distribution can either be indepen-dent of f\n(s), in which case the variability is called additive noise, or it can\ndepend on f(s). Multiplicative noise corresponds to having the standard\ndeviation proportional to f(s).\nResponse variability extends beyond the level of spike counts to the entire\ntemporal pattern of action potentials. Later in this chapter, we discuss amodel of the neuronal response that uses a stochastic spike generator toproduce response variability. This approach takes a deterministic estimateof the \ufb01ring rate, r\nest(t), and produces a stochastic spiking pattern from\nit. The spike generator produces variable numbers and patterns of actionpotentials, even if the same estimated \ufb01ring rate is used on each trial.\n1.3 What Makes a Neuron Fire?\nResponse tuning curves characterize the average response of a neuron to\na given stimulus. We now consider the complementary procedure of av-eraging the stimuli that produce a given response. To average stimuli inthis way, we need to specify what \ufb01xed response we will use to \u2018trigger\u2019\nthe average. The most obvious choice is the \ufb01ring of an action potential.\nThus, we ask, \u201cwhat on average did the stimulus do before an action po-tential was \ufb01red?\u201d The resulting quantity, called the spike-triggered aver-\nage stimulus, provides a useful way of characterizing neuronal selectivity.Spike-triggered averages are computed using stimuli characterized by aparameter s\n(t)that varies over time. Before beginning our discussion of\nspike triggering, we describe some features of such stimuli.\nDescribing the Stimulus\nNeurons responding to sensory stimuli face the dif \ufb01cult task of encoding\nparameters that can vary over an enormous dynamic range. For example,photoreceptors in the retina can respond to single photons or can oper-ate in bright light with an in \ufb02ux of millions of photons per second. To\ndeal with such wide-ranging stimuli, sensory neurons often respond moststrongly to rapid changes in stimulus properties and are relatively insen-sitive to steady-state levels. Steady-state responses are highly compressedfunctions of stimulus intensity, typically with logarithmic or weak power-law dependences. This compression has an interesting psychophysicalcorrelate. Weber measured how different the intensity of two stimuli hadto be for them to be reliably discriminated, the \u2018just noticeable\u2019 difference\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.3 What Makes a Neuron Fire? 17\n/Delta1s. He found that, for a given stimulus, /Delta1swas proportional to the magni-\ntude of the stimulus s, so that /Delta1s/swas constant. This relationship is called\nWeber\u2019s law. Fechner suggested that noticeable differences set the scale for Weber\u2019s law\nperceived stimulus intensities. Integrating Weber\u2019s law, this means thatthe perceived intensity of a stimulus of absolute intensity svaries as log s,\nand this is known as Fechner\u2019s law. Fechner\u2019s law\nSensory systems make numerous adaptations, using a variety of mecha-\nnisms, to adjust to the average level of stimulus intensity. When a stimu-lus generates such adaptation, the relationship between stimulus and re-sponse is often studied in a potentially simpler regime by describing re-sponses to \ufb02uctuations about a mean stimulus level. In this case, s\n(t)is\nde\ufb01ned so that its time average over the duration of a trial is zero. We/integraltextT\n0dt s(t)/T=0\nfrequently assume that this condition,/integraltextT\n0dt s(t)/T=0.\nOur analysis of neural encoding involves two different types of averages:\naverages over repeated trials that employ the same stimulus, which wedenote by angle brackets, and averages over different stimuli. We couldintroduce a second notation for averages over stimuli, but this can beavoided when using time-dependent stimuli. Instead of presenting a num-ber of different stimuli and averaging over them, we can string together all stimulus and time\naverages of the stimuli we wish to consider into a single time-dependent stimulus\nsequence and average over time. Thus, stimulus averages are replaced bytime averages.\nAlthough a response recorded over a trial only depends on the values\ntaken by s\n(t)during that trial, some of the mathematical analyses presents\nin this chapter and in chapter 2 are simpli \ufb01ed if we de \ufb01ne the stimulus at\nother times as well. It is convenient if integrals involving the stimulus aretime-translationally invariant so that for any function hand time interval\n\u03c4\n/integraldisplayT\n0dt h(s(t+\u03c4))=/integraldisplayT+\u03c4\n\u03c4dt h(s(t))=/integraldisplayT\n0dt h(s(t)). (1.18)\nTo assure the last equality, we de \ufb01ne the stimulus outside the time limits periodic stimulus\nof the trial by the relation s(T+\u03c4)=s(\u03c4)for any \u03c4, thereby making the\nstimulus periodic.\nThe Spike-Triggered Average\nThe spike-triggered average stimulus, C(\u03c4), is the average value of the\nstimulus a time interval \u03c4before a spike is \ufb01red. In other words, for a\nspike occurring at time ti, we determine s(ti\u2212\u03c4), and then we sum over\nallnspikes in a trial, i=1,2,..., nand divide the total by n. In addition,\nwe average over trials. Thus, spike-triggered\naverage C (\u03c4)\nC(\u03c4)=/angbracketleftBigg\n1\nnn/summationdisplay\ni=1s(ti\u2212\u03c4)/angbracketrightBigg\n\u22481\n/angbracketleftn/angbracketright/angbracketleftBiggn/summationdisplay\ni=1s(ti\u2212\u03c4)/angbracketrightBigg\n. (1.19)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nThe approximate equality of the last expression follows from the fact that,\nifnis large, the total number of spikes on each trial is well approximated\nby the average number of spikes per trial, n\u2248/angbracketleftn/angbracketright. We make use of this ap-\nproximation because it allows us to relate the spike-triggered average toother quantities commonly used to characterize the relationship betweenstimulus and response (see below). Figure 1.8 provides a schematic de-scription of the computation of the spike-triggered average. Each timea spike appears, the stimulus in a time window preceding the spike isrecorded. Although the range of\n\u03c4values in equation 1.19 is unlimited, the\nresponse is typically affected only by the stimulus in a window a few hun-dred milliseconds wide immediately preceding a spike. More precisely,we expect C\n(\u03c4)to approach zero for positive \u03c4values larger than the cor-\nrelation time between the stimulus and the response. If the stimulus hasno temporal correlations with itself, we also expect for C\n(\u03c4)to be zero for\n\u03c4<0, because the response of a neuron cannot depend on future stimuli.\nIn practice, the stimulus is only recorded over a \ufb01nite time period as indi-\ncated by the shaded areas in \ufb01gure 1.8. The recorded stimuli for all spikes\nare then summed and the procedure is repeated over multiple trials.\ntime\nspike-triggered averages/AS\nFigure 1.8: Schematic of the procedure for computing the spike-triggered aver-\nage stimulus. Each grey rectangle contains the stimulus prior to one of the spikesshown along the time axis. These are averaged to produce the waveform shown atthe lower right, which is the average stimulus before a spike. The stimulus in thisexample is a piecewise constant function of time. (Adapted from Rieke et al. 1997.)\nThe spike-triggered average stimulus can be expressed as an integral of\nthe stimulus times the neural response function of equation 1.1. If we re-place the sum over spikes by an integral, as in equation 1.2, and use the\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(1.20)\nThe second equality is due to the equivalence of /angbracketleft\u03c1(t)/angbracketrightandr(t)within\nintegrals. Equation 1.20 allows us to relate the spike-triggered average tothe correlation function of the \ufb01ring rate and the stimulus.\nCorrelation functions are a useful way of determining how two quantities\nthat vary over time are related to each other. The two quantities beingrelated are evaluated at different times, one at time tand the other at time \ufb01ring-rate stimulus\ncorrelation function\nQ\nrst+\u03c4. The correlation function is then obtained by averaging their product\nover all tvalues, and it is a function of \u03c4. The correlation function of the\n\ufb01ring rate and the stimulus is\nQrs(\u03c4)=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dtr(t)s(t+\u03c4).

Because\nthe argument of the correlation function in equation 1.22 is \u2212\u03c4, the spike-\ntriggered average stimulus is often called the reverse correlation function. reverse correlation\nfunction It is proportional to the correlation of the \ufb01ring rate with the stimulus at\npreceding times.\nThe spike-triggered average stimulus is widely used to study and charac-\nterize neural responses. Because C(\u03c4)is the average value of the stimulus\na time \u03c4before a spike, larger values of \u03c4represent times further in the\npast relative to the time of the triggering spike. For this reason, we plotspike-triggered averages with the time axis going backward compared tothe normal convention. This allows the average spike-triggering stimulusto be read off from the plots in the usual left to right order.\nFigure 1.9 shows the spike-triggered average stimulus for a neuron in\nthe electrosensory lateral-line lobe of the weakly electric \ufb01shEigenmania .\nWeakly electric \ufb01sh generate oscillating electric \ufb01elds from an internal\nelectric organ.

The plot onthe right is the spike-triggered average stimulus. (Adapted from Gabbiani et al.,1996.)\nThe results obtained by spike-triggered averaging depend on the partic-\nular set of stimuli used during an experiment. How should this set bechosen? In chapter 2, we show that there are certain advantages to using astimulus that is uncorrelated from one time to the next, a white-noise stim-ulus. A heuristic argument supporting the use of such stimuli is that, inasking what makes a neuron \ufb01re, we may want to sample its responses\nto stimulus \ufb02uctuations at all frequencies with equal weight (i.e. equal\npower), and this is one of the properties of white noise stimuli. In prac-tice, white-noise stimuli can only be generated with equal power up to a\ufb01nite frequency cutoff, but neurons only respond to stimulus \ufb02uctuations\nwithin a limited frequency range anyway. Figure 1.9 is based on a such anapproximate white-noise stimulus. The power in a signal as a function ofits frequency is called the power spectrum or power spectral density, andwhite noise has a \ufb02at power spectrum.\nWhite-Noise Stimuli\nThe de \ufb01ning characteristic of a white-noise stimulus is that its value at\nany one time is uncorrelated with its value at any other time. This con-dition can be expressed using the stimulus-stimulus correlation function,also called the stimulus autocorrelation, which is de \ufb01ned by analogy with\nequation 1.21 as\nQ\nss(\u03c4)=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dt s(t)s(t+\u03c4).

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.3 What Makes a Neuron Fire? 21\ntime. For white-noise, the stimulus autocorrelation function is zero in the\nrange \u2212T/2<\u03c4< T/2 except when \u03c4=0, and over this range\nQss(\u03c4)=\u03c32\ns\u03b4(\u03c4). (1.24)\nThe constant \u03c3s, which has the units of the stimulus times the square root\nof the unit of time, determines the magnitude of the variability of thewhite-noise. In appendix A, we show that equation 1.24 is equivalent tothe statement that white-noise has equal power at all frequencies.\nNo physical system can generate noise that is white to arbitrarily high fre-\nquencies. Approximations of white-noise that are missing high-frequencycomponents can be used provided that the missing frequencies are wellabove the sensitivity of the neuron under investigation. To approximatewhite-noise, we consider times that are integer multiples of a basic unit ofduration\n/Delta1t, that is, times t=m/Delta1tform=1,2,..., Mwhere M/Delta1t=T.\nThe function s(t)is then constructed as a discrete sequence of stimulus\nvalues. This produces a step-like stimulus waveform, like the one thatappears in \ufb01gure 1.8, with a constant stimulus value s\nmpresented during\ntime bin m. In terms of the discrete-time values sm, the condition that the\nstimulus is uncorrelated is\n1\nMM/summationdisplay\nm=1smsm+p=/braceleftbigg\u03c32\ns//Delta1tifp=0\n0 otherwise .(1.25)\nT h ef a c t o ro f1 //Delta1ton the right side of this equation reproduces the \u03b4func-\ntion of equation 1.24 in the limit /Delta1t\u21920. For approximate white-noise,\nthe autocorrelation function is zero except for a region around \u03c4=0 with\nwidth of order /Delta1t. Similarly, the binning of time into discrete intervals of\nsize/Delta1tmeans that the noise generated only has a \ufb02at power spectrum up\nto frequencies of order 1 /(2/Delta1t).\nAn approximation to white-noise can be generated by choosing each sm\nindependently from a probability density with mean zero and variance\n\u03c32\ns//Delta1t. Any reasonable probability density function satisfying these two\nconditions can be used to generate the stimulus values within each timebin. A special class of white-noise stimuli, Gaussian white-noise, resultswhen the probability density used to generate the s\nmvalues is a Gaussian\nfunction. The factor of 1 //Delta1tin the variance indicates that the variabil-\nity must be increased as the time bins gets smaller. A number of otherschemes for ef \ufb01ciently generating approximately white-noise stimuli are\ndiscussed in the references at the end of this chapter.\nMultiple-Spike-Triggered Averages and Spike-Triggered\nCorrelations\nIn addition to triggering on single spikes, stimulus averages can be com-\nputed by triggering on various combinations of spikes.

These results come from a study of\nthe H1 movement-sensitive visual neuron of the blow \ufb02y. The H1 neuron\ndetects the motion of visual images during \ufb02ight to generate and guide sta-\nbilizing motor corrections. It responds to motion of the visual scene. In theexperiments, the \ufb02y is held \ufb01xed while a visual image with a time-varying\nvelocity s\n(t)is presented. Figure 1.10A, showing the spike-triggered aver-\nage stimulus, indicates that this neuron responds to positive angular ve-locities after alatency of about 15 ms. Figure 1.10B is the average stimu-lus prior to the appearance of two spikes separated by 10\n\u00b11 ms. This\ntwo-spike average is approximately equal to the sum of two single-spike-triggered average stimuli displaced from each other by 10 ms. Thus, for10 ms separations, two spikes occurring together tell us no more as a two-spike unit than they would individually. This result changes when shorterseparations are considered. Figure 1.10C shows the average stimulus trig-gered on two spikes separated by 5\n\u00b11 ms. The average stimulus trig-\ngered on a pair of spikes separated by 5 ms is not the same as the sum ofthe average stimuli for each spike separately.\nSpike-triggered averages of other stimulus-dependent quantities can pro-\nvide additional insight into neural encoding, for example spike-triggeredaverage autocorrelation functions. Obviously spike-triggered averages ofhigher-order stimulus combinations can be considered as well.\n1.4 Spike Train Statistics\nA complete description of the stochastic relationship between a stimulusand response would require us to know the probabilities corresponding toevery sequence of spikes that can be evoked by the stimulus. The prob-\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.4 Spike Train Statistics 23\nability of a spike sequence appearing is proportional to the probability\ndensity of spike times, p[t1,t2,..., tn]. In other words, the probability\nP[t1,t2,..., tn] that a sequence of nspikes occurs with spike ifalling be-\ntween times tiand ti+/Delta1tfori=1,2,..., nis given in terms of this density\nby the relation P[t1,t2,..., tn]=p[t1,t2,..., tn](/Delta1t)n.\nUnfortunately, the number of possible spike sequences is typically so large\nthat determining or even roughly estimating all of their probabilities ofoccurrence is impossible. Instead, we must rely on some statistical modelthat allows us to estimate the probability of an arbitrary spike sequenceoccurring, given our knowledge of the responses actually recorded. The\ufb01ring rate r\n(t)determines the probability of \ufb01ring a single spike in a small\ninterval around the time t,b u tr(t)is not, in general, suf \ufb01cient information\nto predict the probabilities of spike sequences. For example, the probabil-ity of two spike occurring together in a sequence is not necessarily equalto the product of the probabilities that they occur individually, becausethe presence of one spike may effect the occurrence of the other. If, how-ever, the probability of generating an action potential is independent ofthe presence or timing of other spikes, i.e. if the spikes are statistically in-dependent, the \ufb01ring rate is all that is needed to compute the probabilities\nfor all possible action potential sequences.\nA stochastic process that generates a sequence of events, such as action point process\npotentials, is called a point process. In general, the probability of an eventoccurring at any given time could depend on the entire history of preced-ing events. If this dependence extends only to the immediately precedingevent, so that the intervals between successive events are independent,the point process is called a renewal process. If there is no dependence renewal process\nat all on preceding events, so that the events themselves are statisticallyindependent, we have a Poisson process. The Poisson process providesan extremely useful approximation of stochastic neuronal \ufb01ring. To make Poisson proccess\nthe presentation easier to follow we separate two cases, the homogeneousPoisson process, for which the \ufb01ring rate is constant over time, and the\ninhomogeneous Poisson process, which involves a time-dependent \ufb01ring\nrate.\nThe Homogeneous Poisson Process\nWe denote the \ufb01ring rate for a homogeneous Poisson process by r(t)=r\nbecause it is independent of time. When the \ufb01ring rate is constant, the\nPoisson process generates every sequence of nspikes with equal probabil-\nity. As a result, the probability P[t1,t2,..., tn] can be expressed in terms\nof another probability function PT[n] which is the probability that any se-\nquence of nspikes occurs within a trial of duration T. Assuming that the\nspike times are ordered, so that 0 \u2264t1\u2264t2\u2264...\u2264tn\u2264T, the relationship\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n24 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nis\nP[t1,t2,..., tn]=n!PT[n]/parenleftbigg/Delta1t\nT/parenrightbiggn\n. (1.26)\nThis relationship is a special case of equation 1.37 derived below.\nTo compute PT[n], we divide the time Tinto Mbins of size /Delta1t=T/M.\nWe can assume that /Delta1tis small enough so that we never get two spikes\nwithin any one bin because, at the end of the calculation, we take the limit\n/Delta1t\u21920.PT[n] is the product of three factors: the probability of generat-\ningnspikes within a speci \ufb01ed set of the Mbins, the probability of not\ngenerating spikes in the remaining M\u2212nbins, and a combinatorial factor\nequal to the number of ways of putting nspikes into Mbins. The proba-\nbility of a spike occurring in one speci \ufb01c bin is r/Delta1t, and the probability of\nnspikes appearing in nspeci\ufb01c bins is (r/Delta1t)n. Similarly the probability of\nnot having a spike in a given bin is (1\u2212r/Delta1t), so the probability of having\nthe remaining M\u2212nbins without any spikes in them is (1\u2212r/Delta1t)M\u2212n.F i -\nnally, the number of ways of putting nspikes into Mbins is given by the\nbinomial coef \ufb01cient M!/(M\u2212n)!n!. Putting all these factors together we\n\ufb01nd,\nPT[n]=lim\n/Delta1t\u21920M!\n(M\u2212n)!n!(r/Delta1t)n(1\u2212r/Delta1t)M\u2212n. (1.27)\nTo take the limit we note that as /Delta1t\u21920,Mgrows without bound because\nM/Delta1t=T. Because nis\ufb01xed, we can write M\u2212n\u2248M=T//Delta1t.

For large M,\nM!/(M\u2212n)!\u2248Mn=(T//Delta1t)nso\nPT[n]=(rT)n\nn!exp(\u2212rT). (1.29)\nThis is called the Poisson distribution. The probabilities PT[n], for a few Poisson\ndistribution n values, are plotted as a function of rTin\ufb01gure 1.11A. Note that, as\nnincreases, the probability reaches its maximum at larger Tvalues and\nthat large nvalues are more likely than small ones for large T. Figure\n1.11B shows the probabilities of various numbers of spikes occurring whenthe average number of spikes is 10. For large rT, which corresponds to a\nlarge expected number of spikes, the Poisson distribution approaches aGaussian distribution with mean and variance equal to rT. Figure 1.11B\nshows that this approximation is already quite good for rT= 10.\nWe can compute the variance of spike counts produced by a Poisson pro-\ncess from the probabilities 1.29. For spikes counted over an interval ofduration T, the variance of the spike count (derived in appendix B) is\n\u03c32\nn=/angbracketleftn2/angbracketright\u2212/angbracketleft n/angbracketright2=rT.

The ratio of these\ntwo quantities, \u03c32\nn//angbracketleftn/angbracketright, is called the Fano factor and takes the value one for Fano factor\na homogeneous Poisson process, independent of the time interval T.\nThe probability density of time intervals between adjacent spikes is called\nthe interspike interval distribution, and it is a useful statistic for character- interspike interval\ndistribution izing spiking patterns. Suppose that a spike occurs at a time tifor some\nvalue of i. The probability of a homogeneous Poisson process generating\nthe next spike somewhere in the interval ti+\u03c4\u2264ti+1<ti+\u03c4+/Delta1t,f o r\nsmall /Delta1t, is the probability that no spike is \ufb01red for a time \u03c4, times the\nprobability, r/Delta1t, of generating a spike within the following small interval\n/Delta1t. From equation 1.29, with n=0, the probability of not \ufb01ring a spike\nfor period \u03c4is exp(\u2212r\u03c4), so the probability of an interspike interval falling\nbetween \u03c4and\u03c4+/Delta1tis\nP[\u03c4\u2264ti+1\u2212ti<\u03c4+/Delta1t]=r/Delta1texp(\u2212r\u03c4). (1.31)\nThe probability density of interspike intervals is, by de \ufb01nition, this prob-\nability with the factor /Delta1tremoved. Thus, the interspike interval distribu-\ntion for a homogeneous Poisson spike train is an exponential. The mostlikely interspike intervals are short ones, and long intervals have a proba-bility that falls exponentially as a function of their duration.\nFrom the interspike interval distribution of a homogeneous Poisson spike\ntrain, we can compute the mean interspike interval,\n/angbracketleft\u03c4/angbracketright=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4\u03c4rexp(\u2212r\u03c4)=1\nr, (1.32)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nand the variance of the interspike intervals,\n\u03c32\n\u03c4=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4\u03c42rexp(\u2212r\u03c4)\u2212/angbracketleft\u03c4/angbracketright2=1\nr2.

This is\na necessary, though not suf \ufb01cient, condition to identify a Poisson spike\ntrain. Recall that the Fano factor for a Poisson process is also one. Forany renewal process, the Fano factor evaluated over long time intervalsapproaches the value C\n2\nV.\nThe Spike-Train Autocorrelation Function\nThe spike interval distribution measures the distribution of times between\nsuccessive action potentials in a train. It is useful to generalize this con-cept and determine the distribution of times between any two spikes ina train. This is called the spike-train autocorrelation function, and it isparticularly useful for detecting patterns in spike trains, most notably os-cillations. The spike-train autocorrelation function is the autocorrelationof the neural response function of equation 1.1 with its average over timeand trials subtracted out. The time average of the neural response func-tion, from equation 1.6, is the spike-count rate r, and the trial average of spike-train\nautocorrelationfunction Q\n\u03c1\u03c1this quantity is /angbracketleftr/angbracketright=/angbracketleft n/angbracketright/T. Thus, the spike-train autocorrelation function\nis\nQ\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c4)=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dt/angbracketleft(\u03c1(t)\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright)(\u03c1(t+\u03c4)\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright)/angbracketright. (1.35)\nBecause the average is subtracted from the neural response function in this\nexpression, Q\u03c1\u03c1should really be called an autocovariance, not an autocor-\nrelation, but in practice it isn\u2019t.\nThe spike-train autocorrelation function is constructed from data in the\nform of a histogram by dividing time into bins. The value of the histogramfor a bin labeled by a positive or negative integer mis computed by deter-\nmining the number of the times that any two spikes in the train are sepa-rated by a time interval lying between\n(m\u22121/2)/Delta1tand(m+1/2)/Delta1twith\n/Delta1tthe bin size. This includes all pairings, even between a spike and it-\nself. We call this number Nm. If the intervals between the n2spike pairs in\nthe train were uniformly distributed over the range from zero to T, there\nwould be n2/Delta1t/Tintervals in each bin. This uniform term is removed\nfrom the autocorrelation histogram by subtracting n2/Delta1t/Tfrom Nmfor\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.4 Spike Train Statistics 27\nallm. The spike-train autocorrelation histogram is then de \ufb01ned by divid-\ning the resulting numbers by T, so the value of the histogram in bin mis\nHm=Nm/T\u2212n2/Delta1t/T2. For small bin sizes, the m=0 term in the his-\ntogram counts the average number of spikes, that is Nm=/angbracketleftn/angbracketrightand, in the\nlimit/Delta1t\u21920,H0=/angbracketleftn/angbracketright/Tis the average \ufb01ring rate /angbracketleftr/angbracketright. Because other bins\nhave Hmof order /Delta1t, the large m=0 term is often removed from histogram\nplots. The spike-train autocorrelation function is de \ufb01ned as Hm//Delta1tin the\nlimit/Delta1t\u21920, and it has the units of a \ufb01ring rate squared. In this limit, the\nm=0 bin becomes a \u03b4function, H0//Delta1t\u2192/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u03b4(\u03c4).\nAs we have seen, the distribution of interspike intervals for adjacent spikes\nin a homogeneous Poisson spike train is exponential (equation 1.31). Bycontrast, the intervals between any two spikes (not necessarily adjacent)in such a train are uniformly distributed. As a result, the subtraction pro-cedure outlined above gives H\nm=0 for all bins except for the m=0 bin that\ncontains the contribution of the zero intervals between spikes and them-selves.

(1.37)\nThis result applies if the spike times have been written in temporal order.\nIf the spike times are not ordered, so that, for example, we are interestedin the probability density for any spike occurring at the time t\n1, not neces-\nsarily the \ufb01rst spike, these expression should be divided by a factor of n!\nto account for the number of different possible orderings of spike times.\nThe Poisson Spike Generator\nSpike sequences can be simulated by using some estimate of the \ufb01ring\nrate,rest(t), predicted from knowledge of the stimulus, to drive a Poisson\nprocess. A simple procedure for generating spikes in a computer programis based on the fact that the estimated probability of \ufb01ring a spike dur-\ning a short interval of duration\n/Delta1tisrest(t)/Delta1t. The program progresses\nthrough time in small steps of size /Delta1tand generates, at each time step,\na random number xrandchosen uniformly in the range between zero and\none.

If xrandis uniformly distributed over\nthe range between zero and one, the negative of its logarithm is exponen-tially distributed. Thus, we can generate spike times iteratively from theformula t\ni+1=ti\u2212ln(xrand)/r. Unlike, the algorithm discussed in the pre-\nvious paragraph, this method only works for constant \ufb01ring rates. How-\never, it can be extended to time-dependent rates by using a procedure\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Models that allow for\na dependence of \ufb01ring rate on stimulus history are discussed in chapter\n2. In \ufb01gure 1.13, the orientation angle increases in a sequence of steps.\nThe\ufb01ring rate follows these changes, and the Poisson process generates\nan irregular \ufb01ring pattern that re \ufb02ects the underlying rate but varies from\ntrial to trial.\nCertain features of neuronal \ufb01ring violate the independence assumption\nthat forms the basis of the Poisson model, at least if a constant \ufb01ring rate\nis used. We have already noted that there are periods of time, the abso-lute and relative refractory periods, following the generation of an actionpotential when the probability of a spike occurring is greatly or somewhatreduced. Refractory effects can be incorporated into a Poisson model ofspike generation by setting the \ufb01ring rate to zero immediately after a spike\nis\ufb01red, and then letting it return to its predicted value according to some\ndynamic rule such as an exponential recovery.\nComparison with Data\nThe Poisson process is simple and useful, but does it match data on neuralresponse variability?

The values of both Aand Btypically lie between 1.0 and\n1.5. Because the Poisson model predicts A=B=1, this indicates that the\ndata show a higher degree of variability than the Poisson model wouldpredict. However, many of these experiments involve anesthetized ani-mals, and it is known that response variability is higher in anesthetizedthan in alert animals. Figure 1.14 shows their data for spike-count meansand variances extracted from recordings of MT neurons in alert macaquemonkeys using a number of different stimuli. The MT (medial temporal)area is a visual region of the primate cortex where many neurons are sen- area MT\nsitive to image motion. The individual means and variances are scatteredin\ufb01gure 1.14A, but they cluster around the diagonal which is the Poisson\nprediction. Similarly, the results show Aand Bvalues close to one, the\nPoisson values ( \ufb01gure 1.14B). Of course, many neural responses cannot be\ndescribed by Poisson statistics, but it is reassuring to see a case where thePoisson model seems a reasonable approximation.\nInterspike interval distributions are extracted from data as interspike in-\nterval histograms by counting the number of intervals falling in discretetime bins. Figure 1.15A presents an example, from the responses of a non-bursting cell in area MT of a monkey in response to images consisting ofrandomly moving dots with a variable amount of coherence imposed ontheir motion (see chapter 3 for a more detailed description). For interspikeintervals longer than about 10 ms, the shape of this histogram is expo-nential, in agreement with equation 1.31. However, for shorter intervalsthere is a discrepancy. While the homogeneous Poisson distribution 1.31rises for short interspike intervals, the experimental results show a rapiddecrease. This is the result of refractoriness making short interspike inter-vals less likely than the Poisson model would predict. Data on interspike gamma\ndistribution intervals can be \ufb01t more accurately by a gamma distribution,\np[\n\u03c4]=r(r\u03c4)kexp(\u2212r\u03c4)\nk!(1.39)\nwith k>0 than by the exponential distribution of the Poisson model,\nwhich has k=0.\nFigure 1.15B shows a theoretical histogram obtained by adding a refrac-\ntory period of a variable duration to the Poisson model. Spiking was pro-hibited during the refractory period, and then was described once againby a homogeneous Poisson process. The refractory period was randomlychosen from a Gaussian distribution with a mean of 5 ms and a standarddeviation of 2 ms (only random draws that generated positive refractoryperiods were included). The resulting interspike interval distribution of\ufb01gure 1.15B agrees quite well with the data.\nC\nVvalues extracted from the spike trains of neurons recorded in monkeys\nfrom area MT and primary visual cortex (V1) are shown in \ufb01gure 1.16.

However, there are cases when the accuracy in the timing andnumbers of spikes \ufb01red by a neuron is considerably higher than would\nbe implied by Poisson statistics. Furthermore, even when it successfullydescribes data, the Poisson model does not provide a mechanistic explana-tion of neuronal response variability. Spike generation, by itself, is highlyreliable in real neurons.

We explore ideas about possible sources of spike-train variability inchapter 5.\nSome neurons \ufb01re action potentials in clusters or bursts of spikes that can-\nnot be described by a Poisson process with a \ufb01xed rate. Bursting can be\nincluded in a Poisson model by allowing the \ufb01ring rate to \ufb02uctuate to de-\nscribe the high rate of \ufb01ring during a burst. Sometimes the distribution of\nbursts themselves can be described by a Poisson process (such a doublystochastic process is called a Cox process).\n1.5 The Neural Code\nThe nature of the neural code is a topic of intense debate within the neuro-science community. Much of the discussion has focused on whether neu-rons use rate coding or temporal coding, often without a clear de \ufb01nition\nof what these terms mean. We feel that the central issue in neural coding iswhether individual action potentials and individual neurons encode inde-pendently of each other, or whether correlations between different spikesand different neurons carry signi \ufb01cant amounts of information. We there-\nfore contrast independent-spike and independent-neuron codes with cor-relation codes before addressing the issue of temporal coding.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nIndependent-Spike, Independent-Neuron, and Correlation\nCodes\nThe neural response, and its relation to the stimulus, is completely char-\nacterized by the probability distribution of spike times as a function ofthe stimulus. If spike generation can be described as an inhomogeneousPoisson process, this probability distribution can be computed from thetime-dependent \ufb01ring rate r\n(t)using equation 1.37. In this case, r(t)con-\ntains all the information about the stimulus that can be extracted from thespike train, and the neural code could reasonably be called a rate code.Unfortunately, this de \ufb01nition does not agree with common usage. In-\nstead, we will call a code based solely on the time-dependent \ufb01ring rate independent-spike\ncode an independent-spike code. This refers to the fact that the generation of\neach spike is independent of all the other spikes in the train. If individ-ual spikes do not encode independently of each other, we call the code acorrelation code, because correlations between spike times may carry ad- correlation code\nditional information. In reality, information is likely to be carried both byindividual spikes and through correlations, and some arbitrary dividingline must be established to characterize the code. Identifying a correlationcode should require that a signi \ufb01cant amount of information be carried by\ncorrelations, say as much as is carried by the individual spikes.\nA simple example of a correlation code would be if signi \ufb01cant amounts\nof information about a stimulus were carried by interspike intervals. Inthis case, if we considered spike times individually, independently of eachother, we would miss the information carried by the intervals betweenthem. This is just one example of a correlation code. Information could becarried by more complex relationships between spikes.\nIndependent-spike codes are much simpler to analyze than correlation\ncodes, and most work on neural coding assumes spike independence.When careful studies have been done, it has been found that some in-formation is carried by correlations between two or more spikes, but thisinformation is rarely larger than 10% of the information carried by spikesconsidered independently. Of course, it is possible that, due to our igno-rance of the \u2018real\u2019 neural code, we have not yet uncovered or examined thetypes of correlations that are most signi \ufb01cant for neural coding. Although\nthis is not impossible, we view it as unlikely and feel that the evidence forindependent-spike coding, at least as a fairly accurate approximation, isquite convincing.\nThe discussion to this point has focused on information carried by single\nneurons, but information is typically encoded by neuronal populations.When we study population coding, we must consider whether individ-ual neurons act independently, or whether correlations between differentneurons carry additional information. The analysis of population codingis easiest if the response of each neuron is considered statistically inde-pendent, and such independent-neuron coding is typically assumed in independent-\nneuroncodethe analysis of population codes (chapter 3). The independent-neuron\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.5 The Neural Code 35\nhypothesis does not mean that the spike trains of different neurons are\nnot combined into an ensemble code. Rather it means that they can becombined without taking correlations into account. To test the validity ofthis assumption, we must ask whether correlations between the spikingof different neurons provide additional information about a stimulus thatcannot be obtained by considering all of their \ufb01ring patterns individually.\nSynchronous \ufb01ring of two or more neurons is one mechanism for convey- synchrony and\noscillations ing information in a population correlation code. Rhythmic oscillations\nof population activity provides another possible mechanism, as discussedbelow. Both synchronous \ufb01ring and oscillations are common features of\nthe activity of neuronal populations. However, the existence of these fea-tures is not suf \ufb01cient for establishing a correlation code, because it is es-\nsential to show that a signi \ufb01cant amount of information is carried by the\nresulting correlations. The assumption of independent-neuron coding is auseful simpli \ufb01cation that is not in gross contradiction with experimental\ndata, but it is less well established and more likely to be challenged in thefuture than the independent-spike hypothesis.\n1.41.31.21.1\nposition (m)20\n00180360spikes phase (degrees)\nFigure 1.18: Position versus phase for a hippocampal place cell. Each dot in the\nupper \ufb01gure shows the phase of the theta rhythm plotted against the position of\nthe animal at the time when a spike was \ufb01red. The linear relation shows that infor-\nmation about position is contained in the relative phase of \ufb01ring. The lower plot is\na conventional place \ufb01eld tuning curve of spike count versus position. (Adapted\nfrom O\u2019Keefe and Recce, 1993.)\nPlace cell coding of spatial location in the rat hippocampus is an example\nwhere at least some additional information appears to be carried by cor- hippocampal\nplace cells relations between the \ufb01ring patterns of neurons in a population. The hip-\npocampus is a structure located deep inside the temporal lobe that plays\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n36 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\nan important role in memory formation and is involved in a variety of spa-\ntial tasks. The \ufb01ring rates of many hippocampal neurons, recorded when\na rat is moving around a familiar environment, depend on the location ofthe animal, and are restricted to spatially localized areas called the place\ufb01elds of the cells. In addition, when a rat explores an environment, hip-\npocampal neurons \ufb01re collectively in a rhythmic pattern with a frequency\nin the theta range, 7-12 Hz. The spiking time of an individual place cellrelative to the phase of the population theta rhythm actually gives addi-tional information about the location of the rat not provided by place cellsconsidered individually. The relationship between location and phase ofplace cell \ufb01ring shown in \ufb01gure 1.18 means, for example, that we can dis-\ntinguish two locations on opposite sides of the peak of a single neuron\u2019stuning curve that correspond to the same \ufb01ring rate, by knowing when\nthe spikes occurred relative to the theta rhythm. However, the amount ofadditional information carried by correlations between place \ufb01eld\ufb01ring\nand the theta rhythm has not been fully quanti \ufb01ed.\nTemporal Codes\nThe concept of temporal coding arises when we consider how precisely\nwe must measure spike times to extract most of the information from aneuronal response. This precision determines the temporal resolution ofthe neural code. A number of studies have found that this temporal res-olution is on a millisecond time scale, indicating that precise spike timingis a signi \ufb01cant element in neural encoding. Similarly, we can ask whether\nhigh-frequency \ufb01ring-rate \ufb02uctuations carry signi \ufb01cant information about\na stimulus. When precise spike timing or high-frequency \ufb01ring-rate \ufb02uc-\ntuations are found to carry information, the neural code is often identi \ufb01ed\nas a temporal code.\nThe temporal structure of a spike train or \ufb01ring rate evoked by a stimulus\nis determined both by the dynamics of the stimulus and by the nature ofthe neural encoding process. Stimuli that change rapidly tend to generateprecisely timed spikes and rapidly changing \ufb01ring rates no matter what\nneural coding strategy is being used. Temporal coding refers to (or shouldrefer to) temporal precision in the response that does not arise solely fromthe dynamics of the stimulus, but that nevertheless relates to propertiesof the stimulus. The interplay between stimulus and encoding dynamicsmakes the identi \ufb01cation of a temporal code dif \ufb01cult.\nThe issue of temporal coding is distinct and independent from the issue of\nindependent-spike coding discussed above. If the independent-spike hy-pothesis is valid, the temporal character of the neural code is determinedby the behavior of r\n(t).I fr(t)varies slowly with time, the code is typically\ncalled a rate code, and if it varies rapidly, the code is called temporal. Fig-ure 1.19 provides an example of different \ufb01ring-rate behaviors for a neuron\nin area MT of a monkey recorded over multiple trials with three different\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n1.5 The Neural Code 37\nstimuli (consisting of moving random dots). The activity in the top panel\nwould typically be regarded as re \ufb02ecting rate coding, and the activity in\nthe bottom panel as re \ufb02ecting temporal coding. However, the identi \ufb01ca-\ntion of rate and temporal coding in this way is ambiguous because it is notobvious what criterion should be used to characterize the changes in r\n(t)\nas slow or rapid.\n2000 1500 1000 500 0\ntime (ms)140spikes/ s\nFigure 1.19: Time-dependent \ufb01ring rates for different stimulus parameters. The\nrasters show multiple trials during which an MT neuron responded to the samemoving random dot stimulus. Firing rates, shown above the raster plots, wereconstructed from the multiple trials by counting spikes within discrete time binsand averaging over trials. The three different results are from the same neuron butusing different stimuli. The stimuli were always patterns of moving random dotsbut the coherence of the motion was varied (see chapter 3 for more informationabout this stimulus). (Adapted from Bair and Koch, 1996.)\nOne possibility is to use the spikes to distinguish slow from rapid, so that\na temporal code is identi \ufb01ed when peaks in the \ufb01ring rate occur with\nroughly the same frequency as the spikes themselves. In this case, eachpeak corresponds to the \ufb01ring of only one, or at most a few action po-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n38 Neural Encoding I: Firing Rates and Spike Statistics\ntentials. While this de \ufb01nition makes intuitive sense, it is problematic to\nextend it to the case of population coding. When many neurons are in-volved, any single neuron may \ufb01re only a few spikes before its \ufb01ring rate\nchanges, but collectively the population may produce a large number ofspikes over the same time period. Thus, a neuron that appears to employa temporal code, by this de \ufb01nition, may be part of a population that does\nnot.\nAnother proposal is to use the stimulus, rather than the response, to estab-\nlish what makes a temporal code. In this case, a temporal code is de \ufb01ned\nas one in which information is carried by details of spike timing on a scaleshorter than the fastest time characterizing variations of the stimulus. Thisrequires that information about the stimulus be carried by Fourier com-ponents of r\n(t)at frequencies higher than those present in the stimulus.\nMany of the cases where a temporal code has been reported using spikesto de\ufb01ne the nature of the code would be called rate codes if the stimulus\nwere used instead.\nThe debate between rate and temporal coding dominates discussions\nabout the nature of the neural code. Determining the temporal resolutionof the neural code is clearly important, but much of this debate seems un-informative. We feel that the central challenge is to identify relationshipsbetween the \ufb01ring patterns of different neurons in a responding popula-\ntion and to understand their signi \ufb01cance for neural coding.\n1.6 Chapter Summary\nWith this chapter, we have begun our study of the way that neurons en-\ncode information using spikes. We used a sequence of \u03b4functions, the neu-\nral response function, to represent a spike train and de \ufb01ned three types of\n\ufb01ring rates: the single-spike probability density r(t), the spike-count rate r\nand the average \ufb01ring rate /angbracketleftr/angbracketright. In the discussion of how the \ufb01ring rate r(t)\ncould be extracted from data, we introduced the important concepts of a\nlinear \ufb01lter and a kernel acting as a sliding window function. The average\n\ufb01ring rate expressed as a function of a static stimulus parameter is called\nthe response tuning curve, and we presented examples of Gaussian, co-sine and sigmoidal tuning curves. Spike-triggered averages of stimuli, orreverse correlation functions, were introduced to characterize the selectiv-ity of neurons to dynamic stimuli. The homogeneous and inhomogeneousPoisson processes were presented as models of stochastic spike sequences.We de \ufb01ned correlation functions, auto- and cross-correlations, and power\nspectra, and used the Fano factor, interspike-interval histogram, and co-ef\ufb01cient of variation to characterize the stochastic properties of spiking.\nWe concluded with a discussion of independent-spike and independent-neuron codes versus correlation codes, and of the temporal precision ofspike timing as addressed in discussion of temporal coding.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

We begin by computing the probability that nospikes are generated during the time interval from t\nitoti+1between two\nadjacent spikes. We determine this by dividing the interval into Mbins of\nsize/Delta1tassuming that M/Delta1t=ti+1\u2212ti. We will ultimately take the limit\n/Delta1t\u21920. The \ufb01ring rate during bin mwithin this interval is r(ti+m/Delta1t).\nBecause the probability of \ufb01ring a spike in this bin is r(ti+m/Delta1t)/Delta1t,t h e\nprobability of not \ufb01ring a spike is 1 \u2212r(ti+m/Delta1t)/Delta1t.

(1.52)\nWe evaluate this expression by taking its logarithm,\nlnP[no spikes] =M/summationdisplay\nm=1ln(1\u2212r(ti+m/Delta1t)/Delta1t), (1.53)\nusing the fact that the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms\nof the multiplied terms.

In this chapter,we show how spike-triggered averages and reverse-correlation techniquescan be used to construct estimates of \ufb01ring rates evoked by arbitrary\ntime-dependent stimuli. Firing rates calculated directly from reverse-correlation functions provide only a linear estimate of the response of aneuron, but we also present in this chapter various methods for includingnonlinear effects such as \ufb01ring thresholds.\nSpike-triggered averages and reverse-correlation techniques have been retina\nLGN\nV1, area 17used extensively to study properties of visually responsive neurons in the\nretina (retinal ganglion cells), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and pri-mary visual cortex (V1, or area 17 in the cat). At these early stages ofvisual processing, the responses of some neurons (simple cells in primaryvisual cortex, for example) can be described quite accurately using thisapproach. Other neurons (complex cells in primary visual cortex, for ex-ample) can be described by extending the formalism. Reverse-correlationtechniques have also been applied to responses of neurons in visual areasV2, area 18, and MT, but they generally fail to capture the more complexand nonlinear features typical of responses at later stages of the visualsystem. Descriptions of visual responses based on reverse correlation areapproximate, and they do not explain how visual responses arise fromthe synaptic, cellular, and network properties of retinal, LGN, and corticalcircuits. Nevertheless, they provide a important framework for character-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nizing response selectivities, a reference point for identifying and charac-\nterizing novel effects, and a basis for building mechanistic models, someof which are discussed at the end of this chapter and in chapter 7.\n2.2 Estimating Firing Rates\nIn chapter 1, we discussed a simple model in which \ufb01ring rates were esti-\nmated as instantaneous functions of the stimulus, using response tuningcurves. The activity of a neuron at time ttypically depends on the be-\nhavior of the stimulus over a period of time starting a few hundred mil-liseconds prior to tand ending perhaps tens of milliseconds before t. Re-\nverse correlation methods can be used to construct a more accurate modelthat includes the effects of the stimulus over such an extended period oftime. The basic problem is to construct an estimate r\nest(t)of the \ufb01ring rate\nr(t)evoked by a stimulus s(t). The simplest way to construct an estimate\nis to assume that the \ufb01ring rate at any given time can be expressed as a\nweighted sum of the values taken by the stimulus at earlier times. Sincetime is a continuous variable this \u2018sum\u2019 actually takes the form of an inte- \ufb01ring rate\nestimate r\nest(t) gral, and we write\nrest(t)=r0+/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4D(\u03c4)s(t\u2212\u03c4). (2.1)\nThe term r0accounts for any background \ufb01ring that may occur when s=0.\nD(\u03c4)is a weighting factor that determines how strongly, and with what\nsign, the value of the stimulus at time t\u2212\u03c4affects the \ufb01ring rate at time t.\nNote that the integral in equation 2.1 is a linear \ufb01lter of the same form as\nthe expressions used to compute rapprox(t)in chapter 1.\nAs discussed in chapter 1, sensory systems tend to adapt to the absolute\nintensity of a stimulus. It is easier to account for the responses to \ufb02uctu-\nations of a stimulus around some mean background level than it is is toaccount for adaptation processes. We therefore assume throughout thischapter that the stimulus parameter s\n(t)has been de \ufb01ned with its mean\nvalue subtracted out. This means that the time integral of s(t)over the\nduration of a trial is zero.\nWe have provided a heuristic justi \ufb01cation for the terms in equation 2.1\nbut, more formally, they correspond to the \ufb01rst two terms in a systematic\nexpansion of the response in powers of the stimulus. Such an expansionis the functional equivalent of the Taylor series expansion used to gener-ate power series approximations of functions, and it is called the Volterraexpansion. For the case we are considering, it takes the form Volterra expansion\nr\nest(t)=r0+/integraldisplay\nd\u03c4D(\u03c4)s(t\u2212\u03c4)+/integraldisplay\nd\u03c41d\u03c42D2(\u03c41,\u03c42)s(t\u2212\u03c41)s(t\u2212\u03c42)+\n/integraldisplay\nd\u03c41d\u03c42d\u03c43D3(\u03c41,\u03c42,\u03c43)s(t\u2212\u03c41)s(t\u2212\u03c42)s(t\u2212\u03c43)+.... (2.2)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n2.2 Estimating Firing Rates 3\nThis series was rearranged by Wiener to make the terms easier to compute.\nThe\ufb01rst two terms of the Volterra and Wiener expansions are identical Wiener expansion\nand are given by the two expressions on the right side of equation 2.1. Forthis reason, Dis called the \ufb01rst Wiener kernel, the linear kernel, or, when Wiener kernel\nhigher-order terms (terms involving more than one factor of the stimulus)are not being considered, simply the kernel.\nTo construct an estimate of the \ufb01ring rate based on an expression of the\nform 2.1, we choose the kernel Dto minimize the squared difference be-\ntween the estimated response to a stimulus and the actual measured re-sponse averaged over time,\nE\n=1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dt(rest(t)\u2212r(t))2. (2.3)\nThis expression can be minimized by setting its derivative with respect\nto the function Dto zero (see appendix A). The result is that Dsatis\ufb01es\nan equation involving two quantities introduced in chapter 1, the \ufb01ring\nrate-stimulus correlation function, Qrs(\u03c4)=/integraltext\ndtr(t)s(t+\u03c4)/T, and the\nstimulus autocorrelation function, Qss(\u03c4)=/integraltext\ndt s(t)s(t+\u03c4)/T, optimal kernel\n/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4/primeQss(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4/prime)D(\u03c4/prime)=Qrs(\u2212\u03c4). (2.4)\nThe method we are describing is called reverse correlation because the \ufb01r-\ning rate\u2013stimulus correlation function is evaluated at \u2212\u03c4in this equation.\nEquation 2.4 can be solved most easily if the stimulus is white noise, al-\nthough it can be solved in the general case as well (see appendix A). Fora white-noise stimulus Q\nss(\u03c4)=\u03c32\ns\u03b4(\u03c4) (see chapter 1), so the left side of\nequation 2.4 is\n\u03c32\ns/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4/prime\u03b4(\u03c4\u2212\u03c4/prime)D(\u03c4/prime)=\u03c32\nsD(\u03c4). (2.5)\nAs a result, the kernel that provides the best linear estimate of the \ufb01ring\nrate is white-noise kernel\nD(\u03c4)=Qrs(\u2212\u03c4)\n\u03c32s=/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightC(\u03c4)\n\u03c32s(2.6)\nwhere C(\u03c4)is the spike-triggered average stimulus, and /angbracketleftr/angbracketrightis the aver-\nage\ufb01ring rate of the neuron. For the second equality, we have used the\nrelation Qrs(\u2212\u03c4)=/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightC(\u03c4)from chapter 1. Based on this result, the stan-\ndard method used to determine the optimal kernel is to measure the spike-triggered average stimulus in response to a white-noise stimulus.\nI nc h a p t e r1 ,w ei n t r o d u c et h eH 1n e u r o no ft h e \ufb02y visual system, which\nresponds to moving images.

The agreement is good in regions wherethe measured rate varies slowly but the estimate fails to capture high-frequency \ufb02uctuations of the \ufb01ring rate, presumably because of nonlin-\near effects not captured by the linear kernel.

(Adapted from Rieke et al.,\n1997.)\nThe Most Effective Stimulus\nNeuronal selectivity is often characterized by describing stimuli that evoke\nmaximal responses. The reverse-correlation approach provides a justi \ufb01ca-\ntion for this procedure by relating the optimal kernel for \ufb01ring rate estima-\ntion to the stimulus predicted to evoke the maximum \ufb01ring rate, subject\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n2.2 Estimating Firing Rates 5\nto a constraint. A constraint is essential because the linear estimate 2.1 is\nunbounded. The constraint we use is that the time integral of the square ofthe stimulus over the duration of the trial is held \ufb01xed. We call this integral\nthe stimulus energy. The stimulus for which equation 2.1 predicts the max-imum response at some \ufb01xed time subject to this constraint, is computed\nin appendix B. The result is that the stimulus producing the maximum re-sponse is proportional to the optimal linear kernel, or equivalently to thewhite-noise spike-triggered average stimulus. This is an important resultbecause in cases where a white-noise analysis has not been done, we maystill have some idea what stimulus produces the maximum response.\nThe maximum stimulus analysis provides an intuitive interpretation of\nthe linear estimate of equation 2.1. At \ufb01xed stimulus energy, the integral\nin 2.1 measures the overlap between the actual stimulus and the most ef-fective stimulus. In other words, it indicates how well the actual stimulusmatches the most effective stimulus. Mismatches between these two re-duce the value of the integral and result in lower predictions for the \ufb01ring\nrate.\nStatic Nonlinearities\nThe optimal kernel produces an estimate of the \ufb01ring rate that is a linear\nfunction of the stimulus. Neurons and nervous systems are nonlinear, soa linear estimate is only an approximation, albeit a useful one. The lin-ear prediction has two obvious problems: there is nothing to prevent thepredicted \ufb01ring rate from becoming negative, and the predicted rate does\nnot saturate, but instead increases without bound as the magnitude of thestimulus increases. One way to deal with these and some of the other de-\ufb01ciencies of a linear prediction is to write the \ufb01ring rate as a background\nrate plus a nonlinear function of the linearly \ufb01ltered stimulus. We use Lto\nrepresent the linear term we have been discussing thus far,\nL\n(t)=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4D(\u03c4)s(t\u2212\u03c4). (2.7)\nThe modi \ufb01cation is to replace the linear prediction rest(t)=r0+L(t)by the rest(t)with static\nnonlinearity generalization\nrest(t)=r0+F(L(t)) (2.8)\nwhere Fis an arbitrary function. Fis called a static nonlinearity to stress\nthat it is a function of the linear \ufb01lter value evaluated instantaneously at\nthe time of the rate estimation. If Fis appropriately bounded from above\nand below, the estimated \ufb01ring rate will never be negative or unrealisti-\ncally large.\nFcan be extracted from data by means of the graphical procedure illus-\ntrated in \ufb01gure 2.2A. First, a linear estimate of the \ufb01ring rate is computed\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nusing the optimal kernel de \ufb01ned by equation 2.4. Next a plot is made\nof the pairs of points (L(t),r(t))at various times and for various stimuli,\nwhere r(t)is the actual rate extracted from the data. There will be a certain\namount of scatter in this plot due to the inaccuracy of the estimation. Ifthe scatter is not too large, however, the points should fall along a curve,and this curve is a plot of the function F\n(L).

B) Different static nonlinearities used in estimating\nneural responses. Lis dimensionless, and equations 2.9, 2.10, and 2.10 have been\nused with G=25 Hz, L0=1,L1/2=3,rmax=100 Hz, g1=2, and g2=1/2.\ntains constants used to set the \ufb01ring rate to realistic values. These give us\nthe freedom to normalize D(\u03c4)in some convenient way, correcting for the\narbitrary normalization by adjusting the parameters within F.\nStatic nonlinearities are used to introduce both \ufb01ring thresholds and satu-\nration into estimates of neural responses. Thresholds can be described by threshold function\nwriting\nF(L)=G[L\u2212L0]+ (2.9)\nwhere L0is the threshold value that Lmust attain before \ufb01ring begins.\nAbove the threshold, the \ufb01ring rate is a linear function of L,w i t h Gacting\nas the constant of proportionality. Half-wave recti \ufb01cation is a special case recti\ufb01cation\nof this with L0=0. That this function does not saturate is not a problem if\nlarge stimulus values are avoided. If needed, a saturating nonlinearity canbe included in F, and a sigmoidal function is often used for this purpose, sigmoid function\nF\n(L)=rmax\n1+exp/parenleftbig\ng1(L1/2\u2212L)/parenrightbig. (2.10)\nHere rmaxis the maximum possible \ufb01ring rate, L1/2is the value of Lfor\nwhich Fachieves half of this maximal value, and g1determines how\nrapidly the \ufb01ring rate increases as a function of L. Another choice that\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n2.2 Estimating Firing Rates 7\ncombines a hard threshold with saturation uses a recti \ufb01ed hyperbolic tan-\ngent function,\nF(L)=rmax[tanh/parenleftbig\ng2(L\u2212L0)/parenrightbig\n]+ (2.11)\nwhere rmaxand g2play similar roles as in equation 2.10, and L0is the\nthreshold. Figure 2.2B shows the different nonlinear functions that wehave discussed.\nAlthough the static nonlinearity can be any function, the estimate of equa-\ntion 2.8 is still restrictive because it allows for no dependence on weightedautocorrelations of the stimulus or other higher-order terms in the Volterraseries. Furthermore, once the static nonlinearity is introduced, the linearkernel derived from equation 2.4 is no longer optimal because it was cho-sen to minimize the squared error of the linear estimate r\nest(t)=L(t),n o t\nthe estimate with the static nonlinearity rest(t)=F(L(t)). A theorem due\nto Bussgang (see appendix C) suggests that equation 2.6 will provide areasonable kernel, even in the presence of a static nonlinearity, if the whitenoise stimulus used is Gaussian.\nIn some cases, the linear term of the Volterra series fails to predict the re-\nsponse even when static nonlinearities are included. Systematic improve-ments can be attempted by including more terms in the Volterra or Wienerseries, but in practice it is quite dif \ufb01cult to go beyond the \ufb01rst few terms.\nThe accuracy with which the \ufb01rst term, or \ufb01rst few terms, in a Volterra\nseries can predict the responses of a neuron can sometimes be improvedby replacing the parameter sin equation 2.7 by an appropriately chosen\nfunction of s, so that\nL\n(t)=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4D(\u03c4)f(s(t\u2212\u03c4)). (2.12)\nA reasonable choice for this function is the response tuning curve. With\nthis choice, the linear prediction is equal to the response tuning curve,\nL=f(s), for static stimuli provided that the integral of the kernel Dis\nequal to one.

In the\n\ufb01gure, spikes are shown being generated by comparing the spiking prob-\nability r\n(t)/Delta1tto a random number, although the other methods discussed\nin chapter 1 could be used instead.

The conversion of a light stimulus intoan electrical signal and ultimately an action potential sequence occurs inthe retina. Figure 2.4A is an anatomical diagram showing the \ufb01ve prin-\ncipal cell types of the retina, and \ufb01gure 2.4B is a rough circuit diagram.\nIn the retina, light is \ufb01rst converted into an electrical signal by a photo-\ntransduction cascade within rod and cone photoreceptor cells. Figure 2.4Bshows intracellular recordings made in neurons of the retina of a mud-puppy (an amphibian). The stimulus used for these recordings was a \ufb02ash\nof light falling primarily in the region of the photoreceptor at the left of\ufb01gure 2.4B. The rod cells, especially the one on the left side of \ufb01gure 2.4B,\nare hyperpolarized by the light \ufb02ash. This electrical signal is passed along\nto bipolar and horizontal cells through synaptic connections. Note that inone of the bipolar cells, the signal has been inverted leading to depolar-ization. These smoothly changing membrane potentials provide a gradedrepresentation of the light intensity during the \ufb02ash. This form of cod-\ning is adequate for signaling within the retina, where distances are small.However, it is inadequate for the task of conveying information from theretina to the brain.\nThe output neurons of the retina are the retinal ganglion cells whose axons retinal ganglion\ncells form the optic nerve. As seen in \ufb01gure 2.4B, the subthreshold potentials\nof the two retinal ganglion cells shown are similar to those of the bipolarcells immediately above them in the \ufb01gure, but now with superimposed\naction potentials. The two retinal ganglion cells shown in the \ufb01gure have\ndifferent responses and transmit different sequences of action potentials.G\n2\ufb01res while the light is on, and G 1\ufb01res when it turns off. These are called ON and OFF\nresponses ON and OFF responses, respectively. The optic nerve conducts the output\nspike trains of retinal ganglion cells to the lateral geniculate nucleus of thethalamus, which acts as a relay station between the retina and primaryvisual cortex ( \ufb01gure 2.5). Prior to arriving at the LGN, some retinal gan-\nglion cell axons cross the midline at the optic chiasm. This allow the leftand right sides of the visual \ufb01elds from both eyes to be represented on the\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

We do not consider such ef-\nfects, although they are a current focus of experimental and theoretical in-terest. In the monkey, cortical receptive \ufb01elds range in size from around a\ntenth of a degree near the fovea to several degrees in the periphery. Withinthe receptive \ufb01elds, there are regions where illumination higher than the\nbackground light intensity enhances \ufb01ring, and other regions where lower\nillumination enhances \ufb01ring. The spatial arrangement of these regions de-\ntermines the selectivity of the neuron to different inputs. The term recep-tive\ufb01eld is often generalized to refer not only to the overall region where\nlight affects neuronal \ufb01ring, but also to the spatial and temporal structure\nwithin this region.\nVisually responsive neurons in the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nprimary\nvisualcortex\nlateral\ngeniculatenucleuslateralgeniculatenucleus\nretina\nretinaopticchiasm\nFigure 2.5: Pathway from the retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN)\nof the thalamus to the primary visual cortex in the human brain. (Adapted fromNicholls et al., 1992.)\nare divided into two classes depending on whether or not the contribu-\ntions from different locations within the visual \ufb01eld sum linearly, as as-\nsumed in equation 2.24. X-cells in the cat retina and LGN, P-cells in themonkey retina and LGN, and simple cells in primary visual cortex appearto satisfy this assumption. Other neurons, such as Y cells in the cat retina simple and\ncomplex cells and LGN, M cells in the monkey retina and LGN, and complex cells in\nprimary visual cortex, do not show linear summation across the spatialreceptive \ufb01eld and nonlinearities must be included in descriptions of their\nresponses. We do this for complex cells later in this chapter.\nA\ufb01rst step in studying the selectivity of any neuron is to identify the\ntypes of stimuli that evoke strong responses. Retinal ganglion cells andLGN neurons have similar selectivities and respond best to circular spotsof light surrounded by darkness or dark spots surrounded by light. In pri-mary visual cortex, many neurons respond best to elongated light or darkbars or to boundaries between light and dark regions. Gratings with alter-nating light and dark bands are effective and frequently used stimuli forthese neurons.\nMany visually responsive neurons react strongly to sudden transitions in\nthe level of image illumination, a temporal analog of their responsivenessto light-dark spatial boundaries. Static images are not very effective atevoking visual responses. In awake animals, images are constantly keptin motion across the retina by eye movements. In experiments in which theeyes are \ufb01xed, moving light bars and gratings, or gratings undergoing pe-\nriodic light-dark reversals (called counterphase gratings) are used as moreeffective stimuli than static images. Some neurons in primary visual cortexare directionally selective; they respond more strongly to stimuli movingin one direction than in the other.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n2.3 Introduction to the Early Visual System 11\nTo streamline the discussion in this chapter, we consider only greyscale\nimages, although the methods presented can be extended to include color.We also restrict the discussion to two-dimensional visual images, ignor-ing how visual responses depend on viewing distance and encode depth.In discussing the response properties of retinal, LGN, and V1 neurons,we do not follow the path of the visual signal, nor the historical order ofexperimentation, but, instead, begin with primary visual cortex and thenmove back to the LGN and retina. The emphasis is on properties of indi-vidual neurons, so we do not discuss encoding by populations of visuallyresponsive neurons. For V1, this has been analyzed in terms of wavelets,a scheme for decomposing images into component pieces, as discussed inchapter 10.\nThe Retinotopic Map\nA striking feature of most visual areas in the brain, including primary vi-sual cortex, is that the visual world is mapped onto the cortical surface ina topographic manner. This means that neighboring points in a visual im-age evoke activity in neighboring regions of visual cortex. The retinotopicmap refers to the transformation from the coordinates of the visual worldto the corresponding locations on the cortical surface.\nObjects located a \ufb01xed distance from one eye lie on a sphere. Locations\non this sphere can be represented using the same longitude and latitudeangles used for the surface of the earth. Typically, the \u2018north pole\u2019 forthis spherical coordinate system is located at the \ufb01xation point, the image\npoint that focuses onto the fovea or center of the retina. In this system ofcoordinates ( \ufb01gure 2.6), the latitude coordinate is called the eccentricity,\n/epsilon1, and the longitude coordinate, measured from the horizontal meridian, eccentricity /epsilon1\nazimuth a is called the azimuth a. In primary visual cortex, the visual world is split\nin half, with the region \u221290\u25e6\u2264a\u2264+ 90\u25e6for/epsilon1from 0\u25e6to about 70\u25e6(for\nboth eyes) represented on the left side of the brain, and the re \ufb02ection of\nthis region about the vertical meridian represented on the right side of thebrain.\nIn most experiments, images are displayed on a \ufb02at screen (called a tan-\ngent screen) that does not coincide exactly with the sphere discussed in theprevious paragraph. However, if the screen is not too large the differenceis negligible, and the eccentricity and azimuth angles approximately coin-cide with polar coordinates on the screen ( \ufb01gure 2.6A). Ordinary Cartesian\ncoordinates can also be used to identify points on the screen ( \ufb01gure 2.6).\nThe eccentricity\n/epsilon1and the xand ycoordinates of the Cartesian system are\nbased on measuring distances on the screen. However, it is customaryto divide these measured distances by the distance from the eye to thescreen and to multiply the result by 180\n\u25e6/\u03c0so that these coordinates are\nultimately expressed in units of degrees. This makes sense because it isthe angular not the absolute size and location of an image that is typicallyrelevant for studies of the visual system.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nFA B\nFa\nx\nya\n/AF/AF\nFigure 2.6: A) Two coordinate systems used to parameterize image location.

B) A bullseye pattern of radial lines of constant azimuth, and circlesof constant eccentricity. The center of this pattern at zero eccentricity is the \ufb01xation\npoint F. Such a pattern was used to generated the image in \ufb01gure 2.7A.\nFigure 2.7A shows a dramatic illustration of the retinotopic map in the\nprimary visual cortex of a monkey. The pattern on the cortex seen in \ufb01g-\nure 2.7A was produced by imaging a radioactive analog of glucose thatwas taken up by active neurons while a monkey viewed a visual imageconsisting of concentric circles and radial lines, similar to the pattern in\ufb01gure 2.6B. The vertical lines correspond to the circles in the image, and\nthe roughly horizontal lines are due to the activity evoked by the radiallines. The fovea is represented at the left-most pole of this piece of cortexand eccentricity increases toward the right. Azimuthal angles are positivein the lower half of the piece of cortex shown, and negative in the upperhalf.\nFigure 2.7B is an approximate mathematical description of the map illus-\ntrated in \ufb01gure 2.7A. To construct this map we assume that eccentricity\nis mapped onto the horizontal coordinate Xof the cortical sheet, and ais\nmapped onto its Ycoordinate.

(2.13)\nThe cortical magni \ufb01cation factor for the macaque monkey, obtained from\nresults such as \ufb01gure 2.7A is approximately\nM(/epsilon1)=\u03bb\n/epsilon10+/epsilon1. (2.14)\nwith\u03bb\u224812 mm and /epsilon10\u22481\u25e6. Integrating equation 2.13 and de \ufb01ning X=0\nto be the point representing /epsilon1=0, we \ufb01nd\nX=\u03bbln(1+/epsilon1//epsilon1 0). (2.15)\nWe can apply the same cortical ampli \ufb01cation factor to points with the\nsame eccentricity but different avalues. The angular distance between\ntwo points at eccentricity /epsilon1with an azimuthal angle difference of /Delta1ais\n/Delta1a/epsilon1\u03c0/180\u25e6. In this expression, the factor of /epsilon1corrects for the increase of\narc length as a function of eccentricity, and the factor of \u03c0/180\u25e6converts /epsilon1\nfrom degrees to radians. The separation on the cortex, /Delta1Y, corresponding\nto these points has a magnitude given by the cortical ampli \ufb01cation times\nthis distance. Taking the limit /Delta1a\u21920, we \ufb01nd that we \ufb01nd that\ndY\nda=\u2212/epsilon1\u03c0\n180\u25e6M(/epsilon1). (2.16)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nThe minus sign in this relationship appears because the visual \ufb01eld is in-\nverted on the cortex. Solving equation 2.16 gives\nY=\u2212\u03bb/epsilon1a\u03c0\n(/epsilon10+/epsilon1)180\u25e6. (2.17)\nFigure 2.7B shows that these coordinates agree fairly well with the map in\n\ufb01gure 2.7A.\nFor eccentricities appreciably greater than 1\u25e6, equations 2.15 and 2.17 re-\nduce to X\u2248\u03bbln(/epsilon1//epsilon1 0)and Y\u2248\u2212\u03bb\u03c0a/180\u25e6. These two formulae can be\ncombined by de \ufb01ning the complex numbers Z=X+iYand z=(/epsilon1//epsilon1 0)\nexp(\u2212i\u03c0a/180\u25e6)(with iequal to the square root of -1) and writing Z=\n\u03bbln(z). For this reason, the cortical map is sometimes called a complex\nlogarithmic map (see Schwartz, 1977). For an image scaled radially by a complex\nlogarithmic map factor \u03b3, eccentricities change according to /epsilon1\u2192\u03b3/epsilon1while ais unaffected.\nScaling of the eccentricity produces a shift X\u2192X+\u03bbln(\u03b3)over the range\nof values where the simple logarithmic form of the map is valid. The log-arithmic transformation thus causes images that are scaled radially out-ward on the retina to be represented at locations on the cortex translated intheXdirection. For smaller eccentricities, the map we have derived is only\napproximate even in the complete form given by equations 2.15 and 2.17.This is because the cortical magni \ufb01cation factor is not really isotropic as\nwe have assumed in this derivation, and a complete description requiresaccounting for the curvature of the cortical surface.\nVisual Stimuli\nEarlier in this chapter, we used the function s(t)to characterize a time-\ndependent stimulus. The description of visual stimuli is more complex.Greyscale images appearing on a two-dimensional surface, such as a videomonitor, can be described by giving the luminance, or light intensity, ateach point on the screen. These pixel locations are parameterized by Carte-sian coordinates xand y, as in the lower panel of \ufb01gure 2.6A. However,\npixel-by-pixel light intensities are not a useful way of parameterizing a vi-sual image for the purposes of characterizing neuronal responses. This isbecause visually responsive neurons, like many sensory neurons, adapt tothe overall level of screen illumination. To avoid dealing with adaptationeffects, we describe the stimulus by a function s\n(x,y,t)that is propor-\ntional to the difference between the luminance at the point (x,y)at time t\nand the average or background level of luminance. Often s(x,y,t)is also\ndivided by the background luminance level, making it dimensionless. Theresulting quantity is called the contrast.\nDuring recordings, visual neurons are usually stimulated by images that\nvary over both space and time. A commonly used stimulus, the counter-phase sinusoidal grating, is described by counterphase\nsinusoidal gratings\n(x,y,t)=Acos/parenleftbig\nKxcos/Theta1+Kysin/Theta1\u2212/Phi1/parenrightbig\ncos(\u03c9t).

This stimulus oscillates in both\nspace and time. At any \ufb01xed time, it oscillates in the direction perpendic-\nular to the orientation angle /Theta1as a function of position, with wavelength\n2\u03c0/K(\ufb01gure 2.8A). At any \ufb01xed position, it oscillates in time with period\n2\u03c0/\u03c9 (\ufb01gure 2.8B). For convenience, /Theta1is measured relative to the yaxis\nrather than the xaxis so that a stimulus with /Theta1=0, varies in the x, but not\nin the y, direction. /Phi1determines the spatial location of the light and dark\nstripes of the grating. Changing /Phi1by an amount /Delta1/Phi1 shifts the grating\nin the direction perpendicular to its orientation by a fraction /Delta1/Phi1/ 2\u03c0of its\nwavelength. The contrast amplitude Acontrols the maximum degree of\ndifference between light and dark areas. Because xand yare measured in\ndegrees, Khas the rather unusual units of radians per degree and K/2\u03c0is\ntypically reported in units of cycles per degree. /Phi1has units of radians, \u03c9\nis in radians per s, and \u03c9/2\u03c0is in Hz.\n\u0398\ns\nt0\nxyA B/BE /AP/BP /C3\n/BE /AP/BP /AX\nFigure 2.8: A counterphase grating.

B) The light-darkintensity at any point of the spatial grating oscillates sinusoidally in time with pe-riod 2\n\u03c0/\u03c9.\nExperiments that consider reverse correlation and spike-triggered aver-\nages use various types of random and white-noise stimuli in addition tobars and gratings. A white-noise stimulus, in this case, is one that is un- white-noise image\ncorrelated in both space and time so that\n1\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dt s(x,y,t)s(x/prime,y/prime,t+\u03c4)=\u03c32\ns\u03b4(\u03c4)\u03b4( x\u2212x/prime)\u03b4(y\u2212y/prime). (2.19)\nOf course, in practice a discrete approximation of such a stimulus must be\nused by dividing the image space into pixels and time into small bins. In\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\naddition, more structured random sets of images (randomly oriented bars,\nfor example) are sometime used to enhance the responses obtained duringstimulation.\nThe Nyquist Frequency\nMany factors limit the maximal spatial frequency that can be resolved bythe visual system, but one interesting effect arises from the size and spac-ing of individual photoreceptors on the retina. The region of the retinawith the highest resolution is the fovea at the center of the visual \ufb01eld.\nWithin the macaque or human fovea, cone photoreceptors are denselypacked in a regular array. Along any direction in the visual \ufb01eld, a reg-\nular array of tightly packed photoreceptors of size\n/Delta1xsamples points at\nlocations m/Delta1xform=1,2,.... The (angular) frequency that de \ufb01nes the\nresolution of such an array is called the Nyquist frequency and is given by Nyquist frequency\nKnyq=\u03c0\n/Delta1x. (2.20)\nTo understand the signi \ufb01cance of the Nyquist frequency, consider sam-\npling two cosine gratings with spatial frequencies of Kand 2 Knyq\u2212K, with\nK<Knyq. These are described by s=cos(Kx)and s=cos((2Knyq\u2212K)x).\nAt the sampled points, these functions are identical because cos ((2Knyq\u2212\nK)m/Delta1x)=cos(2\u03c0m\u2212Km/Delta1x)=cos(\u2212Km/Delta1x)=cos(Km/Delta1x)by the peri-\nodicity and evenness of the cosine function (see \ufb01gure 2.9). As a result,\nthese two gratings cannot be distinguished by examining them only at thesampled points. Any two spatial frequenices K\n<Knyqand 2 Knyq\u2212Kcan\nbe confused with each other in this way, a phenomenon known as aliasing.Conversely, if an image is constructed solely of frequencies less than K\nnyq,\nit can be reconstructed perfectly from the \ufb01nite set of samples provided\nby the array. There are 120 cones per degree at the fovea of the macaqueretina which makes K\nnyq/(2\u03c0)=1/(2/Delta1x)=60 cycles per degree. In this\nresult, we have divided the right side of equation 2.20, which gives Knyq\nin units of radians per degree, by 2 \u03c0to convert the answer to cycles per\ndegree.\n2.4 Reverse Correlation Methods - Simple Cells\nThe spike-triggered average for visual stimuli is de \ufb01ned, as in chapter 1,\nas the average over trials of stimuli evaluated at times ti\u2212\u03c4, where tifor\ni=1,2,..., nare the spike times.

Because visual stimuli depend on spatial location, we must decidehow contributions from different image locations are to be combined todetermine L\n(t). The simplest assumption is that the contributions from linear response\nestimate different spatial points add linearly so that L(t)is obtained by integrating\nover all xand yvalues,\nL(t)=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4/integraldisplay\ndxdy D (x,y,\u03c4)s(x,y,t\u2212\u03c4).

For some neurons, the kernel can be written asa product of two functions, one that describes the spatial receptive \ufb01eld\nand the other the temporal receptive \ufb01eld,\nD\n(x,y,\u03c4)=Ds(x,y)Dt(\u03c4). (2.26)\nSuch neurons are said to have separable space-time receptive \ufb01elds. Sep- separable\nreceptive \ufb01eld arability requires that the spatial structure of the receptive \ufb01eld does\nnot change over time except by an overall multiplicative factor. When\nD(x,y,\u03c4)cannot be written as the product of two terms, the neuron is\nsaid to have a nonseparable space-time receptive \ufb01eld. Given the freedom nonseparable\nreceptive \ufb01eld in equation 2.8 to set the scale of D(by suitably adjusting the function F),\nwe typically normalize Dsso that its integral is one, and use a similar rule\nfor the components from which Dtis constructed. We begin our analysis\nby studying \ufb01rst the spatial and then the temporal components of a sepa-\nrable space-time receptive \ufb01eld and then proceed to the nonseparable case.\nFor simplicity, we ignore the possibility that cells can have slightly differ-ent receptive \ufb01elds for the two eyes, which underlies the disparity tuning\nconsidered in chapter 1.\nSpatial Receptive Fields\nFigures 2.10A and C show the spatial structure of spike-triggered averagestimuli for two simple cells in the primary visual cortex of a cat (area 17)with approximately separable space-time receptive \ufb01elds. These receptive\n\ufb01elds are elongated in one direction, and there are some regions within the\nreceptive \ufb01eld where D\nsis positive, called ON regions, and others where\nit is negative, called OFF regions. The integral of the linear kernel timesthe stimulus can be visualized by noting how the OFF (black) and ON(white) regions overlap the image (see \ufb01gure 2.11) . The response of a neu-\nron is enhanced if ON regions are illuminated ( s\n>0) or if OFF regions\nare darkened ( s<0) relative to the background level of illumination. Con-\nversely, they are suppressed by darkening ON regions or illuminating OFFregions. As a result, the neurons of \ufb01gures 2.10A and C respond most vig-\norously to light-dark edges positioned along the border between the ONand OFF regions and oriented parallel to this border and to the elongateddirection of the receptive \ufb01elds ( \ufb01gure 2.11).

Figure 2.12 shows xand yplots of a vari-\nety of Gabor functions with different parameter values. As seen in \ufb01gure\n2.12, Gabor functions can have various types of symmetry, and variablenumbers of signi \ufb01cant oscillations (or subregions) within the Gaussian en-\nvelope. The number of subregions within the receptive \ufb01eld is determined\nby the product k\n\u03c3xand is typically expressed in terms of a quantity known\nas the bandwidth b. The bandwidth is de \ufb01ned as b=log2(K+/K\u2212)where bandwidth\nK+>kand K\u2212<kare the spatial frequencies of gratings that produce one\nhalf the response amplitude of a grating with K=k. High bandwidths\ncorrespond to low values of k\u03c3x, meaning that the receptive \ufb01eld has few\nsubregions and poor spatial frequency selectivity. Neurons with more sub-\ufb01elds are more selective to spatial frequency, and they have smaller band-\nwidths and larger values of k\n\u03c3x.\nThe bandwidth is the width of the spatial frequency tuning curve mea-\nsured in octaves. The spatial frequency tuning curve as a function of Kfor\na Gabor receptive \ufb01eld with preferred spatial frequency kand receptive\n\ufb01eld width \u03c3xis proportional to exp (\u2212\u03c32\nx(k\u2212K)2/2)(see equation 2.34\nbelow). The values of K+and K\u2212needed to compute the bandwidth are\nthus determined by the condition exp (\u2212\u03c32\nx(k\u2212K\u00b1)2/2)=1/2. Solving\nthis equation gives K\u00b1=k\u00b1(2l n(2))1/2/\u03c3xfrom which we obtain\nb=log2/parenleftbiggk\u03c3x+\u221a2l n(2)\nk\u03c3x\u2212\u221a\n2l n(2)/parenrightbigg\nork\u03c3x=/radicalbig\n2l n(2)2b+1\n2b\u22121. (2.28)\nBandwidth is only de \ufb01ned if k\u03c3x>\u221a\n2l n(2), but this is usually the case\nfor V1 neurons. For V1 neurons, bandwidths range from about 0.5 to 2.5corresponding to k\n\u03c3xbetween 1.7 and 6.9.\nThe response characterized by equation 2.27 is maximal if light-dark edges\nare parallel to the yaxis, so the preferred orientation angle is zero. An\narbitrary preferred orientation \u03b8can be generated by rotating the coordi-\nnates, making the substitutions x\u2192xcos(\u03b8)+ysin(\u03b8)and y\u2192ycos(\u03b8)\u2212 preferred\norientation \u03b8 xsin(\u03b8)in equation 2.27. This produces a spatial receptive \ufb01eld that is\nmaximally responsive to a grating with /Theta1=\u03b8. Similarly, a receptive \ufb01eld\ncentered at the point (x0,y0)rather than at the origin can be constructed\nby making the substitutions x\u2192x\u2212x0and y\u2192y\u2212y0. rf center x 0,y0\nTemporal Receptive Fields\nFigure 2.13 reveals the temporal development of the space-time receptive\n\ufb01eld of a neuron in the cat primary visual cortex through a series of snap\nshots of its spatial receptive \ufb01eld.

Although the magnitudes and signs of the\ndifferent spatial regions in \ufb01gure 2.13 vary over time, their locations and\nshapes remain fairly constant. This indicates that the neuron has, to a goodapproximation, a separable space-time receptive \ufb01eld. When a space-time\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

For the separable\nreceptive \ufb01eld given by the product of the spatial factor in equation 2.27\nand the temporal factor in 2.29, the linear estimate of the response can bewritten a product of two terms,\nL\n(t)=LsLt(t), (2.30)\nwhere\nLs=/integraldisplay\ndxdy D s(x,y)Acos/parenleftbig\nKxcos(/Theta1)+Kysin(/Theta1)\u2212/Phi1/parenrightbig.

In the x-tplot of \ufb01gure 2.18B, this image\nappears as a series of sloped dark and light bands.

A) A vertically\noriented grating moves to the left on a two-dimensional screen. B) The space-timediagram of the image in A. The xlocation of the dark and light bands moves to the\nleft as time progresses upward, representing the motion of the grating.\nMost neurons in primary visual cortex do not respond strongly to static\nimages, but respond vigorously to \ufb02ashed and moving bars and gratings.\nThe receptive \ufb01eld structure of \ufb01gure 2.17 reveals why this is the case, as\nis shown in \ufb01gures 2.19 and 2.20. The image in \ufb01gures 2.19A-C is a dark\nbar that is \ufb02ashed on for a brief period of time. To describe the linear\nresponse estimate at different times we show a cartoon of a space-timereceptive \ufb01eld similar to the one in \ufb01gure 2.17A. The receptive \ufb01eld is\npositioned at three different times in \ufb01gures 2.19A, B, and C. The height of\nthe horizontal axis of the receptive \ufb01eld diagram indicates the time when\nthe estimation is being made. Figure 2.19A corresponds to an estimate of\nL\n(t)at the moment when the image \ufb01rst appears. At this time, L(t)=0.\nAs time progresses, the receptive \ufb01eld diagram moves upward. Figure\n2.19B generates an estimate at the moment of maximum response whenthe dark image overlaps the OFF area of the space-time receptive \ufb01eld,\nproducing a positive contribution to L\n(t). Figure 2.19C shows a later time\nwhen the dark image overlaps an ON region, generating a negative L(t).\nThe response for this \ufb02ashed image is thus transient \ufb01ring followed by\nsuppression, as shown in Figure 2.19D.\nFigures 2.19E and F show why a static dark bar is an ineffective stimulus.\nThe static bar overlaps both the OFF region for small \u03c4and the reversed\nON region for large \u03c4, generating opposing positive and negative contri-\nbutions to L(t).T h e \ufb02ashed dark bar of \ufb01gures 2.19A-C is a more effective\nstimulus because there is a time when it overlaps only the OFF region.\nFigure 2.20 shows why a moving grating is a particularly effective stimu-\nlus.

As time pro-\ngresses and the receptive \ufb01eld moves upward in the \ufb01gure, the alignment\nwill sometimes be optimal, as in 2.20A, and sometimes non-optimal, as in2.20B. This produces an L\n(t)that oscillates as a function of time between\npositive and negative values (2.20C). Figures 2.20D-F show that a neuronwith this receptive \ufb01eld responds equally to a grating moving to the right.\nLike the left-moving grating in \ufb01gures 2.20A-C, the right-moving grating\ncan overlap the receptive \ufb01eld in an optimal manner (2.20D) producing\na strong response, or in a maximally negative manner (2.20E) producingstrong suppression of response, again resulting in an oscillating response(2.20F). Separable space-time receptive \ufb01elds can produce responses that\nare maximal for certain speeds of grating motion, but they are not sensitiveto the direction of motion.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nA\nxtBC\nD\nxtEF\nL(t) L(t)\nFigure 2.20: Responses to moving gratings estimated from a separable space-time\nreceptive \ufb01eld.

The responses are identical to those in A-C.\nNonseparable Receptive Fields\nMany neurons in primary visual cortex are selective for the direction of\nmotion of an image. Accounting for direction selectivity requires nonsepa-rable space-time receptive \ufb01elds. An example of a nonseparable receptive\n\ufb01eld is shown in \ufb01gure 2.21A. This neuron has a three-lobed OFF-ON-\nOFF spatial receptive \ufb01eld, and these subregions shift to the left as time\nmoves forward (and\n\u03c4decreases). This means that the optimal stimulus\nfor this neuron has light and dark areas that move toward the left. Oneway to describe a nonseparable receptive \ufb01eld structure is to use a sepa-\nrable function constructed from a product of a Gabor function for D\nsand\nequation 2.29 for Dt, but express these as functions of a mixture or rotation\nof the xand\u03c4variables. The rotation of the space-time receptive \ufb01eld, as\nseen in \ufb01gure 2.21B, is achieved by mixing the space and time coordinates\nusing the transformation\nD(x,y,\u03c4)=Ds(x/prime,y)Dt(\u03c4/prime) (2.35)\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The rotation operation is not the\nonly way to generate nonseparable space-time receptive \ufb01elds. They are\noften constructed by adding together two or more separable space-timereceptive \ufb01elds with different spatial and temporal characteristics.\nFigure 2.22 shows how a nonseparable space-time receptive \ufb01eld can pro-\nduce a response that is sensitive to the direction of motion of a grating.Figures 2.22A-C show a left-moving grating and, in 2.22A, the cartoon ofthe receptive \ufb01eld is positioned at a time when a light area of the image\noverlaps the central ON region and dark areas overlap the \ufb02anking OFF\nregions.

The simplest choice for Fconsistent with the positive nature of\n\ufb01ring rates, is recti \ufb01cation, F=G[L]+,w i t h Gset to \ufb01t the magnitude of\nthe measured \ufb01ring rates. However, this choice makes the \ufb01ring rate a lin-\near function of the contrast amplitude, which does not match the data onthe contrast dependence of visual responses. Neural responses saturate as contrast saturation\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

This ledHeeger (1992) to propose that an appropriate static nonlinearity to use is\nF\n(L)=G[L]2\n+\nA2\n1/2+G[L]2\n+(2.38)\nbecause this reproduces the observed contrast dependence. A number of\nvariants and extensions of this idea have also been considered, including,for example, that the denominator of this expression should include Lfac-\ntors for additional neurons with nearby receptive \ufb01elds. This can account\nfor the effects of visual stimuli outside the \u2018classical\u2019 receptive \ufb01eld. Dis-\ncussion of these effects is beyond the scope of this chapter.\n2.5 Static Nonlinearities - Complex Cells\nRecall that a large proportion of the neurons in primary visual cortex isseparated into classes of simple and complex cells. While linear methods,such as spike-triggered averages, are useful for revealing the propertiesof simple cells, at least to a \ufb01rst approximation, complex cells display fea-\ntures that are fundamentally incompatible with a linear description. Thespatial receptive \ufb01elds of complex cells cannot be divided into separate\nON and OFF regions that sum linearly to generate the response. Areaswhere light and dark images excite the neuron overlap making it dif \ufb01cult\nto measure and interpret spike-triggered average stimuli. Nevertheless,like simple cells, complex cells are selective to the spatial frequency andorientation of a grating. However, unlike simple cells, complex cells re-spond to bars of light or dark no matter where they are placed within theoverall receptive \ufb01eld. Likewise, the responses of complex cells to grating\nstimuli show little dependence on spatial phase. Thus, a complex cell is spatial phase\ninvariance selective for a particular type of image independent of its exact spatial po-\nsition within the receptive \ufb01eld. This may represent an early stage in the\nvisual processing that ultimately leads to position-invariant object recog-nition.\nComplex cells also have temporal response characteristics that distinguish\nthem from simple cells. Complex cell responses to moving gratings areapproximately constant, not oscillatory as in \ufb01gures 2.20 and 2.22. The\n\ufb01ring rate of a complex cell responding to a counterphase grating oscil-\nlating with frequency\n\u03c9has both a constant component and an oscillatory\ncomponent with a frequency of 2 \u03c9, a phenomenon known as frequency frequency doubling\ndoubling.\nEven though spike-triggered average stimuli and reverse correlation func-\ntions fail to capture the response properties of complex cells, complex-cell responses can be described, to a \ufb01rst approximation, by a relatively\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n32 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nstraightforward extension of the reverse correlation approach. The key ob-\nservation comes from equation 2.34, which shows how the linear responseestimate of a simple cell depends on spatial phase for an optimally ori-ented grating with Knot too small. Consider two such responses, labeled\nL\n1and L2, with preferred spatial phases \u03c6and\u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2. Including both the\nspatial and temporal response factors, we \ufb01nd, for preferred spatial phase\n\u03c6,\nL1=AB(\u03c9,K)cos(\u03c6\u2212/Phi1)cos(\u03c9t\u2212\u03b4) (2.39)\nwhere B(\u03c9,K)is a temporal and spatial frequency-dependent amplitude\nfactor. We do not need the explicit form of B(\u03c9,K)here, but the reader is\nurged to derive it. For preferred spatial phase \u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2,\nL2=AB(\u03c9,K)sin(\u03c6\u2212/Phi1)cos(\u03c9t\u2212\u03b4) (2.40)\nbecause cos (\u03c6\u2212\u03c0/2\u2212/Phi1)=sin(\u03c6\u2212/Phi1). If we square and add these two\nterms, we obtain a result that does not depend on /Phi1,\nL2\n1+L22=A2B2(\u03c9,K)cos2(\u03c9t\u2212\u03b4), (2.41)\nbecause cos2(\u03c6\u2212/Phi1)+sin2(\u03c6\u2212/Phi1)=1.

In computing the curve for \ufb01gure 2.23C, we used the exact expres-\nsions for L1and L2from the integrals in equations 2.31 and 2.32, not the\napproximation 2.34 used to simplify the discussion above. Although it isnot visible in the \ufb01gure, there is a weak dependence on\n/Phi1when the exact\nexpressions are used.\nThe complex cell response given by equations 2.42 and 2.41 reproduces\nthe frequency doubling effect seen in complex cell responses because thefactor cos\n2(\u03c9t\u2212\u03b4)oscillates with frequency 2 \u03c9.

However, they can each be constructed by\nsumming the squares of recti \ufb01ed outputs from two simple cells with pre-\nferred spatial phases separated by \u03c0.

While such a\nconstruction is possible, it should not be interpreted too literally becausecomplex cells receive input from many sources including the LGN andother complex cells. Rather, this model should be viewed as purely de-scriptive. Mechanistic models of complex cells are described at the end ofthis chapter and in chapter 7.\n2.6 Receptive Fields in the Retina and LGN\nWe end this discussion of the visual system by returning to the initialstages of the visual pathway and brie \ufb02y describing the receptive \ufb01eld\nproperties of neurons in the retina and LGN. Retinal ganglion cells dis-play a wide variety of response characteristics, including nonlinear anddirection-selective responses. However, a class of retinal ganglion cells (Xcells in the cat or P cells in the monkey retina and LGN) can be describedby a linear model built using reverse correlation methods. The receptive\ufb01elds of this class of retinal ganglion cells and an analogous type of LGN\nrelay neurons are similar, so we do not treat them separately. The spa-tial structure of the receptive \ufb01elds of these neurons has a center-surround\nstructure consisting either of a circular central ON region surrounded byan annular OFF region, or the opposite arrangement of a central OFF re-gion surrounded by an ON region. Such receptive \ufb01elds are called ON-\ncenter or OFF-center respectively. Figure 2.25A shows the spatial receptive\ufb01elds of an ON-center cat LGN neuron.\nThe spatial structure of retinal ganglion and LGN receptive \ufb01elds is well-\ncaptured by a difference-of-Gaussians model in which the spatial receptive difference of\nGaussians \ufb01eld is expressed as\nD\ns(x,y)=\u00b1/parenleftbigg1\n2\u03c0\u03c32cenexp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212x2+y2\n2\u03c32cen/parenrightbigg\n\u2212B\n2\u03c0\u03c32surexp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212x2+y2\n2\u03c32sur/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg\n.\n(2.45)\nHere the center of the receptive \ufb01eld has been placed at x=y=0.

The size of the central region is determined by the parameter\n\u03c3cen, while \u03c3sur, which is greater than \u03c3cen, determines the size of the sur-\nround.

Similarly, the OFF surround region changes to an ON re-\ngion with increasing \u03c4, although the reversal and the onset are slower for\nthe surround than for the central region. Because of the difference betweenthe time course of the center and surround regions, the space-time recep-tive\ufb01eld is not separable, although the center and surround components\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n36 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nare individually separable.

This means that the error of the prediction wasno worse than the variability of the neural response itself.\n2.7 Constructing V1 Receptive Fields\nThe models of visual receptive \ufb01elds we have been discussing are purely\ndescriptive, but they provide an important framework for studying howthe circuits of the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex generate neuralresponses. In an example of a more mechanistic model, Hubel and Wiesel(1962) showed how the oriented receptive \ufb01elds of cortical neurons could\nbe generated by summing the input from appropriately selected LGN neu-rons. Their construction, shown in \ufb01gure 2.27A, consists of alternating Hubel-Wiesel\nsimple cell model rows of ON-center and OFF-center LGN cells providing convergent input\nto a cortical simple cell. The left side of \ufb01gure 2.27A shows the spatial ar-\nrangement of LGN receptive \ufb01elds that, when summed, form bands of ON\nand OFF regions resembling the receptive \ufb01eld of an oriented simple cell.\nThis model accounts for the selectivity of a simple cell purely on the basisof feedforward input from the LGN. We leave the study of this model asan exercise for the reader. Other models, which we discuss in chapter 7,include the effects of recurrent intracortical connections as well.\nIn a previous section, we showed how the properties of complex cell re-\nsponses could be accounted for using a squaring static nonlinearity. Whilethis provides a good description of complex cells, there is little indicationthat complex cells actually square their inputs. Models of complex cellscan be constructed without introducing a squaring nonlinearity. One suchexample is another model proposed by Hubel and Wiesel (1962), whichis depicted in \ufb01gure 2.27B. Here the phase-invariant response of a com- Hubel-Wiesel\ncomplex cell model plex cell is produced by summing together the responses of several simple\ncells with similar orientation and spatial frequency tuning, but differentpreferred spatial phases. In this model, the complex cell inherits its orien-tation and spatial frequency preference from the simple cells that drive it,but spatial phase selectivity is reduced because the outputs of simple cellswith a variety of spatial phases selectivities are summed linearly. Analysisof this model is left as an exercise. While the model generates complex cellresponses, there are indications that complex cells in primary visual cor-tex are not exclusively driven by simple cell input. An alternative modelis considered in chapter 7.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n38 Neural Encoding II: Reverse Correlation and Visual Receptive Fields\nLGN receptive fieldssimple\n  cellOn OffOffcomplex\ncellAB\nsimple cells\n/AI/BN /CZ /BN \ua736/BD/AI/BN /CZ /BN \ua736/BE/AI/BN /CZ /BN \ua736/BF/AI/BN /CZ /BN \ua736/BG\nFigure 2.27: A) The Hubel-Wiesel model of orientation selectivity.

This produces a complex cell output that is selective for orientation andspatial frequency, but not for spatial phase. The \ufb01gure shows four simple cells\nconverging on a complex cell, but additional simple cells can be included to give amore complete coverage of spatial phase.\n2.8 Chapter Summary\nWe continued from chapter 1 our study of the ways that neurons encode\ninformation, focusing on reverse-correlation analysis, particularly as ap-plied to neurons in the retina, visual thalamus (LGN), and primary vi-sual cortex. We used the tools of systems identi \ufb01cation, especially the\nlinear \ufb01lter, Wiener kernel, and static nonlinearity to build descriptive lin-\near and nonlinear models of the transformation from dynamic stimuli totime-dependent \ufb01ring rates. We discussed the complex logarithmic map\ngoverning the way that neighborhood relationships in the retina are trans-formed into cortex, Nyquist sampling in the retina, and Gabor functions asdescriptive models of separable and nonseparable receptive \ufb01elds. Models\nbased on Gabor \ufb01lters and static nonlinearities were shown to account for\nthe basic response properties of simple and complex cells in primary visualcortex, including selectivity for orientation, spatial frequency and phase,velocity, and direction. Retinal ganglion cell and LGN responses weremodeled using a difference-of-Gaussians kernel. We brie \ufb02y described sim-\nple circuit models of simple and complex cells.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The self-consistency condi-tion is that when the nonlinear estimate r\nest=r0+F(L(t))is substituted\ninto equation 2.6, the relationship between the linear kernel and the \ufb01ring\nrate-stimulus correlation function should still hold.

(2.63)\nWe have dropped the r0term because the time integral of sis zero. In\ngeneral, equation 2.63 does not hold, but if the stimulus used to extract D\nis Gaussian white noise, equation 2.63 reduces to a simple normalizationcondition on the function F. This result is based on the identity, valid for a\nGaussian white-noise stimulus,\n1\n\u03c32sT/integraldisplayT\n0dt F(L(t))s(\u03c4\u2212t)=D(\u03c4)\nT/integraldisplayT\n0dtdF(L(t))\ndL. (2.64)\nFor the right side of this equation to be D(\u03c4), the remaining expression,\ninvolving the integral of the derivative of F, must be equal to one. This can\nbe achieved by appropriate scaling of F. The critical identity 2.64 is based\non integration by parts for a Gaussian weighted integral.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\nChapter 3\nNeural Decoding\n3.1 Encoding and Decoding\nIn chapters 1 and 2, we considered the problem of predicting neural re-\nsponses to known stimuli. The nervous system faces the reverse problem,determining what is going on in the real world from neuronal spiking pat-terns. It is interesting to attempt such computations ourselves, using theresponses of one or more neurons to identify a particular stimulus or to ex-tract the value of a stimulus parameter. We will assess the accuracy withwhich this can be done primarily by using optimal decoding techniques,regardless of whether the computations involved seem biologically plausi-ble. Some biophysically realistic implementations are discussed in chapter7. Optimal decoding allows us to determine limits on the accuracy and re-liability of neuronal encoding. In addition, it is useful for estimating theinformation content of neuronal spike trains, an issue addressed in chapter4.\nAs we discuss in chapter 1, neural responses, even to a single repeated\nstimulus, are typically described by stochastic models due to their inher-ent variability. In addition, the stimuli themselves are often describedstochastically. For example, the stimuli used in an experiment might bedrawn randomly from a speci \ufb01ed probability distribution. Natural stim-\nuli can also be modeled stochastically as a way of capturing the statisticalproperties of complex environments.\nGiven this two-fold stochastic model, encoding and decoding are re-\nlated through a basic identity of probability theory called Bayes theo-rem. Let rrepresent the response of a neuron or a population of neurons\nto a stimulus characterized by a parameter s. Throughout this chapter,\nr\n=(r1,r2,..., rN)forNneurons is a list of spike-count \ufb01ring rates, al-\nthough, for the present discussion, it could be any other set of parametersdescribing the neuronal response. Several different probabilities and con-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Neural Decoding\nditional probabilities enter into our discussion. A conditional probability conditional\nprobability is just an ordinary probability of an event occurring except that its occur-\nrence is subject to an additional condition. The conditional probability ofan event Aoccurring subject to the condition Bis denoted by P[A\n|B]. The\nprobabilities we need are:\n\u2022P[s], the probability of stimulus sbeing presented. This is often\ncalled the prior probability, prior probability\n\u2022P[r], the probability of response rbeing recorded,\n\u2022P[r,s], the probability of stimulus sbeing presented and response r\nbeing recorded,\n\u2022P[r|s], the conditional probability of evoking response rgiven that\nstimulus swas presented, and\n\u2022P[s|r], the conditional probability that stimulus swas presented\ngiven that the response rwas recorded.\nNote that P[r|s] is the probability of observing the rates rgiven that the\nstimulus took the value s, while P[r] is the probability of the rates taking\nthe values rindependent of what stimulus was used. P[r] can be com-\nputed from P[r|s] by summing over all stimulus values weighted by their\nprobabilities,\nP[r]=/summationdisplay\nsP[r|s]P[s] and similarly P[s]=/summationdisplay\nrP[s|r]P[r]. (3.1)\nAn additional relationship between the probabilities listed above can be\nderived by noticing that P[r,s] can be expressed as either the conditional\nprobability P[r|s] times the probability of the stimulus, or as P[s|r] times\nthe probability of the response,\nP[r,s]=P[r|s]P[s]=P[s|r]P[r]. (3.2)\nThis is the basis of Bayes theorem relating P[s|r]t oP[r|s], Bayes theorem\nP[s|r]=P[r|s]P[s]\nP[r], (3.3)\nassuming that P[r]/negationslash=0. Encoding is characterized by the set of probabili-\ntiesP[r|s] for all stimuli and responses. Decoding a response, on the other\nhand, amounts to determining the probabilities P[s|r]. According to Bayes\ntheorem, P[s|r] can be obtained from P[r|s], but the stimulus probability\nP[s] is also needed. As a result, decoding requires knowledge of the statis-\ntical properties of experimentally or naturally occurring stimuli.\nIn the above discussion, we have assumed that both the stimulus and re-\nsponse are characterized by discrete values so that ordinary probabilities,\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.2 Discrimination 3\nnot probability densities, are used to describe their distributions. For ex-\nample, \ufb01ring rates obtained by counting spikes over the duration of a trial\ntake discrete values and can be described by a probability. However, wesometimes treat the response \ufb01ring rates or the stimulus values as contin-\nuous variables. In this case, the probabilities listed must be replaced bythe corresponding probability densities, p[r],p[r\n|s], etc. Nevertheless, the\nrelationships discussed above are equally valid.\nIn the following sections, we present examples of decoding that involve\nboth single neurons and neuronal populations. We \ufb01rst study a restricted\ncase of single-cell decoding, discrimination between two different stimu-lus values. We then consider extracting the value of a parameter that char-acterizes a static stimulus from the responses of a population of neurons.As a \ufb01nal example, we return to single neurons and discuss spike-train\ndecoding in which an estimate of a time-varying stimulus is constructedfrom the spike train it evokes.\n3.2 Discrimination\nTo introduce the notion of discriminability and the receiver operating char-acteristic that lie at the heart of discrimination analysis, we will discuss afascinating study performed by Britten, Shadlen, Newsome and Movshon(1992). In their experiments, a monkey was trained to discriminate be-tween two directions of motion of a visual stimulus. The stimulus was apattern of dots on a video monitor that jump from random initial locationsto new locations every 45 ms. To introduce a sense of directed movementat a particular velocity, a percentage of the dots move together by a \ufb01xed\namount in a \ufb01xed direction ( \ufb01gure 3.1). The coherently moving dots are\nselected randomly at each time step, and the remaining dots move to ran-dom new locations. The percentage of dots that move together in the \ufb01xed\ndirection is called the coherence level. At 0% coherence, the image appearschaotic with no sense of any particular direction of motion. As the coher-ence increases, a sense of movement in a particular direction appears in theimage, until, at 100% coherence, the entire array of dots moves together onthe monitor. By varying the degree of coherence, the task of detecting themovement direction can be made more or less dif \ufb01cult.\nThe experiments combined neural recording with behavioral measure-\nments. In the behavioral part, the monkey had to report the direction ofmotion in the random dot images. During the same task, recordings weremade from neurons in area MT. Only two different possible directions ofcoherent movement of the dots were used while a particular neuron wasbeing recorded; either the direction that produced the maximum responsein that neuron, or the opposite direction. The monkey\u2019s task was to dis-criminate between these two directions. The \ufb01lled circles and solid curve\nin\ufb01gure 3.2A show the proportion of correct responses in a typical ex-\nperiment.

B) Firing rate histograms for three different levels ofcoherence. Hatched rectangles show the results for motion in the plus directionand solid rectangles for motion in the minus direction. The histograms have beenthinned for clarity so that not all the bins are shown. (Adapted from Britten et al.,1992 .)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.2 Discrimination 5\nFigure 3.2B shows histograms of average \ufb01ring rates in response to differ-\nent levels of movement coherence. The \ufb01ring rates plotted are the number\nof spikes recorded during the 2 s period that the stimulus was presented,divided by 2 s. The neuron shown tended to \ufb01re more spikes when the\nmotion was in its preferred direction, which we will call the plus (or \u2018\n+\u2019)\ndirection (hatched histogram), than in the other, minus (or \u2018 \u2212\u2019) direction\n(solid histogram). At high coherence levels, the \ufb01ring-rate distributions\ncorresponding to the two directions are fairly well separated, while at lowcoherence levels, they merge. Although spike count rates only take dis-crete values, it is more convenient to treat ras a continuous variable for our\ndiscussion. Treated as probability densities, these two distributions areapproximately Gaussian with the same variance,\n\u03c32\nr, but different means,\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright+for the plus direction and /angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u2212for the minus direction. A convenient\nmeasure of the separation between the distributions is the discriminability discriminability d/prime\nd/prime=/angbracketleftr/angbracketright+\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u2212\n\u03c3r(3.4)\nwhich is the distance between the means in units of their common stan-\ndard deviation. The larger d/prime, the more separated the distributions.\nIn the example we are considering, decoding involves using the neural re-\nsponse to determine in which of the two possible directions the stimulusmoved. A simple decoding procedure is to determine the \ufb01ring rate rdur-\ning a trial and compare it to a threshold number z.I fr\n\u2265z, we report plus;\notherwise we report minus. Figure 3.2B suggests that if we choose zto\nlie somewhere between the two distributions, this procedure will give thecorrect answer at high coherence, but will have dif \ufb01cultly distinguishing\nthe two directions for low coherence. This dif \ufb01culty is clearly related to\nthe degree to which the two distributions in \ufb01gure 3.2B overlap, and thus\nto the discriminability.\nThe probability that the procedure outlined in the previous paragraph will\ngenerate the correct answer (called a hit) when the stimulus is moving inthe plus direction is the conditional probability that r\n\u2265zgiven a plus stim-\nulus, P[r\u2265z|+]. The probability that it will give the answer plus when the\nstimulus is actually moving in the minus direction (called a false alarm)is similarly P[r\n\u2265z|\u2212]. These two probabilities completely determine the\nperformance of the decoding procedure because the probabilities for theother two cases, i.e. reporting minus when the correct answer is plus, andreporting minus when the correct answer is minus, are 1\n\u2212P[r\u2265z|+] and\n1\u2212P[r\u2265z|\u2212] respectively. In signal detection theory, the quantity used\nto perform the discrimination, rin our case, is called the test, and the\ntwo probabilities corresponding to reporting a plus answer have speci \ufb01ctest size and power\nor false alarm and\nhit ratenames:\n\u03b1(z)=P[r\u2265z|\u2212] is the size or false alarm rate of the test, and\n\u03b2(z)=P[r\u2265z|+] is the power or hit rate of the test .\n(3.5)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Neural Decoding\nThe following table shows how the probabilities of the test giving correct\nand incorrect answers in the different cases depend on \u03b1and\u03b2.\nprobability\nstimulus correct incorrect\n+ \u03b2 1\u2212\u03b2\n\u2212 1\u2212\u03b1 \u03b1\nThe performance of the decoding procedure we have been discussing\ndepends critically on the value of the threshold zto which the rate r\nis compared. Obviously, we would like to use a threshold for whichthe size is near 0 and the power near 1. In general, it is impossible tochoose the threshold so that both the size and power of the test are opti-mized; a compromise must be made. A logical optimization criterion isto maximize the probability of getting a correct answer, which is equal to\n(\u03b2(z)+1\u2212\u03b1(z))/2 if the plus and minus stimuli occur with equal proba-\nbility. While this is a possible approach for the experiment we are study-ing, the analysis we present introduces a powerful technique that makesbetter use of the full range of recorded data and can be generalized to taskswhere the optimal strategy is unknown. This approach makes use of ROCcurves, which indicate how the size and power of a test trade off as thethreshold is varied.\nROC Curves\nThe receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve provides a way of eval-uating how test performance depends on the choice of the threshold z. receiver operating\ncharacteristic, ROC Each point on an ROC curve corresponds to a different value of z.T h e x\ncoordinate of the point is\n\u03b1, the size of the test for this value of z, and the\nycoordinate is \u03b2, its power. As the threshold is varied continuously, these\npoints trace out the ROC plot. If z=0, the \ufb01ring rate will always be greater\nthan or equal to z, so the decoding procedure will always give the answer\nplus. Thus, for z=0,\u03b1=\u03b2=1, producing a point at the upper-right corner\nof the ROC plot. At the other extreme, if zis very large, rwill always be\nless than z, the test will always report minus, and \u03b1=\u03b2=0. This produces\na point at the bottom-left corner of the plot. Between these extremes, acurve is traced out as a function of z.\nFigure 3.3 shows ROC curves computed by Britten et al. for several dif-\nferent values of the stimulus coherence. At high coherence levels, whenthe task is easy, the ROC curve rises rapidly from\n\u03b1(z)=0,\u03b2(z)=0a st h e\nthreshold is lowered from a very high value, and the probability \u03b2(z)of a\ncorrect plus answer quickly approaches 1 without a concomitant increasein\n\u03b1(z).

This is exactly thetrend of the ROC curves at different coherence levels shown in \ufb01gure 3.3.\nExamination of \ufb01gure 3.3 suggests a relationship between the area under\nthe ROC curve and the level of performance on the task. When the ROCcurve in \ufb01gure 3.3 lies along the diagonal, the area underneath it is 1/2,\nwhich is the probability of a correct answer in this case (given any thresh-old).

This removes the threshold variable from\nconsideration.\nIn the two-alternative forced choice task, the value of ron one trial serves\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Neural Decoding\nas the threshold for the other trial. For example, if the order of stimu-\nlus presentation is plus then minus, the comparison procedure we haveoutlined will report the correct answer if r\n1\u2265zwhere z=r2, and this has\nprobability P[r1\u2265z|+]=\u03b2(z)with z=r2. To determine the probability\nof getting the correct answer in a two-alternative forced choice task, weneed to integrate this probability over all possible values of r\n2weighted\nby their probability of occurrence. For small /Delta1z, the probability that r2\ntakes a value in the range between zand z+/Delta1zwhen the second trial has\na minus stimulus is p[z|\u2212]/Delta1z, where p[z|\u2212] is the conditional \ufb01ring rate\nprobability density for a \ufb01ring rate r=z. Integrating over all values of z\ngives the probability of getting the correct answer,\nP[correct] =/integraldisplay\u221e\n0dz p[z|\u2212]\u03b2(z). (3.6)\nBecause the two-alternative forced choice test is symmetric, this is also the\nprobability of being correct if the order of the stimuli is reversed.\nThe probability that r\u2265zfor a minus stimulus, which is just \u03b1(z),c a n\nbe written as an integral of the conditional \ufb01ring-rate probability density\np[r|\u2212],\n\u03b1(z)=/integraldisplay\u221e\nzdr p[r|\u2212]. (3.7)\nTaking the derivative of this equation with respect to zwe\ufb01nd that\nd\u03b1\ndz=\u2212 p[z|\u2212]. (3.8)\nThis allows us to make the replacement dz p[z|\u2212]\u2192\u2212 d\u03b1in the integral\nof equation 3.6 and to change the integration variable from zto\u03b1.

(3.9)\nThe ROC curve is just \u03b2plotted as a function or \u03b1, so this integral is exactly\nthe area under the ROC curve. Thus, the area under the ROC curve isexactly the probability of error in the two-alternative forced choice test.\nSuppose that p[r\n|+] and p[r|\u2212] are both Gaussian functions with means\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright+and/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u2212, and a common variance \u03c32\nr.

(3.11)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.2 Discrimination 9\nIn the case that the distributions are equal-variance Gaussians, the rela-\ntionship between the discriminability and the area under the ROC curveis invertible because the complementary error function is monotonic. It iscommon to quote d\n/primevalues even for non-Gaussian distributions by invert-\ning the relationship between P[correct] and d/primein equation 3.10.\nROC Analysis of Motion Discrimination\nTo interpret their experiment as a two-alternative forced choice task, Brit-\nten et al. imagined that, in addition to being given the \ufb01ring rate of the\nrecorded neuron during stimulus presentation, the observer is given the\ufb01ring rate of a hypothetical \u2018anti-neuron\u2019 having exactly the opposite re-\nsponse characteristics from the recorded neuron. In reality, the responsesof this anti-neuron to a plus stimulus were just those of the recorded neu-ron to a minus stimulus, and vice versa. The idea of using the responsesof a single neuron to opposite stimuli as if they were the simultaneousresponses of two different neurons reappears again in our discussion ofspike train decoding. An observer predicting motion directions on the ba-sis of just these two neurons at a level equal to the area under the ROCcurve is termed an ideal observer.\nFigure 3.2A shows a typical result for the performance of an ideal observer\nusing one recorded neuron and its anti-neuron partner. The open circles in\ufb01gure 3.2A were obtained by calculated the areas under the ROC curves\nfor this neuron. Amazingly, the ability of the ideal observer to performthe discrimination task using a single neuron/anti-neuron pair is equal tothe ability of the monkey to do the task. Although the choices of the idealobserver and the monkey do not necessarily match on a trial-to-trial basis,their performances are comparable when averaged over trials. This seemsremarkable because the monkey presumably has access to a large popula-tion of neurons, while the ideal observer uses only two. One speculationis that correlations in the response variability between neurons limit theperformance of the monkey.\nThe Likelihood Ratio Test\nThe discrimination test we have considered compares the \ufb01ring rate to a\nthreshold value. Could an observer do better than this already remark-able performance by comparing some other function of the \ufb01ring rate to\na threshold? What is the best test function to use for this purpose? TheNeyman-Pearson lemma (proven in appendix A) shows that it is impossi- Neyman-Pearson\nlemma ble to do better than to chose the test function to be the ratio of probability\ndensities (or, where appropriate, probabilities),\nl\n(r)=p[r|+]\np[r|\u2212], (3.12)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Neural Decoding\nwhich is known as the likelihood ratio. The test function rused above is likelihood ratio\nnot equal to the likelihood ratio. However, if the likelihood is a mono-tonically increasing function of r, as it is for the data of Britten et al., the\n\ufb01ring-rate threshold test is equivalent to using the likelihood ratio and is\nindeed optimal. Similarly, any monotonic function of the likelihood ratiowill provide as good a test as the likelihood itself, and the logarithm isfrequently used.\nThere is a direct relationship between the likelihood ratio and the ROC\ncurve. As in equations 3.7 and 3.8, we can write\n\u03b2(z)=/integraldisplay\u221e\nzdr p[r|+]d\u03b2\ndz=\u2212 p[z|+]. (3.13)\nCombining this result with 3.8, we \ufb01nd that\nd\u03b2\nd\u03b1=d\u03b2\ndzdz\nd\u03b1=p[z|+]\np[z|\u2212]=l(z), (3.14)\nso the slope of the ROC curve is equal to the likelihood ratio.\nAnother way of seeing that comparing the likelihood ratio to a threshold\nvalue is an optimal decoding procedure for discrimination uses a Bayesianapproach based on associating a cost or penalty with getting the wronganswer. Suppose that the penalty associated with answering minus whenthe correct answer is plus is quanti \ufb01ed by the loss parameter L\n\u2212. Similarly, loss parameter\nquantify the loss for answering plus when the correct answer is minus as\nL+. For convenience, we assume that there is neither loss nor gain for\nanswering correctly. The probabilities that the correct answer is plus orminus given the \ufb01ring rate rareP[\n+|r] and P[\u2212|r] respectively. These\nprobabilities are related to the conditional \ufb01ring-rate probability densities\nby Bayes Theorem,\nP[+|r]=p[r|+]P[+]\np[r]and P[\u2212|r]=p[r|\u2212]P[\u2212]\np[r]. (3.15)\nThe average loss expected for a plus answer when the \ufb01ring rate is ris the\nloss associated with being wrong times the probability of being wrong,Loss\n+=L+P[\u2212|r]. Similarly the expected loss when answering minus is\nLoss \u2212=L\u2212P[+|r]. A reasonable strategy is to \u2018cut the losses\u2019, answering\nplus if Loss +\u2264Loss \u2212and minus otherwise. Using equation 3.15, we \ufb01nd\nthat this strategy gives the response plus if\nl(r)=p[r|+]\np[r|\u2212]\u2265L+\nL\u2212P[\u2212]\nP[+]. (3.16)\nThis shows that the strategy of comparing the likelihood ratio to a thresh-\nold is a way of minimizing the expected loss. The right hand side of this in-equality gives an explicit formula for the value of the threshold that shouldbe used, and re \ufb02ects two factors. One is the relative losses for the two sorts\nof possible errors. The other is the prior probabilities that the stimulus is\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.3 Population Decoding 11\nplus or minus. Interestingly, it is possible to change the thresholds that\nhuman subjects use in discrimination tasks by manipulating these two fac-tors.\nIf the conditional probability densities p[r\n|+] and p[r|\u2212] are Gaussians\nwith means r+and r\u2212and identical variances \u03c32\nr, and P[+]=P[\u2212]=1/2,\nthe probability P[+|r] is a sigmoidal function of r\nP[+|r]=1\n1+exp(\u2212d/prime(r\u2212rave)/\u03c3 r)(3.17)\nwhere rave=(r++r\u2212)/2. This provides an alternate interpretation of the\nparameter d/primethat is often used in the psychophysics literature; it deter-\nmines the slope of a sigmoidal \ufb01tt oP[+|r].\nWe have so far considered discriminating between two quite distinct stim-\nulus values, plus and minus. Often we are interested in discriminatingbetween two stimulus values s\n+/Delta1sand sthat are very close to each other.\nIn this case, the likelihood ratio is\np[r|s+/Delta1s]\np[r|s]\u2248p[r|s]+/Delta1s\u2202p[r|s]/\u2202s\np[r|s]\n=1+/Delta1s\u2202lnp[r|s]\n\u2202s.\nFor small /Delta1s, a test that compares\nZ(r)=\u2202lnp[r|s]\n\u2202s(3.18)\nto a threshold (z\u22121)//Delta1sis equivalent to the likelihood ratio test. The\nfunction Z(r)is sometimes called the score. score Z (r)\n3.3 Population Decoding\nThe use of large numbers of neurons to perform tasks is one of the ba-\nsic operating principles of most nervous systems. Population coding has anumber of advantages, including reduction of uncertainty due to neuronalvariability and the ability to represent a number of different stimulus at-tributes simultaneously. Individual neurons in such a population typicallyhave different but overlapping selectivities so that many neurons, but notnecessarily all, respond to a given stimulus. In the previous section, wediscussed discrimination between stimuli on the basis of the response ofa single neuron. The responses of a population of neurons can also beused for discrimination, with the only essential difference being that termssuch as p[r\n|s] are replaced by p[r|s], the conditional probability density of\nthe population response r. ROC analysis, likelihood ratio tests, and the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Neural Decoding\nNeyman-Pearson lemma continue to apply in exactly the same way. Dis-\ncrimination is a special case of decoding in which only few different stim-ulus values are considered. A more general problem is the extraction of acontinuous stimulus parameter from one or more neuronal responses. Inthis section, we study how the value of a continuous parameter associatedwith a static stimulus can be decoded from the spike-count \ufb01ring rates of\na population of neurons.\nEncoding and Decoding Direction\nThe cercal system of the cricket, used to report the direction of incom-ing air currents as a warning of approaching predators, is an interestingexample of population coding involving a relatively small number of neu-rons. Crickets and other related insects have two appendages called cerciextending from their hind ends. These are covered with hairs that are de-\ufb02ected by air currents. Each hair is attached to a neuron that \ufb01res when\nthe hair is de \ufb02ected. Thousands of these primary sensory neurons send\naxons to a set of interneurons that relay the sensory information to the restof the cricket\u2019s nervous system. No single interneuron of the cercal systemresponds to all wind directions, and multiple interneurons respond to anygiven wind direction. This implies that the interneurons encode the winddirection collectively as a population.\nTheunissen and Miller (1991) measured both the mean and the variance\nof responses of cercal interneurons while blowing air currents at the cerci.At low wind velocities, information about wind direction is encoded byjust four interneurons. Figure 3.4 shows average \ufb01ring rate tuning curves\nfor the four relevant interneurons as a function of wind direction. Theseneurons are sensitive primarily to the angle of the wind around the ver-\n360 270 180 90 00.00.51.0\ns (degrees)f/rmax\nFigure 3.4: Tuning curves for the four low-velocity interneurons of the cricket cer-\ncal system plotted as a function of the wind direction s. Each neuron responds with\na\ufb01ring rate that closely approximated by a half-wave recti \ufb01ed cosine function. The\npreferred directions of the neurons are located 90\u25e6from each other, and rmaxvalues\nare typically around 40 Hz. Error bars show standard deviations.

Wind speed\nwas held constant in these experiments so we do not discuss how it isencoded. The interneuron tuning curves are well approximated by half-wave recti \ufb01ed cosine functions. Neuron a(where a\n=1,2,3,4) responds\nwith a maximum average \ufb01ring rate when the angle of the wind direction\nissa, the preferred direction angle for that neuron. The tuning curve for\ninterneuron ain response to wind direction s,/angbracketleftra/angbracketright= fa(s), normalized to\nits maximum, can be written as cosine tuning\n/parenleftbiggf(s)\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na=[(cos(s\u2212sa)]+ (3.19)\nwhere the half-wave recti \ufb01cation eliminates negative \ufb01ring rates. Here\nrmax, which may be different for each neuron, is a constant equal to the\nmaximum average \ufb01ring rate. The \ufb01t can be improved somewhat by in-\ntroducing a small offset rate, but the simple cosine is adequate for ourpurposes.\nTo determine the wind direction from the \ufb01ring rates of the cercal interneu-\nrons it is useful to change the notation somewhat. In place of the angle s,\nwe can represent wind direction by a spatial vector\n/vectorvpointing parallel to\nthe wind velocity and having unit length, |/vectorv|=1 (we use over-arrows to\ndenote spatial vectors). Similarly, we can represent the preferred wind di-rection for each interneuron by a vector\n/vectorcaof unit length pointing in the\ndirection speci \ufb01ed by the angle sa. In this case, we can use the vector dot\nproduct to write /vectorv\u00b7/vectorca=cos(s\u2212sa). In terms of these vectors, the average dot product\n\ufb01ring rate is proportional to a half-wave recti \ufb01ed projection of the wind\ndirection vector onto the preferred direction axis of the neuron,\n/parenleftbiggf(s)\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na=/bracketleftbig/vectorv\u00b7/vectorca/bracketrightbig\n+. (3.20)\nDecoding the cercal system is particularly easy because of the close rela-\ntionship between the representation of wind direction it provides and atwo-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. In a Cartesian system, vec-tors are parameterized by their projections onto xand yaxes,\nvxandvy.\nThese projections can be written as dot products of the vector being rep-resented,\n/vectorv, with vectors of unit length /vectorxand/vectorylying along the xand y\naxes,vx=/vectorv\u00b7/vectorxandvy=/vectorv\u00b7/vectory. Except for the half-wave recti \ufb01cation, these\nequations are identical to 3.20. Furthermore, the preferred directions ofthe four interneurons, like the xand yaxes of a Cartesian coordinate sys-\ntem, lie along two perpendicular directions ( \ufb01gure 3.5A). Four neurons are\nrequired, rather than two, because \ufb01ring rates cannot represent negative\nprojections. The cricket discovered the Cartesian coordinate system longbefore Descartes, but failed to invent negative numbers! Perhaps creditshould also be given to the leech, for Lewis and Kristan (1998) have shownthat the direction of touch sensation in its body segments is encoded byfour neurons in a virtually identical arrangement.\nA vector\n/vectorvcan be reconstructed from its Cartesian components through the\ncomponent-weighted vector sum /vectorv=vx/vectorx+vy/vectory. Because the \ufb01ring rates of\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Neural Decoding\nc1\nc2 c3c4\nvr1\nr2AB\n-180 90 180 -90 002468\nwind direction (degrees )error (degrees )\nFigure 3.5: A) Preferred directions of four cercal interneurons in relation to the\ncricket\u2019s body. The \ufb01ring rate of each neuron for a \ufb01xed wind speed is propor-\ntional to the projection of the wind velocity vector /vectorvonto the preferred direction\naxis of the neuron. The projection directions /vectorc1,/vectorc2,/vectorc3and/vectorc4for the four neurons\nare separated by 90\u25e6, and they collectively form a Cartesian coordinate system.\nB) The root-mean-square error in the wind direction determined by vector decod-ing of the \ufb01ring rates of four cercal interneurons. These results were obtained\nthrough simulation by randomly generating interneuron responses to a variety ofwind directions, with the average values and trial-to-trial variability of the \ufb01ring\nrates matched to the experimental data. The generated rates were then decodedusing equation 3.21 and compared to the wind direction used to generate them. (Badapted from Salinas and Abbott, 1994.)\nthe cercal interneurons we have been discussing are proportional to the\nCartesian components of the wind direction vector, a similar sum shouldallow us to reconstruct the wind direction from a knowledge of the in-terneuron \ufb01ring rates, except that four, not two, terms must be included.\nIfr\nais the spike-count \ufb01ring rate of neuron a, an estimate of the wind di-\nrection on any given trial can be obtained from the direction of the vector population vector\n/vectorvpop=4/summationdisplay\na=1/parenleftbiggr\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na/vectorca. (3.21)\nThis vector is known as the population vector, and the associated decod-\ning method is called the vector method. This decoding scheme works quite vector method\nwell. Figure 3.5B shows the root-mean-square difference between the di-rection determined by equation 3.21 and the actual wind direction thatevoked the \ufb01ring rates. The difference between the decoded and actual\nwind directions is around 6\n\u25e6except for dips at the angles corresponding\nto the preferred directions of the neurons. These dips are not due to thefact that one of the neurons responds maximally, but rather arise becausethe two neurons with tuning curves adjacent to the maximally respondingneuron are most sensitive to wind direction at these points.\nAs discussed in chapter 1, tuning curves of certain neurons in the primary\nmotor cortex (M1) of the monkey can be described by cosine functions of\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.3 Population Decoding 15\narm movement direction. Thus, a vector decomposition similar to that of\nthe cercal system appears to take place in M1. Many M1 neurons havenonzero offset rates so they can represent the cosine function over most orall of its range. When an arm movement is made in the direction repre-sented by a vector of unit length,\n/vectorv, the average \ufb01ring rates for such an M1\nneuron, labeled by an index a, (assuming that it \ufb01res over the entire range\nof angles) can be written as\n/parenleftbigg/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u2212r0\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na=/parenleftbiggf(s)\u2212r0\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na=/vectorv\u00b7/vectorca (3.22)\nwhere /vectorcais the preferred direction vector that de \ufb01nes the selectivity of\nthis neuron. Because these \ufb01ring rates represent the full cosine function,\nit would, in principle, be possible to encode all movement directions inthree dimensions using just three neurons. Instead, many thousands of M1neurons have arm-movement related tuning curves resulting in a highlyredundant representation. Of course, these neurons encode additionalmovement-related quantities, for example, their \ufb01ring rates depend on the\ninitial position of the arm relative to the body as well as on movement ve-locity and acceleration. This complicates the interpretation of their activityas reporting movement direction in a particular coordinate system.\nUnlike the cercal interneuron, M1 neurons do not have orthogonal pre-\nferred directions that form a Cartesian coordinate system. Instead, thepreferred directions of the neurons appear to point in all directions withroughly equal probability. If the projection axes are not orthogonal, theCartesian sum of equation 3.21 is not the correct way to reconstruct\n/vectorv. Nev-\nertheless, if the preferred directions point uniformly in all directions andthe number of neurons Nis suf \ufb01ciently large, the population vector\n/vectorvpop=N/summationdisplay\na=1/parenleftbiggr\u2212r0\nrmax/parenrightbigg\na/vectorca (3.23)\nwill, on average, point in a direction parallel to the arm movement direc-\ntion vector /vectorv.

Later in this chapter, we discuss how corrections can be made if thedistribution of preferred directions is not uniform or the number of neu-rons is not large. The population vectors constructed from equation 3.23on the basis of responses of neurons in primary motor cortex recordedwhile a monkey performed a reaching task are compared with the actualdirections of arm movements in \ufb01gure 3.6.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Neural Decoding\nFigure 3.6: Comparison of population vectors with actual arm movement direc-\ntions. Results are shown for eight different movement directions. Actual armmovement directions are radially outward at angles that are multiples of 45\n\u25e6.\nThe groups of lines without arrows show the preferred direction vectors of therecorded neurons multiplied by their \ufb01ring rates. Vector sums of these terms\nfor each movement direction are indicated by the arrows. The fact that the ar-rows point approximately radially outward shows that the population vector re-constructs the actual movement direction fairly accurately. (Figure adapted fromKandel et al., 1991 based on data from Kalaska et al., 1983.)\nOptimal Decoding Methods\nThe vector method is a simple decoding method that can perform quite\nwell in certain cases, but it is neither a general nor an optimal way to re-construct a stimulus from the \ufb01ring rates of a population of neurons. In\nthis section, we discuss two methods that can, by some measure, be con-sidered optimal. These are called Bayesian and maximum a posteriori or\nMAP inference. We also discuss a special case of MAP called maximumlikelihood or ML inference. The Bayesian approach involves \ufb01nding the\nminimum of a loss function that expresses the cost of estimation errors.MAP and ML inference generally produce estimates that are as accurate,in terms of the variance of the estimate, as any that can be achieved by awide class of estimation methods (so-called unbiased estimates), at leastwhen large numbers of neurons are used in the decoding. Bayesian andMAP estimates use the conditional probability that a stimulus parametertakes a value between sand s\n+/Delta1sgiven that the set of Nencoding neurons\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.3 Population Decoding 17\n\ufb01red at rates given by r. The probability density needed for a continuous\nstimulus parameter, p[s|r], can be obtained from the encoding probability\ndensity p[r|s] by the continuous version of Bayes theorem (equation 3.3),\np[s|r]=p[r|s]p[s]\np[r]. (3.25)\nA disadvantage of these methods is that extracting p[s|r] from experimen-\ntal data can be dif \ufb01cult. In contrast, the vector method only requires us to\nknow the preferred stimulus values of the encoding neurons,\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, Bayesian inference is based on\nthe minimization of a particular loss function L(s,sbayes)that quanti \ufb01es Bayesian inference\nthe \u2018cost\u2019 of reporting the estimate sbayes when the correct answer is s.T h e\nloss function provides a way of de \ufb01ning the optimality criterion for de-\ncoding analogous to the loss computation discussed previously for opti-mal discrimination. The value of s\nbayes is chosen to minimize the expected\nloss averaged over all stimuli for a given set of rates, i.e. to minimize thefunction/integraltext\nds L\n(s,sbayes)p[s|r]. If the loss function is the squared difference\nbetween the estimate and the true value, L(s,sbayes)=(s\u2212sbayes)2, the es-\ntimate that minimizes the expected loss is the mean\nsbayes=/integraldisplay\nds p[s|r]s. (3.26)\nIf the loss function is the absolute value of the difference, L(s,sbayes)=\n|s\u2212sbayes|, then sbayes is the median rather than the mean of the distribution\np[s|r].\nMaximum a posteriori (MAP) inference does not involve a loss function but MAP inference\ninstead simply chooses the stimulus value, sMAP, that maximizes the con-\nditional probability density of the stimulus, p[sMAP|r]. The MAP approach\nis thus to choose as the estimate sMAP the most likely stimulus value for\na given set of rates. If the prior or stimulus probability density p[s] is in-\ndependent of s,p[s|r] and p[r|s] have the same dependence on s, because\nthe factor p[s]/p[r] in equation 3.25 is independent of s. In this case, the\nMAP algorithm is equivalent to maximizing the likelihood function, i.e.choosing s\nMLto maximize p[r|sML], which is called maximum likelihood ML inference\n(ML) inference.\nPreviously we applied the vector decoding method to the cercal system\nof the cricket. Figure 3.7 shows the root-mean-square difference betweenthe true and estimated wind directions for the cercal system using ML andBayesian methods. For the cercal interneurons, the response probabilitydensity p[r\n|s] is a product of four Gaussians with means and variances\ngiven by the data points and error bars in \ufb01gure 3.4. The Bayesian esti-\nmate in \ufb01gure 3.7 is based on the squared-difference loss function. Both\nestimates use a constant stimulus probability density p[s], so the ML and\nMAP estimates are identical. The maximum likelihood estimate is eithermore or less accurate than the Bayesian estimate, depending on the angle.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Neural Decoding\n-180 -90 0 90 18002468\n-180 -90 0 90 18002468error (degrees)\n wind direction (degrees)maximum likelihood Bayesian\n wind direction (degrees)\nFigure 3.7: Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation errors for the cricket\ncercal system. ML and Bayesian estimates of the wind direction were comparedwith the actual stimulus value for a large number of simulated \ufb01ring rates. Firing\nrates were generated as for \ufb01gure 3.5B. The error shown is the root-mean-squared\ndifference between the estimated and actual stimulus angles. (Adapted from Sali-nas and Abbott, 1994.)\nThe Bayesian result has a slightly smaller average error across all angles.\nThe dips in the error curves in \ufb01gure 3.7, as in the curve of \ufb01gure 3.5B,\nappear at angles where one tuning curve peaks and two others rise fromthreshold (see \ufb01gure 3.4). As in \ufb01gure 3.5B these dips are due to the two\nneurons responding near threshold, not to the maximally responding neu-ron. They occur because neurons are most sensitive at points where theirtuning curves have maximum slopes which, in this case, is near threshold(see\ufb01gure 3.11). Comparing these results with \ufb01gure 3.5B shows the im-\nproved performance of these methods relative to the vector method. Thevector method performs extremely well for this system, so the degree ofimprovement is not large. This is because the cercal responses are welldescribed by cosine functions and their preferred directions are 90\n\u25e6apart.\nMuch more dramatic differences occur when the tuning curves are notcosines or the preferred stimulus directions are not perpendicular.\nUp to now, we have considered the decoding of a direction angle. We now\nturn to the more general case of decoding an arbitrary continuous stimulusparameter.

It is possible to have\nra>rmax(point at sa=0) because rmaxis the maximum average \ufb01ring rate, not the\nmaximum \ufb01ring rate.\nTo apply the ML estimation algorithm, we only need to consider the terms\ninP[r|s] that depend on s. Because equation 3.29 involves a product, it is\nconvenient to take its logarithm and write\nlnP[r|s]=TN/summationdisplay\na=1raln/parenleftbig\nfa(s)/parenrightbig+... (3.30)\nwhere the ellipsis represents terms that are independent or approximately\nindependent of s, including, as discussed above,/summationtextfa(s). Because maxi-\nmizing a function and maximizing its logarithm are equivalent, we can usethe logarithm of the conditional probability in place of the actual probabil-ity in ML decoding.\nThe ML estimated stimulus, s\nML, is the stimulus that maximizes the right-\nhand side of equation 3.30.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.3 Population Decoding 21\nIf all the tuning curves have the same width, this reduces to\nsML=/summationtextrasa/summationtextra, (3.33)\nwhich is a simple estimation formula with an intuitive interpretation as\nthe\ufb01ring-rate weighted average of the preferred values of the encoding\nneurons. The numerator of this expression is reminiscent of the populationvector.\nAlthough equation 3.33 gives the ML estimate for a population of neurons\nwith Poisson variability, it has some undesirable properties as a decodingalgorithm. Consider a neuron with a preferred stimulus value s\nathat is\nmuch greater than the actual stimulus value s. Because sa/greatermuchs, the average\n\ufb01ring rate of this neuron is essentially zero. For a Poisson distribution,\nzero rate implies zero variability. If, however, this neuron \ufb01res one or more\nspikes on a trial due to a non-Poisson source of variability, this will causea large error in the estimate because of the large weighting factor s\na.\nThe MAP estimation procedure is similar in spirit to the ML approach, but\nthe MAP estimate, sMAP, may differ from sMLif the probability density p[s]\ndepends on s. The MAP algorithm allows us to include prior knowledge\nabout the distribution of stimulus values into the decoding estimate. Asnoted above, if the p[s] is constant, the MAP and ML estimates are iden-\ntical. In addition, if many neurons are observed, or if a small number ofneurons is observed over a long trial period, even a non-constant stimulusdistribution has little effect and s\nMAP\u2248sML.\nThe MAP estimate is computed from the distribution p[s|r] determined by\nBayes theorem. In terms of the logarithms of the probabilities, ln p[s|r]=\nlnP[r|s]+lnp[s]\u2212lnP[r].

The dashed curve is for a Gaussian prior distribution with a\nmean of \u22122 and variance of 1, again with the true stimulus being s=0. The peak\nof the solid and dashed curves are at 0 .0385 and \u22120.107 respectively.\nFigure 3.10 compares the conditional stimulus probability densities p[s|r]\nfor a constant stimulus distribution (solid curve) and for a Gaussian stim-ulus distribution with s\nprior=\u22122 and \u03c3prior=1, using the \ufb01ring rates given\nby the \ufb01lled circles in \ufb01gure 3.9. If the stimulus distribution is constant,\np[s|r] is peaked near the true stimulus value of zero. The effect of a non-\nconstant stimulus distribution is to shift the curve toward the value \u22122\nwhere the stimulus probability density has its maximum, and to decreaseits width by a small amount. The estimate is shifted to the left becausethe prior distribution suggests that the stimulus is more likely to takenegative values than positive ones, independent of the evoked response.The decreased width is due to the added information that the prior dis-tribution provides. The curves in \ufb01gure 3.10 can be computed from equa-\ntions 3.27 and 3.34 as Gaussians with variances 1\n/(T/summationtextra/\u03c32\na)(constant\nprior) and 1 /(T/summationtextra/\u03c32\na+1/\u03c32\nprior)(Gaussian prior).\nThe accuracy with which an estimate sestdescribes a stimulus scan be\ncharacterized by two important quantities; its bias best(s)and its variance bias\n\u03c32\nest(s). The bias is the difference between the average of sestacross trials\nthat use the stimulus sand the true value of the stimulus, namely s,\nbest(s)=/angbracketleftsest/angbracketright\u2212s. (3.37)\nNote that the bias depends on the true value of the stimulus. An estimate\nis termed unbiased if best(s)=0 for all stimulus values.\nThe variance of the estimator, which quanti \ufb01es how much the estimate\nvaries about its mean value, is de \ufb01ned as variance\n\u03c32\nest(s)=/angbracketleft(sest\u2212/angbracketleftsest/angbracketright)2/angbracketright. (3.38)\nThe bias and variance together can be used to compute the trial-average\nsquared estimation error ,/angbracketleftbig(sest\u2212s)2/angbracketrightbig\n. This is measure of the spread of\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.3 Population Decoding 23\nthe estimated values about the true value of the stimulus. Because s=\n/angbracketleftsest/angbracketright+best(s), we can write the squared estimation error as estimation error\n/angbracketleftbig(sest\u2212s)2/angbracketrightbig=/angbracketleftbig(sest\u2212/angbracketleftsest/angbracketright\u2212best(s))2/angbracketrightbig=\u03c32\nest(s)+b2\nest(s). (3.39)\nIn other words, the average squared estimation error is the sum of the\nvariance and the square of the bias. For an unbiased estimate, the averagesquared estimation error is equal to the variance of the estimator.\nFisher Information\nDecoding can be used to limit the accuracy with which a neural systemencodes the value of a stimulus parameter because the encoding accuracycannot exceed the accuracy of an optimal decoding method. Of course, wemust be sure that the decoding technique used to establish such a boundis truly optimal, or else the result will re \ufb02ect the limitations of the decod-\ning procedure, not bounds on the neural system being studied. The Fisherinformation is a quantity that provides one such measure of encoding ac-curacy. Through a bound known as the Cram \u00b4er-Rao bound, the Fisher\ninformation limits the accuracy with which any decoding scheme can ex-tract an estimate of an encoded quantity.\nThe Cram \u00b4er-Rao bound limits the variance of any estimate s\nestaccording Cram\u00b4 er-Rao bound\nto (appendix B)\n\u03c32\nest(s)\u2265/parenleftbig\n1+b/prime\nest(s)/parenrightbig2\nIF(s)(3.40)\nwhere b/prime\nest(s)is the derivative of best(s). If we assume here that the \ufb01r-\ning rates take continuous values and that their distribution in responseto a stimulus sis described by the conditional probability density p[r\n|s],\nthe quantity IF(s)is the Fisher information of the \ufb01ring-rate distribution,\nwhich is related to p[r|s] (assuming the latter is suf \ufb01ciently smooth) by Fisher information\nIF(s)=/angbracketleftbigg\n\u2212\u22022lnp[r|s]\n\u2202s2/angbracketrightbigg\n=/integraldisplay\ndrp[r|s]/parenleftbigg\n\u2212\u22022lnp[r|s]\n\u2202s2/parenrightbigg\n.

(3.42)\nThe Cram \u00b4er-Rao bound sets a limit on the accuracy of any unbiased es-\ntimate of the stimulus. When best(s)=0, equation 3.39 indicates that the\naverage squared estimation error is equal to \u03c32\nestand, by equation 3.40, this\nsatis\ufb01es the bound \u03c32\nest\u22651/IF(s). Provided that we restrict ourselves to\nunbiased decoding schemes, the Fisher information sets an absolute limit\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n24 Neural Decoding\non decoding accuracy, and it thus provides a useful limit on encoding ac-\ncuracy. Although imposing zero bias on the decoding estimate seems rea-sonable, the restriction is not trivial. In general, minimizing the decodingerror in equation 3.39 involves a trade-off between minimizing the biasand the variance of the estimator. In some cases, biased schemes may pro-duce more accurate results than unbiased ones. For a biased estimator, theaverage squared estimation error and the variance of the estimate are notequal, and the estimation error can be either larger or smaller than 1\n/IF(s).\nThe limit on decoding accuracy set by the Fisher information can be at-\ntained by a decoding scheme we have studied, the maximum likelihoodmethod. In the limit of large numbers of encoding neurons ( N\n\u2192\u221e ),\nand for most \ufb01ring rate distributions, the ML estimate satis \ufb01es a number\nof desirable properties. First, it is asymptotically consistent, in the sense asymptotic\nconsistency that P[|sML\u2212s|>/epsilon1]\u21920 for any /epsilon1>0; it is also unbiased and saturates\nthe Cram \u00b4er-Rao bound. In other words, the variance of the ML estimate\nis given asymptotically (for large N)b y\u03c32\nML(s)=1/IF(s). Any unbiased\nestimator that saturates the Cram \u00b4er-Rao lower bound is called ef \ufb01cient. ef\ufb01ciency\nFurthermore, IF(s)grows linearly with N, and the ML estimate obeys a\ncentral limit theorem, so that N1/2(sML\u2212s)is Gaussian distributed with a\nvariance that is independent of Nin the large Nlimit.\nAs equation 3.41 shows, the Fisher information is a measure of the ex-\npected curvature of the log likelihood at the stimulus value s.C u r v a t u r e\nis important because the likelihood is expected to be at a maximum nearto the true stimulus value sthat caused the responses. If the likelihood\nis very curved and thus the Fisher information is large, typical responsesto the stimulus sare much less likely for other slightly different stimuli.\nTherefore, the typical response provides a strong indication of the value ofthe stimulus. If the likelihood is fairly \ufb02at and thus the Fisher information\nis small, typical responses to sare likely to occur for slightly different stim-\nuli as well. Thus, the response does not as clearly determine the stimulusvalue. The Fisher information is purely local in the sense that it does notre\ufb02ect the existence of stimulus values completely different from sthat are\nlikely to evoke the same responses as those evoked by sitself. However,\nthis does not happen for the sort of simple population codes we consider.Shannon\u2019s mutual information measure, discussed in chapter 4, takes suchpossibilities into account.\nThe Fisher information for a population of neurons with uniformly ar-\nrayed tuning curves (the Gaussian array in \ufb01gure 3.8, for example) and\nPoisson statistics can be computed from the conditional \ufb01ring-rate proba-\nbility in equation 3.30. Because the spike-count rate is described here by aprobability rather than a probability density, we use the discrete analog ofequation 3.41,\nI\nF(s)=/angbracketleftbigg\n\u2212d2lnP[r|s]\nds2/angbracketrightbigg\n=TN/summationdisplay\na=1/angbracketleftra/angbracketright/parenleftBigg/parenleftbiggf/prime\na(s)\nfa(s)/parenrightbigg2\n\u2212f/prime/prime\na(s)\nfa(s)/parenrightBigg\n.

(3.44)\nIn this expression, each neuron contributes an amount to the Fisher infor-\nmation proportional to the square of its tuning curve slope and inverselyproportional to the average \ufb01ring rate for the particular stimulus value be-\ning estimated. Highly sloped tuning curves give \ufb01ring rates that are sensi-\ntive to the precise value of the stimulus. Figure 3.11 shows the contributionto the sum in equation 3.44 from a single neuron with a Gaussian tuningcurve, the neuron with s\na=0i n\ufb01gure 3.8. For comparison purposes, a\ndashed curve proportional to the tuning curve is also plotted. Note thatthe Fisher information vanishes for the stimulus value that produces themaximum average \ufb01ring rate, because f\n/prime\na(s)=0 at this point. The \ufb01ring\nrate of a neuron at the peak of its tuning curve is relatively unaffected bysmall changes in the stimulus. Individual neurons carry the most Fisherinformation in regions of their tuning curves where average \ufb01ring rates\nare rapidly varying functions of the stimulus value, not where the \ufb01ring\nrate is highest.\nThe Fisher information can be used to derive an interesting result on the\noptimal widths of response tuning curves (Zhang and Sejnowski, 1998).Consider a population of neurons with tuning curves of identical shapes,distributed evenly over a range of stimulus values as in \ufb01gure 3.8. Equa-\ntion 3.44 indicates that the Fisher information will be largest if the tuningcurves of individual neurons are rapidly varying (making the square oftheir derivatives large), and if many neurons respond (making the sumover neurons large). For typical neuronal response tuning curves, these\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Neural Decoding\ntwo requirements are in con \ufb02ict with each other. If the population of neu-\nrons has narrow tuning curves, individual neural responses are rapidlyvarying functions of the stimulus, but few neurons response. Broad tun-ing curves allow many neurons to respond, but the individual responsesare not as sensitive to the stimulus value. To determine whether narrow orbroad tuning curves produce the most accurate encodings, we consider adense distribution of Gaussian tuning curves, all with\n\u03c3a=\u03c3r.

(3.45)\nThis expression can be approximated by replacing the sum over neurons\nby an integral over their preferred stimulus values and multiplying by a sums\u2192integrals\ndensity factor \u03c1s. The factor \u03c1sis the density with which the neurons cover\nthe range of stimulus values, and it is equal to the number of neurons withpreferred stimulus values lying within a unit range of svalues.

(3.46)\nWe have expressed the \ufb01nal result in this form because the number of neu-\nrons that respond to a given stimulus value is roughly \u03c1s\u03c3r, and the Fisher\ninformation is proportional to this number divided by the square of thetuning curve width. Combining these factors, the Fisher information is in-versely proportional to\n\u03c3r, and the encoding accuracy increases with nar-\nrower tuning curve widths.\nThe advantage of using narrow tuning curves goes away if the stimulus\nis characterized by more than one parameter. Consider a stimulus with\nDparameters and suppose that the response tuning curves are products\nof identical Gaussians for each of these parameters. If the tuning curvescover the D-dimensional space of stimulus values with a uniform density\n\u03c1s, the number of responding neurons for any stimulus value is propor-\ntional to \u03c1s\u03c3D\nrand, using the same integral approximation as in equation\n3.46, the Fisher information is\nIF=(2\u03c0)D/2D\u03c1s\u03c3D\nrrmaxT\n\u03c32r=(2\u03c0)D/2D\u03c1s\u03c3D\u22122\nrrmaxT. (3.47)\nThis equation, which reduces to the result given above if D=1, allows us\nto examine the effect tuning curve width on encoding accuracy. The trade-off between the encoding accuracy of individual neurons and the numberof responding neurons depends on the dimension of the stimulus space.Narrowing the tuning curves (making\n\u03c3rsmaller) increases the Fisher in-\nformation for D=1, decreases it for D>2, and has no impact if D=2.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.4 Spike Train Decoding 27\nOptimal Discrimination\nIn the \ufb01rst part of this chapter, we considered discrimination between two\nvalues of a stimulus. An alternative to the procedures discussed there issimply to decode the responses and discriminate on the basis of the es-timated stimulus values. Consider the case of discriminating between s\nand s\n+/Delta1sfor small /Delta1s. For large N, the average value of the difference\nbetween the ML estimates for the two stimulus values is equal to /Delta1s(be-\ncause the estimate is unbiased) and the variance of each estimate (for small\n/Delta1s)i s1/IF(s). Thus, the discriminability, de \ufb01ned in equation 3.4, for the ML\ndiscriminability ML based test is\nd/prime=/Delta1s/radicalbig\nIF(s). (3.48)\nThe larger the Fisher information, the higher the discriminability. We leave\nas an exercise the proof that for small /Delta1s, this discriminability is the same\nas that of the likelihood ratio test Z(r)de\ufb01ned in equation 3.18.\nDiscrimination by ML estimation requires maximizing the likelihood, and\nthis may be computationally challenging. The likelihood ratio test de-scribed previously may be simpler, especially for Poisson variability, be-cause, for small\n/Delta1s, the likelihood ratio test Zde\ufb01ned in equation 3.18 is a\nlinear function of the \ufb01ring rates,\nZ=TN/summationdisplay\na=1raf/prime\na(s)\nfa(s). (3.49)\nFigure 3.12 shows an interesting comparison of the Fisher information\nfor orientation tuning in the primary visual cortex with human orienta-tion discrimination thresholds. Agreement like this can occur for dif \ufb01cult\ntasks, like discrimination at threshold, where the performance of a subjectmay be limited by basic constraints on neuronal encoding accuracy.\n3.4 Spike Train Decoding\nThe decoding methods we have considered estimate or discriminate staticstimulus values on the basis of spike-count \ufb01ring rates. Spike-count \ufb01ring\nrates do not provide suf \ufb01cient information for reconstructing a stimulus\nthat varies during the course of a trial. Instead, we can estimate such astimulus from the sequence of \ufb01ring times t\nifori=1,2,..., nof the spikes\nthat it evokes. One method for doing this is similar to the Wiener kernelapproach used to estimate the \ufb01ring rate from the stimulus in chapter 2,\nand to the approximation of a \ufb01ring rate using a sliding window function\nintroduced in chapter 1. For simplicity, we restrict our discussion to thedecoding of a single neuron. We assume, as we did in chapter 2, that thetime average of the stimulus being estimated is zero.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Neural Decoding\n0 1000 2000 30000510\nNorientation threshold\n   or ( IF)-1/2 (degrees)\nFigure 3.12: Comparison of Fisher information and discrimination thresholds for\norientation tuning.

(Adapted from Paradiso, 1988.)\nIn spike train decoding, we attempt to construct an estimate of the stim-\nulus at time tfrom the sequence of spikes evoked up to that time. There\nare paradoxical aspects of this procedure. The \ufb01ring of an action potential\nat time tiis only affected by the stimulus s(t)prior to that time, t<ti, and\nyet, in spike decoding, we attempt to extract information from this actionpotential about the value of the stimulus at a later time t\n>ti. That is,\nthe evoked spikes tell us about the past behavior of the stimulus and, inspike decoding, we attempt to use this information to predict the currentstimulus value. Clearly, this requires that the stimulus have some formof temporal correlation so that past behavior provides information aboutthe current stimulus value. To make the decoding task easier, we can intro-duce a prediction delay,\n\u03c40, and attempt to construct from spikes occurring prediction delay \u03c40\nprior to time t, an estimate of the stimulus at time t\u2212\u03c40(see\ufb01gure 3.13A).\nSuch a delayed estimate uses a combination of spikes that could have been\ufb01red in response to the stimulus s\n(t\u2212\u03c40)being estimated (those for which\nt\u2212\u03c40<ti<t;s p i k e7i n \ufb01gure 3.13A), and spikes that occured too early\nto be affected by the value of s(t\u2212\u03c40)(those for which ti<t\u2212\u03c40;s p i k e s\n1-6 in \ufb01gure 3.13A), but that can contribute to its estimation on the basis\nof stimulus correlations. The estimation task gets easier as \u03c40is increased,\nbut this delays the decoding and makes the result less behaviorally rele-vant. We will consider decoding with an arbitrary delay and later discusshow to set a speci \ufb01c value for\n\u03c40.\nThe stimulus estimate is constructed as a linear sum over all spikes.

(3.55)\nAt this point in the derivation of the optimal linear kernel for \ufb01ring-rate\nprediction in chapter 2, we chose the stimulus to be uncorrelated so thatan integral equation similar to 3.53 simpli \ufb01ed. This could always be done\nbecause we have complete control over the stimulus in this type of exper-iment. However, we do not have similar control of the neuron, and mustdeal with whatever spike train autocorrelation function it gives us. If thespike train is uncorrelated, which tends to happen at low rates,\nQ\n\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c4)=/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u03b4(\u03c4), (3.56)\nand we \ufb01nd from equation 3.53 that\nK(\u03c4)=1\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightQrs(\u03c4\u2212\u03c40)=C(\u03c40\u2212\u03c4)=1\n/angbracketleftn/angbracketright/angbracketleftBiggn/summationdisplay\ni=1s(ti+\u03c4\u2212\u03c40)/angbracketrightBigg\n.(3.57)\nThis is the average value of the stimulus at time \u03c4\u2212\u03c40relative to the ap-\npearance of a spike. Because \u03c4\u2212\u03c40can be either positive or negative,\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.4 Spike Train Decoding 31\nstimulus estimation, unlike \ufb01ring rate estimation, involves both forward\nand backward correlation and the average values of the stimulus both be-fore and after a spike. Decoding in this way follows a simple rule; everytime a spike appears, we replace it with the average stimulus surroundinga spike, shifted by an amount\n\u03c40(\ufb01gure 3.13).\nThe need for either stimulus correlations or a nonzero prediction delay is\nclear from equation 3.57. Correlations between a spike and subsequentstimuli can only arise, in a causal system, from correlations between thestimulus and itself. If these are absent, as for white noise, K\n(\u03c4)will be\nzero for \u03c4>\u03c4 0. For causal decoding, we must also have K(\u03c4)=0f o r\u03c4<0.\nThus, if \u03c40=0 and the stimulus is uncorrelated, K(\u03c4)=0 for all values of\n\u03c4.\nWhen the spike train autocorrelation function is not a \u03b4function, the solu-\ntion for Kcan be expressed as an inverse Fourier transform, optimal kernel\nK(\u03c4)=1\n2\u03c0/integraldisplay\nd\u03c9\u02dcK(\u03c9)exp(\u2212i\u03c9\u03c4) (3.58)\nwhere, as shown in appendix C,\n\u02dcK(\u03c9)=\u02dcQrs(\u03c9)exp(i\u03c9\u03c40)\n\u02dcQ\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c9). (3.59)\nHere \u02dcQrsand\u02dcQ\u03c1\u03c1are the Fourier transforms of Qrsand Q\u03c1\u03c1. The numer-\nator in this expression reproduces the expression Qrs(\u03c4\u2212\u03c40)in equation\n3.57. The role of the denominator is to correct for any autocorrelations inthe response spike train. Such correlations introduce a bias in the decod-ing, and the denominator in equation 3.59 corrects for this bias.\nIf we ignore the constraint of causality, then, because the occurrence of\na spike cannot depend on the behavior of a stimulus in the very distantpast, we can expect K\n(\u03c4)from equation 3.57 or 3.58 and 3.59 to vanish for\nsuf\ufb01ciently negative values of \u03c4\u2212\u03c40. For most neurons, this will occur for\n\u03c4\u2212\u03c40more negative than minus a few hundred ms. The decoding kernel\ngiven by equation 3.57 can therefore be made small for negative values of \u03c4\nby choosing \u03c40large enough, but this may require a fairly large prediction\ndelay. We can force exact adherence to the causality constaint for \u03c4<0b y causality constraint\nreplacing K(\u03c4)by/Theta1(\u03c4) K(\u03c4)where /Theta1(\u03c4) is de\ufb01ned such that /Theta1(\u03c4)=1f o r\n\u03c4>0 and /Theta1(\u03c4)=0f o r\u03c4<0. The causality constraint was imposed in this\nway in \ufb01gure 3.13B. When it is multiplied by /Theta1(\u03c4) , the restricted Kis no\nlonger the optimal decoding kernel, but it may be close to optimal.\nAnother way of imposing causality on the decoding kernel is to expand\nK(\u03c4)as a weighted sum of causal basis functions (functions that vanish for\nnegative arguments and span the space of functions satisfying the causalconstraint). The optimal weights are then determined by minimizing theestimation error. This approach has the advantage of producing a trulyoptimal kernel for any desired value of\n\u03c40.

Finally, the optimal causalkernel, also called the Wiener-Hopf \ufb01lter, can be obtained by a technique\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n3.5 Chapter Summary 33\nthat involves so-called spectral factorization of \u02dcQ\u03c1\u03c1(\u03c9).\nFigure 3.14 shows an example of spike train decoding for the H1 neuron of\nthe\ufb02y discussed in chapter 2. The top panel gives two reconstruction ker-\nnels, one acausal and one causal, that can be used in the decoding, and thebottom panel compares the reconstructed stimulus velocity with the actualstimulus velocity. The middle panel in \ufb01gure 3.14 points out one further\nwrinkle in the procedure. Flies have two H1 neurons, one on each side ofthe body, that respond to motion in opposite directions. As is often thecase, half-wave recti \ufb01cation prevents a single neuron from encoding both\ndirections of motion. In the experiment described in the \ufb01gure, rather than\nrecording from both H1 neurons, Bialek et al. (1991) recorded from a singleH1 neuron, but presented both the stimulus s\n(t)and its negative, \u2212s(t).\nThe two rows of spikes in the middle panel show sample traces for each ofthese presentations. This procedure provides a reasonable approximationof recording both H1 neurons, and produces a neuron/anti-neuron pairof recordings similar to the one that we discussed in connection with mo-tion discrimination from area MT neurons. The stimulus is then decodedby summing the kernel K\n(t\u2212ti)for all spike times tiof the recorded H1\nneuron and summing \u2212K(t\u2212tj)for all spike times tjof its anti-neuron\npartner.\nThe\ufb02y only has two H1 neurons from which it must extract information\nabout visual motion, so it seems reasonable that stimulus reconstructionusing the spike-train decoding technique can produce quite accurate re-sults ( \ufb01gure 3.14). It is perhaps more surprising that accurate decoding, at\nleast in the sense of percent correct, can be obtained from single neuronsout of the large population of MT neurons responding to visual motionin the monkey. Of course, the reconstruction of a time-dependent stim-ulus from H1 responses is more challenging than the binary discrimina-tion done with MT neurons. Furthermore, it is worth remembering that inall the examples we have considered, including decoding wind directionfrom the cercal system and arm movement direction from a population ofM1 neurons, the stimuli used are extremely simple compared to the natu-rally occurring stimuli that must be interpreted during normal behavior.\n3.5 Chapter Summary\nWe have considered the decoding of stimulus characteristics from the re-sponses they evoke, including discrimination between stimulus values,the decoding of static stimuli on the basis of population responses, andthe decoding of dynamic stimulus parameters from spike trains. Discrim-ination was studied using the receiver operating characteristic, likelihoodratio tests, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma. For static parameter decod-ing we introduced the vector method, Bayesian, maximum a posteriori and\nmaximum likelihood inference, the Fisher information and the Cram \u00b4er-\nRao lower bound. We also showed how to use ideas from Wiener \ufb01ltering\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Neural Decoding\nto reconstruct an approximation to a time-varying stimulus from the spike\ntrains it evokes.\n3.6 Appendices\nA) The Neyman-Pearson Lemma\nConsider the difference /Delta1\u03b2in the power of two tests that have identical\nsizes\u03b1.

Var-ious theoretical aspects of population decoding such as vector and MLdecoding and the Fisher information that comprise our account were de-veloped by Paradiso (1988); Baldi and Heiligenberg (1988); Vogels (1990),Snippe & Koenderink (1992); Zohary (1992), Seung & Sompolinsky (1993);Touretzky et al.

Zhang & Sejnowski (1999) treat theeffect of narrowing or broadening tuning curves on the Fisher informa-tion. Population codes are also known as coarse codes in the connectionistliterature (Hinton, 1981).\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\nChapter 4\nInformation Theory\n4.1 Entropy and Mutual Information\nNeural encoding and decoding focus on the question: \u201dWhat does the re-\nsponse of a neuron tell us about a stimulus\u201d. In this chapter we considera related but different question: \u201dHow much does the neural response tellus about a stimulus\u201d. The techniques of information theory allow us toanswer this question in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, we can usethem to ask what forms of neural response are optimal for conveying in-formation about natural stimuli.\nShannon invented information theory as a general framework for quan-\ntifying the ability of a coding scheme or a communication channel (suchas the optic nerve) to convey information. It is assumed that the code in-volves a number of symbols (such as neuronal responses), and that thecoding and transmission processes are stochastic and noisy. The quanti-ties we consider in this chapter, the entropy and the mutual information,depend on the probabilities with which these symbols, or combinationsof them, are used. Entropy is a measure of the theoretical capacity of acode to convey information. Mutual information measures how much ofthat capacity is actually used when the code is employed to describe a par-ticular set of data. Communication channels, if they are noisy, have onlylimited capacities to convey information. The techniques of informationtheory are used to evaluate these limits and \ufb01nd coding schemes that sat-\nurate them.\nIn neuroscience applications, the symbols we consider are neuronal re-\nsponses, and the data sets they describe are stimulus characteristics. In themost complete analyses, which are considered at the end of the chapter, theneuronal response is characterized by a list of action potential \ufb01ring times.\nThe symbols being analyzed in this case are sequences of action potentials.Computing the entropy and mutual information for spike sequences can\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Information Theory\nbe dif \ufb01cult because the frequency of occurrence of many different spike\nsequences must be determined. This typically requires a large amount ofdata. For this reason, many information theory analyses use simpli \ufb01ed\ndescriptions of the response of a neuron that reduce the number of possi-ble \u2018symbols\u2019 (i.e. responses) that need to be considered. We discuss casesin which the symbols consist of responses described by spike-count \ufb01ring\nrates. We also consider the extension to continuous-valued \ufb01ring rates.\nBecause a reduced description of a spike train can carry no more informa-tion than the full spike train itself, this approach provides a lower boundon the actual information carried by the spike train.\nEntropy\nEntropy is a quantity that, roughly speaking, measures how \u2018interesting\u2019or \u2018surprising\u2019 a set of responses is. Suppose that we are given a set ofneural responses. If each response is identical, or if only a few differentresponses appear, we might conclude that this data set is relatively un-interesting. A more interesting set might show a larger range of differentresponses, perhaps in a highly irregular and unpredictable sequence. Howcan we quantify this intuitive notion of an interesting set of responses?\nWe begin by characterizing the responses in terms of their spike-count \ufb01r-\ning rates, i.e. the number of spikes divided by the trial duration, which cantake a discrete set of different values. The methods we discuss are basedon the probabilities P[r] of observing a response with a spike-count rate\nr. The most widely used measure of entropy, due to Shannon, expresses\nthe \u2018surprise\u2019 associated with seeing a response rate ras a function of the\nprobability of getting that response, h\n(P[r]), and quanti \ufb01es the entropy as\nthe average of h(P[r])over all possible responses. The function h(P[r]), surprise\nwhich acts as a measure of surprise, is chosen to satisfy a number of con-ditions. First, h\n(P[r])should be a decreasing function of P[r] because low\nprobability responses are more surprising than high probability responses.Further, the surprise measure for a response that consists of two indepen-dent spike counts should be the sum of the measures for each spike countseparately. This assures that the entropy and information measures weultimately obtain will be additive for independent sources. Suppose werecord rates r\n1and r2from two neurons that respond independently of\neach other. Because the responses are independent, the probability of get-ting this pair of responses is the product of their individual probabilities,\nP[r\n1]P[r2], so the additivity condition requires that\nh(P[r1]P[r2])=h(P[r1])+h(P[r2]). (4.1)\nThe logarithm is the only function that satis \ufb01es such an identity for all P.\nThus, it only remains to decide what base to use for the logarithm. By con-vention, base 2 logarithms are used so that information can be comparedeasily with results for binary systems. To indicate that the base 2 logarithm\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.1 Entropy and Mutual Information 3\nis being used, information is reported in units of \u2018bits\u2019, with\nh(P[r])=\u2212 log2P[r]. (4.2)\nThe minus sign makes ha decreasing function of its argument as required.\nNote that information is really a dimensionless number. The bit, like theradian for angles, is not a dimensional unit but a reminder that a particularsystem is being used.\nExpression (4.2) quanti \ufb01es the surprise or unpredictability associated with\na particular response. Shannon\u2019s entropy is just this measure averaged entropy\nover all responses\nH\n=\u2212/summationdisplay\nrP[r]l o g2P[r]. (4.3)\nIn the sum that determines the entropy, the factor h=\u2212 log2P[r] is mul-\ntiplied by the probability that the response with rate roccurs. Responses\nwith extremely low probabilities may contribute little to the total entropy,despite having large hvalues, because they occur so rarely. In the limit\nwhen P[r]\n\u21920,h\u2192\u221e , but an event that does not occur does not con-\ntribute to the entropy because the problematic expression \u22120l o g20 is eval-\nuated as \u2212/epsilon1log2/epsilon1in the limit /epsilon1\u21920 and is zero. Very high probability re-\nsponses also contribute little because they have h\u22480. The responses that\ncontribute most to the entropy have high enough probabilities so that theyappear with a fair frequency, but not high enough to make htoo small.\nComputing the entropy in some simple cases helps provide a feel for what\nit measures. First, imagine the least interesting situation, when a neuronresponds every time by \ufb01ring at the same rate. In this case, all of the prob-\nabilities P[r] are zero, except for one of them which is one. This means that\nevery term in the sum of equation (4.3) is zero because either P[r]\n=0o r\nlog21=0. Thus, a set of identical responses has zero entropy. Next, imag-\nine that the the neuron responds in only two possible ways, either withrate r\n+orr\u2212. In this case, there are only two nonzero terms in equation\n(4.3), and, using the fact that P[r\u2212]=1\u2212P[r+], the entropy is\nH=\u2212(1\u2212P[r+])log2(1\u2212P[r+])\u2212P[r+]l o g2P[r+]. (4.4)\nThis entropy, plotted in \ufb01gure 4.1A, takes its maximum value of one bit\nwhen P[r\u2212]=P[r+]=1/2. Thus, a code consisting of two equally likely\nresponses has one bit of entropy.\nMutual Information\nTo convey information about a set of stimuli, neural responses must bedifferent for different stimuli. Entropy is a measure of response variabil-ity, but it does not tell us anything about the source of that variability. Aneuron can only provide information about a stimulus if its response vari-ability is correlated with changes in that stimulus, rather than being purely\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Information Theory\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0H  (bits)\n1.00.80.60.40.20.0\nP [r+]1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0Im (bits)\n0.50.40.30.20.10.0\nPXA B\nFigure 4.1: A) The entropy of a binary code.

One way to determine\nwhether response variability is correlated with stimulus variability is tocompare the responses obtained using a different stimulus on every trialwith those measured in trials involving repeated presentations of the samestimulus. Responses that are informative about the identity of the stimu-lus should exhibit larger variability for trials involving different stimulithan for trials that use the same stimulus repetitively. Mutual informationis an entropy-based measure related to this idea.\nThe mutual information is the difference between the total response en-\ntropy and the average response entropy on trials that involve repetitivepresentation of the same stimulus. Subtracting the entropy when the stim-ulus does not change removes from the total entropy the contribution fromresponse variability that is not associated with the identity of the stimulus.When the responses are characterized by a spike-count rate, the total re-sponse entropy is given by equation 4.3. The entropy of the responsesevoked by repeated presentations of a given stimulus sis computed us-\ning the conditional probability P[r\n|s], the probability of a response at rate\nrgiven that stimulus swas presented, instead of the response probability\nP[r] in equation 4.3. The entropy of the responses to a given stimulus is\nthus\nHs=\u2212/summationdisplay\nrP[r|s]l o g2P[r|s]. (4.5)\nIf we average this quantity over all the stimuli, we obtain a quantity called\nthe noise entropy noise entropy\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(4.6)\nThis is the entropy associated with that part of the response variability that\nis not due to changes in the stimulus, but arises from other sources. Themutual information is obtained by subtracting the noise entropy from thefull response entropy, which from equations 4.3 and 4.6 gives mutual information\nI\nm=H\u2212Hnoise=\u2212/summationdisplay\nrP[r]l o g2P[r]+/summationdisplay\ns,rP[s]P[r|s]l o g2P[r|s].(4.7)\nThe probability of a response ris related to the conditional probability\nP[r|s] and the probability P[s] that stimulus sis presented by the identity\n(chapter 3)\nP[r]=/summationdisplay\nsP[s]P[r|s]. (4.8)\nUsing this, and writing the difference of the two logarithms in equation 4.7\nas the logarithm of the ratio of their arguments, we can rewrite the mutualinformation as\nI\nm=/summationdisplay\ns,rP[s]P[r|s]l o g2/parenleftbiggP[r|s]\nP[r]/parenrightbigg\n. (4.9)\nRecall from chapter 3 that,\nP[r,s]=P[s]P[r|s]=P[r]P[s|r] (4.10)\nwhere P[r,s] is the joint probability of stimulus sappearing and response\nrbeing evoked. Equation 4.10 can be used to derive yet another form for\nthe mutual information\nIm=/summationdisplay\ns,rP[r,s]l o g2/parenleftbiggP[r,s]\nP[r]P[s]/parenrightbigg\n. (4.11)\nThis equation reveals that the mutual information is symmetric with re-\nspect to interchange of sand r, which means that the mutual information\nthat a set of responses conveys about a set of stimuli is identical to the mu-tual information that the set of stimuli conveys about the responses. To seethis explicitly, we apply equation 4.10 again to write\nI\nm=\u2212/summationdisplay\nsP[s] log2P[s]+/summationdisplay\ns,rP[r]P[s|r]l o g2P[s|r]. (4.12)\nThis result is the same as equation 4.7 except that the roles of the stimu-\nlus and the response have been interchanged. Equation 4.12 shows howresponse variability limits the ability of a spike train to carry information.The second term on the right side, which is negative, is the average uncer-tainty about the identity of the stimulus given the response, and reducesthe total stimulus entropy represented by the \ufb01rst term.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Information Theory\nTo provide some concrete examples, we compute the mutual information\nfor a few simple cases. First, suppose that the responses of the neuronare completely unaffected by the identity of the stimulus. In this case,\nP[r\n|s]=P[r], and from equation 4.9 it follows immediately that Im=0. At\nthe other extreme, suppose that each stimulus sproduces a unique and\ndistinct response rs. Then, P[rs]=P[s] and P[r|s]=1i fr=rsand P[r|s]=0\notherwise. This causes the sum over rin equation 4.9 to collapse to just\none term, and the mutual information becomes\nIm=/summationdisplay\nsP[s]l o g2/parenleftbigg1\nP[rs]/parenrightbigg\n=\u2212/summationdisplay\nsP[s]l o g2P[s]. (4.13)\nThe last expression, which follows from the fact that P[rs]=P[s], is the en-\ntropy of the stimulus. Thus, with no variability and a one-to-one map fromstimulus to response, the mutual information is equal to the full stimulusentropy.\nFinally, imagine that there are only two possible stimulus values, which\nwe label\n+and\u2212, and that the neuron responds with just two rates, r+and\nr\u2212. We associate the response r+with the +stimulus, and the response r\u2212\nwith the \u2212stimulus, but the encoding is not perfect. The probability of an\nincorrect response is PX, meaning that for the correct responses P[r+|+]=\nP[r\u2212|\u2212]=1\u2212PX, and for the incorrect responses P[r+|\u2212]=P[r\u2212|+]=PX.\nWe assume that the two stimuli are presented with equal probability sothat P[r\n+]=P[r\u2212]=1/2 which, from equation 4.4, makes the full response\nentropy one bit. The noise entropy is \u2212(1\u2212PX)log2(1\u2212PX)\u2212PXlog2PX.\nThus, the mutual information is\nIm=1+(1\u2212PX)log2(1\u2212PX)+PXlog2PX. (4.14)\nThis is plotted in \ufb01gure 4.1B. When the encoding is error free ( PX=0),\nthe mutual information is one bit, which is equal to both the full responseentropy and the stimulus entropy. When the encoding is random ( P\nX=\n1/2), the mutual information goes to zero.\nIt is instructive to consider this example from the perspective of decoding.\nWe can think of the neuron as being a communication channel that reportsnoisily on the stimulus. From this perspective, we want to know the prob-ability that a\n+was presented given that the response r+was recorded. By\nBayes theorem, this is P[+|r+]=P[r+|+]P[+]/P[r+]=1\u2212PX. Before the\nresponse is recorded, the prior expectation was that +and\u2212were equally\nlikely. If the response r+is recorded, this expectation changes to 1 \u2212PX.\nThe mutual information measures the corresponding reduction in uncer-tainty, or equivalently, the tightening of the posterior distribution due tothe response.\nThe mutual information is related to a measure used in statistics called\nthe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence between one KL divergence\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.1 Entropy and Mutual Information 7\nprobability distribution P[r] and another distribution Q[r]i s\nDKL(P,Q)=/summationdisplay\nrP[r] log2/parenleftbiggP[r]\nQ[r]/parenrightbigg\n. (4.15)\nThe KL divergence has a property normally associated with a distance\nmeasure, DKL(P,Q)\u22650 with equality if and only if P=Q(proven in ap-\npendix A). However, unlike a distance, it is not symmetric with respect tointerchange of Pand Q. Comparing the de \ufb01nition 4.15 with equation 4.11,\nwe see that the mutual information is the KL divergence between the dis-tributions P[r\n,s] and P[r]P[s]. If the stimulus and the response were inde-\npendent of each other, P[r,s] would be equal to P[r]P[s]. Thus, the mutual\ninformation is the KL divergence between the actual probability distribu-tion P[r\n,s], and the value it would take if the stimulus and response were\nindependent. The fact that DKL\u22650 proves that the mutual information\ncannot be negative. In addition, it can never be larger than either the fullresponse entropy or the entropy of the stimulus set.\nEntropy and Mutual Information for Continuous Variables\nUp to now we have characterized neural responses using discrete spike-count rates. As in chapter 3, it is often convenient to treat these rates in-stead as continuous variables. There is a complication associated with en-tropies that are de \ufb01ned in terms of continuous response variables. If we\ncould measure the value of a continuously de \ufb01ned\ufb01ring rate with unlim-\nited accuracy, it would be possible to convey an in \ufb01nite amount of infor-\nmation using the endless sequence of decimal digits of this single variable.Of course, practical considerations always limit the accuracy with which a\ufb01ring rate can be measured or conveyed.\nTo de \ufb01ne the entropy associated with a continuous measure of a neural\nresponse, we must include some limit on the measurement accuracy. Theeffects of this limit typically cancel in computations of mutual informationbecause these involve taking differences between two entropies. In thissection, we show how entropy and mutual information are computed forresponses characterized by continuous \ufb01ring rates. For completeness, we\nalso treat the stimulus parameter sas a continuous variable. This means\nthat the probability P[s] is replaced by the probability density p[s], and\nsums over sare replaced by integrals.\nFor a continuously de \ufb01ned\ufb01ring rate, the probability of the \ufb01ring rate\nlying in the range between rand r\n+/Delta1r, for small /Delta1r, is expressed in terms\nof a probability density as p[r]/Delta1r. Summing over discrete bins of size /Delta1r\nwe\ufb01nd, by analogy with equation (4.3),\nH=\u2212/summationdisplay\np[r]/Delta1rlog2(p[r]/Delta1r) (4.16)\n=\u2212/summationdisplay\np[r]/Delta1rlog2p[r]\u2212log2/Delta1r.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Information Theory\nTo extract the last term we have expressed the logarithm of a product as\nthe sum of two logarithms and used the fact the the sum of the responseprobabilities is one. We would now like to take the limit\n/Delta1r\u21920 but we\ncannot because the log2/Delta1rterm diverges in this limit. This divergence\nre\ufb02ects the fact that a continuous variable measured with perfect accuracy\nhas in \ufb01nite entropy. However, for reasonable (i.e. Riemann integrable)\np[r], everything works out \ufb01ne for the \ufb01rst term because the sum becomes\nan integral in the limit /Delta1r\u21920. In this limit, we can write continuous entropy\nlim\n/Delta1r\u21920/braceleftbig\nH+log2/Delta1r/bracerightbig=\u2212/integraldisplay\ndr p[r]l o g2p[r]. (4.17)\n/Delta1ris best thought of as a limit on the resolution with which the \ufb01ring\nrate can be measured. Unless this limit is known, the entropy of a prob-ability density for a continuous variable can only be determined up to anadditive constant. However, if two entropies computed with the same res-olution are subtracted, the troublesome term involving\n/Delta1rcancels and we\ncan proceed without knowing its precise value. All of the cases where weuse equation 4.17 are of this form. The integral on the right side of equa-tion 4.17 is sometimes called the differential entropy.\nThe noise entropy, for a continuous variable like the \ufb01ring rate, can be\nwritten in a manner similar to the response entropy 4.17, except that theconditional probability density p[r\n|s]i su s e d continuous noise\nentropy\nlim\n/Delta1r\u21920/braceleftbig\nHnoise+log2/Delta1r/bracerightbig=\u2212/integraldisplay\nds/integraldisplay\ndr p[s]p[r|s]l o g2p[r|s].

(4.19)\nNote that the factor of log2/Delta1rhas canceled in the expression for the mu-\ntual information because both entropies were evaluated at the same reso-lution.\nIn chapter 3, we described the Fisher information as a local measure of\nhow tightly the responses determine the stimulus. The Fisher informa-tion is local because it depends on the expected curvature of the likelihood\nP[r\n|s] (typically for the responses of many cells) evaluated at the true stim-\nulus value. The mutual information is a global measure in the sense thatit depends on the average overall uncertainty in the decoding distribution\nP[s\n|r], including values of sboth close and far from the true stimulus. If\nthe decoding distribution P[s|r] has a single peak about the true stimulus,\nthe Fisher information and the mutual information are closely related. Inparticular, for large numbers of neurons, the maximum likelihood estima-tor tends to have a Gaussian distribution, as discussed in chapter 3. In thiscase, the mutual information between stimulus and response is essentially,up to an additive constant, the logarithm of the Fisher information.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.2 Information and Entropy Maximization 9\n4.2 Information and Entropy Maximization\nEntropy and mutual information are useful quantities for characterizing\nthe nature and ef \ufb01ciency of neural encoding and selectivity. Often, in ad-\ndition to such characterizations, we seek to understand the computationalimplications of an observed response selectivity. For example, we mightask whether neural responses to natural stimuli are optimized to convey asmuch information as possible. This hypothesis can be tested by computingthe response characteristics that maximize the mutual information con-veyed about naturally occurring stimuli and comparing the results withresponses observed experimentally.\nBecause the mutual information is the full response entropy minus the\nnoise entropy, maximizing the information involves a compromise. Wemust make the response entropy as large as possible without allowing thenoise entropy to get too big. If the noise entropy is small, which meansthat the mutual information is limited by the resolution with which theresponse can be read out rather than by extraneous sources of noise, max-imizing the response entropy, subject to an appropriate constraint, maxi-mizes the mutual information to a good approximation. We therefore be-gin our discussion by studying how response entropy can be maximized.Later in the discussion, we will consider the effects of noise entropy.\nConstraints play a crucial role in this analysis. We have already seen that\nthe theoretical information carrying capacity associated with a continuous\ufb01ring rate is limited only by the resolution with which the \ufb01ring rate can be\nde\ufb01ned. Even with a \ufb01nite resolution, a \ufb01ring rate could convey an in \ufb01nite\namount of information if it could take arbitrarily high values. Thus, wemust impose some constraint that limits the \ufb01ring rate to a realistic range.\nPossible constraints include limiting the maximum allowed \ufb01ring rate or\nholding the average \ufb01ring rate or its variance \ufb01xed.\nEntropy Maximization for a Single Neuron\nTo maximize the response entropy we must \ufb01nd a probability density p[r]\nthat makes the integral in equation 4.17 as large as possible while satis-fying whatever constraints we impose. During the maximization process,the resolution\n/Delta1ris held \ufb01xed, so the log2/Delta1rterm remains constant, and\nit can be ignored. As a result, it will not generally appear in the followingequations. One constraint that always applies in entropy maximization isthat the integral of the probability density must be one. Suppose that theneuron in question has a maximum \ufb01ring rate of r\nmax. Then, the integrals\nin question extend from 0 to rmax.T o\ufb01nd the p[r] producing the maximum\nentropy, we must maximize\n\u2212/integraldisplayrmax\n0dr p[r]l o g2p[r] (4.20)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Information Theory\nsubject to the constraint\n/integraldisplayrmax\n0dr p[r]=1. (4.21)\nThe result is that the probability density that maximizes the entropy sub-\nject to this constraint is a constant,\np[r]=1\nrmax, (4.22)\nindependent of r. The entropy for this probability density is\nH=log2rmax\u2212log2/Delta1r=log2/parenleftBigrmax\n/Delta1r/parenrightBig\n. (4.23)\nNote that the factor /Delta1r, expressing the resolution for \ufb01ring rates makes the\nargument of the logarithm dimensionless.\nEquation 4.22 is the basis of a signal processing technique called histogram histogram\nequalization equalization. Applied to neural responses, this is a procedure for tailoring\nthe neuronal selectivity so that p[r]=1/rmaxin response to a set of stimuli\nover which the entropy is to be maximized. Suppose a neuron respondsto a stimulus characterized by the parameter sby\ufb01ring at a rate r\n=f(s),\nwhere f(s)is the response tuning curve. For small /Delta1s, the probability\nthat the continuous stimulus variable falls in the range between sand s+\n/Delta1sis given in terms of the stimulus probability density by p[s]/Delta1s. This\nproduces a response that falls in the range between f(s+/Delta1s)and f(s).\nIf the response probability density takes its optimal value, p[r]=1/rmax,\nthe probability that the response falls within this range is |f(s+/Delta1s)\u2212\nf(s)|/rmax. Setting these two probabilities equal to each other, we \ufb01nd that\n|f(s+/Delta1s)\u2212f(s)|/rmax=p[s]/Delta1s. Consider the case of a monotonically\nincreasing response so that f(s+/Delta1s)> f(s)for positive /Delta1s. Then, in the\nlimit/Delta1s\u21920, the condition becomes\ndf\nds=rmaxp[s] (4.24)\nwhich has the solution\nf(s)=rmax/integraldisplays\nsminds/primep[s/prime] (4.25)\nwhere sminis the minimum value of s, which is assumed to generate no\nresponse. Thus, entropy maximization requires that the tuning curve ofthe responding neuron be proportional to the integral of the probabilitydensity of the stimulus.\nLaughlin (1981) has provided evidence that responses of the large monopo-\nlar cell (LMC) in the visual system of the \ufb02y satisfy the entropy maximiz-\ning condition.

As \ufb01gure 4.2 indicates, the response\ntuning curve as a function of contrast is very close to the integrated prob-ability density, suggesting that the LMC is using a maximum entropy en-coding.\nEven though neurons have maximum \ufb01ring rates, the constraint r\n\u2264rmax\nmay not always be the factor that limits the entropy. For example, the aver-\nage\ufb01ring rate of the neuron may be constrained to values much less than\nrmax, or the variance of the \ufb01ring rate might be constrained. The reader is\ninvited to show that the entropy maximizing probability density if the av-erage \ufb01ring rate is constrained to a \ufb01xed value is an exponential. A related\ncalculation shows that the probability density that maximizes the entropysubject to constraints on the \ufb01ring rate and its variance is a Gaussian.\nPopulations of Neurons\nWhen a population of neurons encodes a stimulus, optimizing their indi-\nvidual response properties will not necessarily lead to an optimized popu-lation response. Optimizing individual responses could result in a highlyredundant population representation in which different neurons encodethe same information. Entropy maximization for a population requires\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Information Theory\nthat the neurons convey independent pieces of information, i.e. they must\nhave different response selectivities. Let the vector rwith components ra\nfora=1,2,..., Ndenote the \ufb01ring rates for a population of Nneurons,\nmeasured with resolution /Delta1r.I fp[r] is the probability of evoking a pop-\nulation response characterized by the vector r, the entropy for the entire\npopulation response is\nH=\u2212/integraldisplay\ndrp[r]l o g2p[r]\u2212Nlog2/Delta1r. (4.26)\nAlong with the full population entropy of Equation 4.26, we can also con-\nsider the entropy associated with individual neurons within the popula-tion. If p[r\na]=/integraltext/producttext\nb/negationslash=adrbp[r] is the probability density for response ra\nfrom neuron a, its entropy is\nHa=\u2212/integraldisplay\ndrap[ra]l o g2p[ra]\u2212log2/Delta1r=\u2212/integraldisplay\ndrp[r]l o g2p[ra]\u2212log2/Delta1r.\n(4.27)\nThe true population entropy can never be greater than the sum of these\nindividual neuron entropies over the entire population,\nH\u2264/summationdisplay\naHa. (4.28)\nTo prove this, we note that the difference between the full entropy and the\nsum of individual neuron entropies is\n/summationdisplay\naHa\u2212H=/integraldisplay\ndrp[r]l o g2/parenleftbiggp[r]/producttext\napa[ra]/parenrightbigg\n\u22650. (4.29)\nThe inequality follows from the fact that the middle expression is the KL\ndivergence between the probability distributions p[r] and/producttext\nap[ra], and a\nKL divergence is always non-negative. Equality holds only if\np[r]=/productdisplay\nap[ra], (4.30)\ni.e. the responses of the neurons are statistically independent. Thus, the\nfull response entropy is never greater than the sum of the entropies ofthe individual neurons in the population, and it reaches the limiting valuewhen equation 4.30 is satis \ufb01ed. A code that satis \ufb01es this condition is called factorial code\na factorial code because the probability factorizes into a product of singleneuron probabilities. The entropy difference in equation 4.29 has beensuggested as a measure of redundancy. When the population responseprobability density factorizes, this implies that the individual neurons re-spond independently.\nCombining this result with the results of the previous section, we con-\nclude that the maximum population response entropy can be achieved\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.2 Information and Entropy Maximization 13\nby satisfying two conditions. First, the individual neurons must respond\nindependently, i.e. p[r]=/producttext\nap[ra] must factorize. Second, they must all factorization\nhave response probabilities that are optimal for whatever constraints areimposed, for example \ufb02at, exponential, or Gaussian. If the same con-\nstraint is imposed on every neuron, the second condition implies thatevery neuron must have the same response probability density. In otherwords p[r\na] must be the same for all avalues, a property called probability\nequalization. This does not imply that all the neurons respond identically probability\nequalization to every stimulus. Indeed, the conditional probabilities p[ra|s] must be dif-\nferent for different neurons if they are to act independently. We proceedby considering factorization and probability equalization as general prin-ciples of entropy maximization, without imposing explicit constraints.\nExact factorization and probability equalization are dif \ufb01cult to achieve,\nespecially if the form of the neural response is restricted. These goals arelikely to be impossible to achieve, for example, if the neural responses aremodeled as having a linear relation to the stimulus. A more modest goalis to require that the lowest order moments of the population responseprobability distribution match those of a fully factorized and equalizeddistribution. If the individual response probability distributions are equal,the average \ufb01ring rates and \ufb01ring rate variances will be the same for all\nneurons,\n/angbracketleftra/angbracketright=/angbracketleft r/angbracketrightand/angbracketleft(ra\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright)2/angbracketright=\u03c32\nrfor all a. The covariance matrix\nfor a factorized and probability equalized population distribution is thusproportional to the identity matrix,\nQ\nab=/integraldisplay\ndrp[r](ra\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright)(rb\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright)=\u03c32\nr\u03b4ab. (4.31)\nFinding response distributions that satisfy only the decorrelation and vari- decorrelation and\nvariance\nequalizationance equalization condition of equation 4.31 is usually tractable. In the fol-\nlowing examples, we will restrict ourselves to this easier task. This max-imizes the entropy only if the statistics of the responses are Gaussian, butit is a reasonable procedure even in a non-Gaussian case, because it typi-cally reduces the redundancy in the population code and spreads the loadof information transmission equally among the neurons.\nApplication to Retinal Ganglion Cell Receptive Fields\nEntropy and information maximization have been used to explain proper-ties of visual receptive \ufb01elds in the retina, LGN, and primary visual cor-\ntex. The basic assumption is that these receptive \ufb01elds serve to maximize\nthe amount of information that the associated neural responses conveyabout natural visual scenes in the presence of noise. Information theoret-ical analyses are sensitive to the statistical properties of the stimuli beingrepresented, so the statistics of natural scenes play an important role inthese studies. Natural scenes exhibit substantial spatial and temporal re-dundancy. Maximizing the information conveyed requires removing thisredundancy from the neural responses.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Information Theory\nIt should be kept in mind that the information maximization approach\nsets limited goals and requires strong assumptions about the nature of theconstraints relevant to the nervous system. In addition, the approach onlyanalyzes the representational properties of neural responses and ignoresthe computational goals of the visual system, such as object recognitionor target tracking. Finally, maximizing other measures of performance,different from the mutual information, may give similar results. Never-theless, the principal of information maximization is quite successful ataccounting for properties of receptive \ufb01elds early in the visual pathway.\nIn chapter 2, a visual image was de \ufb01ned by a contrast function s\n(x,y,t)\nwith an average value over trials of zero. For the calculations we present\nhere, it is more convenient to express the xand ycoordinates for locations\non the viewing screen in terms of a single vector /vectorx=(x,y), or sometimes\n/vectory=(x,y). Using this notation, the linear estimate of the response of a\nvisual neuron discussed in chapter 2 can be written as\nL(t)=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4/integraldisplay\nd/vectorxD(/vectorx,\u03c4)s(/vectorx,t\u2212\u03c4). (4.32)\nIf the space-time receptive \ufb01eldD(/vectorx,\u03c4)is separable, D(/vectorx,\u03c4)=Ds(/vectorx)Dt(\u03c4)\nand we can rewrite L(t)as the product of integrals involving temporal\nand spatial \ufb01lters. To keep the notation simple, we assume that the stimu-\nlus can also be separated, so that s(/vectorx,t)=ss(/vectorx)st(t). Then, L(t)=LsLt(t)\nwhere\nLs=/integraldisplay\nd/vectorxD s(/vectorx)ss(/vectorx) (4.33)\nand\nLt(t)=/integraldisplay\u221e\n0d\u03c4Dt(\u03c4)st(t\u2212\u03c4). (4.34)\nIn the following, we analyze the spatial and temporal components, Dsand\nDt, separately by considering the information carrying capacity of Lsand\nLt. We study the spatial receptive \ufb01elds of retinal ganglion cells in this sec-\ntion, and the temporal response properties of LGN cells in the next. Later,we discuss the application of information maximization ideas to primaryvisual cortex.\nTo derive appropriately optimal spatial \ufb01lters, we consider an array of\nretinal ganglion cells with receptive \ufb01elds covering a small patch of the\nretina. We assume that the statistics of the input are spatially (and tem-porally) stationary or translation invariant. This means that all locationsand directions in space (and all times), at least within the patch we con-sider, are equivalent. This equivalence allows us to give all of the receptive\ufb01elds the same spatial structure, with the receptive \ufb01elds of different cells\nmerely being shifted to different points within the visual \ufb01eld. As a result,\nwe write the spatial kernel describing a retinal ganglion cell with receptive\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.2 Information and Entropy Maximization 15\n\ufb01eld centered at the point /vectoraasDs(/vectorx\u2212/vectora). The linear response of this cell is\nthen\nLs(/vectora)=/integraldisplay\nd/vectorxD s(/vectorx\u2212/vectora)ss(/vectorx). (4.35)\nNote that we are labeling the neurons by the locations /vectoraof the centers of\ntheir receptive \ufb01elds rather than by an integer index such as i.T h i s i s a\nconvenient labeling scheme that allows sums over neurons to be replacedby sums over parameters describing their receptive \ufb01elds. The vectors\n/vectorafor the different neurons take on discrete values corresponding to the\ndifferent neurons in the population. If many neurons are being considered,these discrete vectors may \ufb01ll the range of receptive \ufb01eld locations quite\ndensely. In this case, it is reasonable to approximate the large but discreteset of\n/vectoravalues, with a vector /vectorathat is allowed to vary continuously. In\nother words, as an approximation, we proceed as if there were a neuroncorresponding to every continuous value of\n/vectora. This allows us to treat L(/vectora)\nas a function of /vectoraand to replace sums over neurons with integrals over\n/vectora. In the case we are considering, the receptive \ufb01elds of retinal ganglion\ncells cover the retina densely, with many receptive \ufb01elds overlapping each\npoint on the retina, so the replacement of discrete sums over neurons withcontinuous integrals over\n/vectorais quite accurate.\nThe Whitening Filter\nWe will not attempt a complete entropy maximization for the case of reti-\nnal ganglion cells, but rather will follow the approximate procedure ofsetting the correlation matrix between different neurons within the pop-ulation proportional to the identity matrix (equation 4.31). The relevantcorrelation, in this case, is the average over all stimuli of the product of thelinear responses of two cells, one with receptive \ufb01eld centered at\n/vectoraand the\nother at /vectorb,\nQLL(/vectora,/vectorb)=/angbracketleftLs(/vectora)Ls(/vectorb)/angbracketright=/integraldisplay\nd/vectorxd/vectoryD s(/vectorx\u2212/vectora)Ds(/vectory\u2212/vectorb)/angbracketleftss(/vectorx)ss(/vectory)/angbracketright.\n(4.36)\nThe average here, denoted by angle brackets, is not over trials but over the\nset of natural scenes for which we believe the receptive \ufb01eld is optimized.\nBy analogy with equation 4.31, decorrelation and variance equalization of\nthe different retinal ganglion cells, when /vectoraand/vectorbare taken to be continuous\nvariables, require that we set this correlation function proportional to a \u03b4\nfunction,\nQLL(/vectora,/vectorb)=\u03c32\nL\u03b4(/vectora\u2212/vectorb). (4.37)\nThis is the continuous variable analog of making a discrete correlation ma-\ntrix proportional to the identity matrix (equation 4.31). The \u03b4function with\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Information Theory\nvector arguments is only non-zero when all of the components of /vectoraand/vectorb\nare identical.\nThe quantity /angbracketleftss(/vectorx)ss(/vectory)/angbracketrightin equation 4.36 is the correlation function of the\nstimulus averaged over natural scenes. Our assumption of homogeneityimplies that this quantity is only a function of the vector difference\n/vectorx\u2212/vectory\n(actually, if all directions are equivalent, it is only a function of the magni-tude\n|/vectorx\u2212/vectory|), and we write it as\nQss(/vectorx\u2212/vectory)=/angbracketleftss(/vectorx)ss(/vectory)/angbracketright. (4.38)\nTo determine the form of the receptive \ufb01eld\ufb01lter that is optimal, we must\nsolve equation 4.37 for Ds. This is done by expressing Dsand Qssin terms\nof their Fourier transforms \u02dcDsand\u02dcQss,\nDs(/vectorx\u2212/vectora)=1\n4\u03c02/integraldisplay\nd/vectorkexp/parenleftBig\n\u2212i/vectork\u00b7(/vectorx\u2212/vectora)/parenrightBig\n\u02dcDs(/vectork) (4.39)\nQss(/vectorx\u2212/vectory)=1\n4\u03c02/integraldisplay\nd/vectorkexp/parenleftBig\n\u2212i/vectork\u00b7(/vectorx\u2212/vectory)/parenrightBig\n\u02dcQss(/vectork). (4.40)\n\u02dcQss, which is real and non-negative, is also called the stimulus power spec-\ntrum (see chapter 1). In terms of these Fourier transforms, equation 4.37becomes\n|\u02dcDs(/vectork)|2\u02dcQss(/vectork)=\u03c32\nL (4.41)\nfrom which we \ufb01nd\n|\u02dcDs(/vectork)|=\u03c3L/radicalBig\n\u02dcQss(/vectork). (4.42)\nThe linear kernel described by equation 4.42 exactly compensates for whitening \ufb01lter\nwhatever dependence the Fourier transform of the stimulus correlation\nfunction has on the spatial frequency /vectorksuch that the product \u02dcQss(/vectork)|\u02dcDs(/vectork)|2\nis independent of /vectork. This product is the power spectrum of L.T h e o u t -\nput of the optimal \ufb01lter has a power spectrum that is independent of spa-\ntial frequency, and therefore has the same characteristics as white noise.Therefore, the kernel in equation 4.42 is called a whitening \ufb01lter. Differ-\nent spatial frequencies act independently in a linear system, so decorrela-tion and variance equalization require them to be utilized at equal signalstrength. The calculation we have performed only determines the ampli-\ntude\n|\u02dcDs(/vectork)|and not \u02dcDs(/vectork)itself. Thus, decorrelation and variance equal-\nization do not uniquely specify the form of the linear kernel. We studysome consequences of the freedom to choose different linear kernels satis-fying equation 4.42 later in the chapter.\nThe spatial correlation function for natural scenes has been measured,\nwith the result that\n\u02dcQss(/vectork)is proportional to 1 /|/vectork|2over the range it has\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n4.2 Information and Entropy Maximization 17\nbeen evaluated. The behavior near /vectork=0 is not well established, but the\ndivergence of 1 /|/vectork|2near/vectork=0 can be removed by setting \u02dcQss(/vectork)propor-\ntional to 1 /(|/vectork|2+k2\n0)where k0is a constant. The stimuli of interest in the\ncalculation of retinal ganglion receptive \ufb01elds are natural images as they\nappear on the retina, not in the photographs from which the natural scenes\nstatistics are measured. An additional factor must be included in \u02dcQss(/vectork)to\naccount for \ufb01ltering introduced by the optics of the eye (the optical modu-\nlation transfer function). A simple model of the optical modulation trans-fer function results in an exponential correction to the stimulus correlation optical modulation\ntransfer function function\n\u02dcQss(/vectork)\u221dexp(\u2212\u03b1|/vectork|)\n|/vectork|2+k2\n0. (4.43)\nPutting this into equation 4.42 gives a rather peculiar result; the ampli-\ntude|\u02dcDs(/vectork)|, being proportional to the inverse of the square root of \u02dcQss,i s\npredicted to grow exponentially for large |/vectork|. Whitening \ufb01lters maximize\nentropy by equalizing the distribution of response power over the entirespatial frequency range. High spatial frequency components of images arerelatively rare in natural scenes and, even as they occur, are greatly atten-uated by the eye. The whitening \ufb01lter compensates for this by boosting\nthe responses to high spatial frequencies. Although this is the result ofthe entropy maximization calculation, it is not a good strategy to use inan unrestricted way for visual processing. Real inputs to retinal ganglioncells involve a mixture of true signal and noise coming from biophysicalsources in the retina. At high spatial frequencies, for which the true sig-nal is weak, inputs to retinal ganglion cells are likely to be dominated bynoise, especially in low-light conditions. Boosting the amplitude of thisnoise-dominated input and transmitting it to the brain is not an ef \ufb01cient\nvisual encoding strategy.\nThe problem of excessive boosting of responses at high spatial frequency\narises in the entropy maximization calculation because no distinction hasbeen made between the entropy coming from true signals and that comingfrom noise. To correct this problem, we should maximize the informationtransmitted by the retinal ganglion cells about natural scenes, rather thanmaximize the entropy. A full information maximization calculation of thereceptive \ufb01eld properties of retinal ganglion cells can be performed, but\nthis requires introducing a number of assumptions about the constraintsthat are relevant, and it is not entirely obvious what these constraintsshould be. Instead, we will follow an approximate procedure that pre-\ufb01lters the input to eliminate as much noise as possible, and then uses the\nresults of this section to maximize the entropy of a linear \ufb01lter acting on\nthe pre- \ufb01ltered input signal.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Information Theory\nFiltering Input Noise\nSuppose that the visual stimulus on the retina is the sum of the true stim-\nulus ss(/vectorx)that should be conveyed to the brain and a noise term \u03b7(/vectorx)that\nre\ufb02ects image distortion, photoreceptor noise, and other signals that are\nnot worth conveying beyond the retina. To deal with such a mixed input\nsignal, we express the Fourier transform of the linear kernel \u02dcDs(/vectork)as a\nproduct of two terms, a noise \ufb01lter,\u02dcD\u03b7(/vectork), that eliminates as much of the\nnoise as possible, and a whitening \ufb01lter,\u02dcDw(/vectork), that satis \ufb01es equation 4.42.\nThe Fourier transform of the complete \ufb01lter is then \u02dcDs(/vectork)=\u02dcDw(/vectork)\u02dcD\u03b7(/vectork).\nTo determine the form of the noise \ufb01lter, we demand that when it is ap-\nplied to the total input ss(/vectorx)+\u03b7(/vectorx), the result is as close to the signal part\nof the input, ss(/vectorx), as possible. As in the previous section, it is easiest\nto perform the necessary calculations in the Fourier-transformed spatialfrequency domain. Thus, we express the difference between the \ufb01ltered\ninput and the true signal in terms of the Fourier transforms of the signal\nand noise,\n\u02dcs(/vectork)and\u02dc\u03b7(/vectork). The Fourier transform of the output of the noise\n\ufb01lter is \u02dcD\u03b7(/vectork)(\u02dcs(/vectork)+\u02dc\u03b7(/vectork)), and we want to make this as close as possible to\nthe Fourier transform of the pure signal, \u02dcs(/vectork). To do this, we minimize the\nintegral over /vectorkof the squared amplitude of the difference between these\ntwo quantities, averaged over natural scenes,\n/angbracketleftbigg/integraldisplay\nd/vectork/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u02dcD\u03b7(/vectork)/parenleftBig\n\u02dcs(/vectork)+\u02dc\u03b7(/vectork)/parenrightBig\n\u2212\u02dcs(/vectork)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2/angbracketrightbigg\n. (4.44)\nNote that the squared amplitude of a complex quantity such as \u02dcs(/vectork)is/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\u02dcs(/vectork)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2\n=\u02dcs(/vectork)\u02dcs\u2217(/vectork)where \u02dcs\u2217(/vectork)is the complex conjugate of \u02dcs(/vectork). Setting\nthe derivative of equation 4.44 with respect to \u02dcD\u2217\n\u03b7(/vectork/prime)to zero gives\n/integraldisplay\nd/vectork\u02dcD\u03b7(/vectork)/parenleftBig/angbracketleftBig\n\u02dcs(/vectork)\u02dcs\u2217(/vectork/prime)/angbracketrightBig\n+/angbracketleftBig\n\u02dc\u03b7(/vectork)\u02dc\u03b7\u2217(/vectork/prime)/angbracketrightBig/parenrightBig\n=/integraldisplay\nd/vectork/angbracketleftBig\n\u02dcs(/vectork)\u02dcs\u2217(/vectork/prime)/angbracketrightBig\n.

Under low noise conditions\n(solid lines in \ufb01gure 4.3), the linear kernel has a bandpass character and the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Information Theory\npredicted receptive \ufb01eld has a center-surround structure, which matches\nthe retinal ganglion receptive \ufb01elds shown in chapter 2. This structure\neliminates one major source of redundancy in natural scenes; the strongsimilarity of neighboring inputs owing to the predominance of low spatialfrequencies in images.\nWhen the noise level is high (dashed lines in \ufb01gure 4.3), the structure of\nthe optimal receptive \ufb01eld is different. In spatial frequency terms, the \ufb01lter\nis now low-pass, and the receptive \ufb01eld loses its surround. This structure\naverages over neighboring pixels to extract the true signal obscured by theuncorrelated noise. In the retina, we expect the signal-to-noise ratio to becontrolled by the level of ambient light, with low levels of illumination cor-responding to the high noise case. The predicted change in the receptive\ufb01elds at low illumination (high noise) matches what actually happens in\nthe retina. At low light levels, circuitry changes within the retina removethe opposing surrounds from retinal ganglion cell receptive \ufb01elds.\nTemporal Processing in the LGN\nJust as many aspects of the visual world vary gradually across space, nat-\nural images also tend to change slowly over time. This means that there issubstantial redundancy in the succession of natural images, suggesting anopportunity for ef \ufb01cient temporal \ufb01ltering to complement ef \ufb01cient spatial\n\ufb01ltering. An analysis similar to that of the previous section can be per-\nformed to account for the temporal receptive \ufb01elds of visually responsive\nneurons early in the visual pathway. Recall that the predicted linear tem-poral response is given by L\nt(t)as expressed in equation 4.34. The analog\nof equation 4.37 for temporal decorrelation and variance equalization is\n/angbracketleftLt(t)Lt(t/prime)/angbracketright=\u03c32\nL\u03b4(t\u2212t/prime). (4.50)\nThis is mathematically identical to equation 4.37 except that the role of\nthe spatial variables /vectoraand/vectorbhas been replaced by the temporal variables\ntand t/prime. The analysis proceeds exactly as above and the optimal \ufb01lter is\nthe product of a noise \ufb01lter and a temporal whitening \ufb01lter as before. The\ntemporal linear kernel Dt(\u03c4)is written in terms of its Fourier transform\nDt(\u03c4)=1\n2\u03c0/integraldisplay\nd\u03c9exp(\u2212i\u03c9\u03c4)\u02dcDt(\u03c9) (4.51)\nand\u02dcDt(\u03c9)is given by an equation similar to 4.49,\n|\u02dcDt(\u03c9)|\u221d\u03c3L/radicalBig\n\u02dcQss(\u03c9)\n\u02dcQss(\u03c9)+\u02dcQ\u03b7\u03b7(\u03c9).

(Adapted from Dong and Atick, 1995; data in A from Saul and\nHumphrey, 1990.)\nDong and Atick (1995) analyzed temporal receptive \ufb01elds in the LGN in\nthis way under the assumption that a substantial fraction of the tempo-ral redundancy of visual stimuli is removed in the LGN rather than inthe retina. They determined that the temporal power spectrum of naturalscenes has the form\n\u02dcQss(\u03c9)\u221d1\n\u03c92+\u03c92\n0(4.53)\nwhere \u03c90is a constant. The resulting \ufb01lter, in both the temporal frequency\nand time domains, is plotted in \ufb01gure 4.4. Figure 4.4A shows the predicted\nand actual frequency responses of an LGN cell. This is similar to the plotin\ufb01gure 4.3A except that the result has been normalized to a realistic re-\nsponse level so that it can be compared with data. Because the optimiza-tion procedure only determines the amplitude of the Fourier transform ofthe linear kernel, D\nt(\u03c4)is not uniquely speci \ufb01ed. To uniquely specify the\ntemporal kernel we require it to be causal ( Dt(\u03c4)=0f o r\u03c4< 0) and im-\npose a technical condition known as minimum phase, which assures thatthe output changes as rapidly as possible when the stimulus varies. Fig-ure 4.4B shows the resulting form of the temporal \ufb01lter. The space-time\nreceptive \ufb01elds shown in chapter 2 tend to change sign as a function of\n\u03c4.\nThe temporal \ufb01lter in \ufb01gure 4.4B has exactly this property.\nAn interesting test of the notion of optimal coding was carried out by Dan,\nAtick, and Reid (1996). They used both natural scene and white-noisestimuli while recording cat LGN cells. Figure 4.5A shows the power spec-tra of spike trains of cat LGN cells in response to natural scenes (the movieCasablanca ), and \ufb01gure 4.5B shows power spectra for white-noise stimuli.\nThe power spectra of the responses to natural scenes are quite \ufb02at above\nabout\n\u03c9=3 Hz. In response to white noise, on the other hand, they rise\nwith\u03c9.

In the case of natural stimuli, the whitening\n\ufb01lter evenly distributes the output power over a broad frequency range.\nResponses to white-noise stimuli increase at high frequencies due to theboosting of inputs at these frequencies by the whitening \ufb01lter.\nCortical Coding\nComputational concerns beyond mere linear information transfer are\nlikely to be relevant at the level of cortical processing of visual images.For one thing, the primary visual cortex has many more neurons than theLGN, yet they can collectively convey no more information about the vi-sual world than they receive. As we saw in chapter 2, neurons in primaryvisual cortex are selective for quantities such as spatial frequency and ori-entation that are of particular importance in relation to object recognitionbut not for information transfer. Nevertheless, the methods described inthe previous section can be used to understand restricted aspects of re-ceptive \ufb01elds of neurons in primary visual cortex, namely the way that\nthe multiple selectivities are collectively assigned. For example, cells thatrespond best at high spatial frequencies tend to respond more to low tem-poral frequency components of images, and vice-versa.\nThe stimulus power spectrum written as a function of both spatial and\ntemporal frequency has been estimated as\nQ\nss(/vectork,\u03c9)\u221d1\n|/vectork|2+\u03b12\u03c92(4.54)\nwhere \u03b1=0.4 cycle seconds/degree.

(Adapted from Li, 1996.)\nboth for high spatial and high temporal frequencies. Figure 4.6 shows how\ntemporal selectivity for a combined noise and whitening \ufb01lter constructed\nusing this stimulus power spectrum changes for different preferred spatialfrequencies. The basic idea is that components with fairly low stimuluspower are boosted by the whitening \ufb01lter, while those with very low stim-\nulus power get suppressed by the noise \ufb01lter. As shown by Li (1996), if a\ncell is selective for high spatial frequencies, the input signal rapidly fallsbelow the noise (treated as white) as the temporal frequency of the input isincreased. As a result, the noise \ufb01lter of equation 4.48 causes the temporal\nresponse to be largest at zero temporal frequency (dashed curve of \ufb01gure\n4.6). If instead, the cell is selective for low spatial frequencies, the signaldominates the noise up to higher temporal frequencies, and the whitening\ufb01lter causes the response to increase as a function of temporal frequency\nup to a maximum value where the noise \ufb01lter begins to suppress the re-\nsponse (solid curve in \ufb01gure 4.6). Model receptive \ufb01elds with preference\nfor high spatial frequency thus act as low-pass temporal \ufb01lters, and re-\nceptive \ufb01elds with selectivity for low spatial frequency act as band-pass\ntemporal \ufb01lters.\nSimilar conclusions can be drawn concerning other joint selectivities. For\ninstance, color selective (chrominance) cells tend to be selective for lowtemporal frequencies, because their input signal to noise ratio is lowerthan that for broad-band (luminance) cells. There is also an interestingpredicted relationship between ocular dominance and spatial frequencytuning due to the nature of the correlations between the two eyes. Opti-mal receptive \ufb01elds with low spatial frequency tuning (for which the in-\nput signal-to-noise ratio is high) have enhanced sensitivity to differencesbetween inputs coming from the two eyes. Receptive \ufb01elds tuned to inter-\nmediate and high spatial frequencies suppress ocular differences.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n24 Information Theory\n4.3 Entropy and Information for Spike Trains\nComputing the entropy or information content of a neuronal response\ncharacterized by spike times is much more dif \ufb01cult than computing these\nquantities for responses described by \ufb01ring rates. Nevertheless, these com-\nputations are important, because \ufb01ring rates are incomplete descriptions\nthat can lead to serious underestimates of the entropy and information. Inthis section, we discuss how the entropy and mutual information can becomputed for spike trains. Extensive further discussion can be found inthe book by Rieke et al. (1997).\nSpike-train entropy calculations are typically based on the study of long-\nduration recordings consisting of many action potentials. The entropy ormutual information typically grows linearly with the length of the spiketrain being considered. For this reason, the entropy and mutual informa-tion of spike trains are reported as entropy or information rates. These entropy and\ninformation rates are the total entropy or information divided by the duration of the spike\ntrain. We write the entropy rate as hrather than H. Alternately, entropy\nand mutual information can be divided by the total number of action po-tentials and reported as bits per spike rather than bits per second.\nTo compute entropy and information rates for a spike train, we need to\ndetermine the probabilities that various temporal patterns of action poten-tials appear. These probabilities replace the factors P[r]o r p[r] that occur\nwhen discrete or continuous \ufb01ring rates are used to characterize a neu-\nral response. The temporal pattern of a group of action potentials can bespeci\ufb01ed by listing either the individual spike times or the sequence of in-\ntervals between successive spikes. The entropy and mutual informationcalculations we present are based on a spike-time description, but as aninitial example we consider an approximate computation of entropy us-ing interspike intervals.\nThe probability of an interspike interval falling in the range between\n\u03c4and\n\u03c4+/Delta1\u03c4is given in terms of the interspike interval probability density by\np[\u03c4]/Delta1\u03c4. Because the interspike interval is a continuous variable, we must\nspecify a resolution /Delta1\u03c4with which it is measured to de \ufb01ne the entropy. If\nthe different interspike interval are statistically independent, the entropyassociated with the interspike intervals in a spike train of average rate\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\nand of duration Tis the number of intervals, /angbracketleftr/angbracketrightT, times the integral over \u03c4\nof\u2212p[\u03c4]l o g2(p[\u03c4]/Delta1\u03c4). The entropy rate is obtained by dividing this result\nbyT, and the entropy per spike requires dividing by the number of spikes,\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightT. The assumption of independent interspike intervals is critical for ob-\ntaining the spike-train entropy solely in terms of p[\u03c4]. Correlations be-\ntween different interspike intervals reduce the total entropy, so the resultobtained by assuming independent intervals provides an upper bound onthe true entropy of a spike train. Thus, in general, the entropy rate hfor\na spike train with interspike interval distribution p[\n\u03c4] and average rate /angbracketleftr/angbracketright\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(4.55)\nIf a spike train is described by a homogeneous Poisson process with rate\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright, we have p[\u03c4]=/angbracketleftr/angbracketrightexp(\u2212/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\u03c4), and the interspikes are statistically in-\ndependent (chapter 1). Equation 4.55 is then an equality and, performing Poisson entropy\nrate the integrals,\n/angbracketlefth/angbracketright=/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\nln(2)(1\u2212ln(/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/Delta1\u03c4)). (4.56)\nWe now turn to a more general calculation of the spike-train entropy. To\nmake entropy calculations practical, a long spike train is broken into sta-tistically independent subunits, and the total entropy is written as the sumof the entropies for the individual subunits. In the case of equation 4.55,the subunit was the interspike interval. If interspike intervals are not in-dependent and we wish to compute a result and not merely a bound, wemust work with larger subunit descriptions. Strong, Koberle, de Ruytervan Steveninck, and Bialek (1998) proposed a scheme that uses spike se-quences of duration T\nsas these basic subunits. Note that the variable Tsis\nused here to denote the duration of the spike sequence being considered,while T, which is much larger than T\ns, is the duration of the entire spike\ntrain.\nThe time that a spike occurs is a continuous variable so, as in the case\nof interspike intervals, a resolution must be speci \ufb01ed when spike train\nentropies are computed. This can be done by dividing time into discretebins of size\n/Delta1t. We assume that the bins are small enough so that not more\nthan one spike appears in a bin. Depending on whether or not a spikeoccurred within it, each bin is labeled by a zero (no spike) or a one (spike).A spike sequence de \ufb01ned over a block of duration T\nsis thus represented\nby a string of Ts//Delta1tzeros and ones. We denote such a sequence by B(t),\nwhere Bis aTs//Delta1tbit binary number, and tspeci\ufb01e st h et i m eo ft h e \ufb01rst\nbin in the sequence being considered. Both Tsand tare integer multiples\nof the bin size /Delta1t.\nThe probability of a sequence Boccurring at any time during the entire re-\nsponse is denoted by P[B]. This can be obtained by counting the number\nof times the sequence Boccurs anywhere within the spike trains being an-\nalyzed (including overlapping cases). The spike-train entropy rate impliedby this distribution is\nh\n=\u22121\nTs/summationdisplay\nBP[B]l o g2P[B], (4.57)\nwhere the sum is over all the sequences Bfound in the data set, and we\nhave divided by the duration Tsof a single sequence.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Information Theory\nIf the spike sequences in non-overlapping intervals of duration Tsare in-\ndependent, the full spike-train entropy rate is also given by equation 4.57.However, any correlations between successive intervals (if B\n(t+Ts)is cor-\nrelated with B(t), for example) reduce the total spike-train entropy, caus-\ning equation 4.57 to overestimate the true entropy rate. Thus, for \ufb01nite Ts,\nthis equation provides an upper bound on the true entropy rate. If Tsis too\nsmall, B(t+Ts)and B(t)are likely to be correlated, and the overestimate\nmay be severe. As Tsincreases, we expect the correlations to get smaller,\nand equation 4.57 should provide a more accurate value. For any \ufb01nite\ndata set, Tscannot be increased past a certain point, because there will\nnot be enough spike sequences of duration Tsin the data set to determine\ntheir probabilities. Thus, in practice, Tsmust be increased until the point\nwhere the extraction of probabilities becomes problematic, and some formof extrapolation to T\ns\u2192\u221e must be made.\nStatistical mechanics arguments suggest that the difference between the\nentropy for \ufb01nite Tsand the true entropy for Ts\u2192\u221e should be propor-\ntional to 1 /Tsfor large Ts. Therefore, the true entropy can be estimated, as\nin\ufb01gure 4.7, by linearly extrapolating a plot of the entropy rate versus 1 /Ts\nto the point 1 /Ts=0. In\ufb01gure 4.7 (upper line), this has been done for data\nfrom the motion sensitive H1 neuron of the \ufb02y visual system. The plotted\npoints show entropy rates computed for different values of 1 /Ts, and they\nvary linearly over most of the range of the plot. However, when 1 /Tsgoes\nbelow about 20/s (or Ts=50 ms), the variation suddenly increases. This\nis the point at which the amount of data is insuf \ufb01cient to extract even an\noverestimate of the entropy. By linearly extrapolating the linear part of theseries of computed points in \ufb01gure 4.7, Strong et al. estimated that the H1\nspike trains had an entropy rate of 157 bits/s for a resolution of\n/Delta1t=3 ms.\nTo compute the mutual information rate for a spike train, we must sub-\ntract the noise entropy rate from the full spike-train entropy rate. Thenoise entropy rate is determined from the probabilities of \ufb01nding various\nsequences Bgiven that they were evoked by the same stimulus. This is\ndone by considering sequences B\n(t)that start at a \ufb01xed time t. If the same\nstimulus is used in repeated trials, sequences that begin at time tin every\ntrial are generated by the same stimulus. Therefore, the conditional prob-ability of the response given the stimulus is, in this case, the distribution\nP[B\n(t)] for response sequences beginning at the time t. This is obtained\nby determining the fraction of trials on which B(t)was evoked. Note that\nP[B(t)] is the probability of \ufb01nding a given sequence at time twithin a\nset of spike trains obtained on trials using the same stimulus. In contrast,\nP[B], used in the spike-train entropy calculation, is the probability of \ufb01nd-\ning the sequence Bat any time within these trains. Determining P[B(t)]f o r\nas u f\ufb01cient number of spike sequences may take a large number of trials\nusing the same stimulus.\nThe full noise entropy is computed by averaging the noise entropy at time\ntover all tvalues. The average over tplays the role of the average over\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

This occurs when there is insuf \ufb01cient data to compute the spike\nsequence probabilities.

The true noise entropy rate is es-timated by performing a linear extrapolation in 1\n/Tsto 1/Ts=0, as was\ndone for the spike-train entropy rate. This is done for the H1 data in \ufb01gure\n4.7. The result is a noise entropy of 79 bits/s for /Delta1t=3 ms. The infor-\nmation rate is obtained by taking the difference between the extrapolatedvalues for the spike-train and noise entropy rates. The result for the \ufb02yH 1\nneuron used in \ufb01gure 4.7, is an information rate of 157 - 79 = 78 bits/s or\n1.8 bits/spike. Values in the range 1 to 3 bits/spike are typical results ofsuch calculations for a variety of preparations.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Information Theory\nBoth the spike-train and noise entropy rates depend on /Delta1t. The leading\ndependence, coming from the log2/Delta1tterm discussed previously, cancels\nin the computation of the information rate, but the information can still de-pend on\n/Delta1tthrough non-divergent terms. This re \ufb02ects the fact that more\ninformation can be extracted from accurately measured spike times thanfrom poorly measured spike times. Thus, we expect the information rateto increase with decreasing\n/Delta1t, at least over some range of /Delta1tvalues. At\nsome critical value of /Delta1tthat matches the natural degree of noise jitter in\nthe spike timings, we expect the information rate to stop increasing. Thisvalue of\n/Delta1tis interesting because it tells us about the degree of spike tim-\ning accuracy in neural encoding.\nThe information conveyed by spike trains can be used to compare re-\nsponses to different stimuli and thereby reveal stimulus-speci \ufb01ca s p e c t s\nof neural encoding. For instance, Rieke, Bodnar and Bialek (1995) com-pared the information conveyed by single neurons in a peripheral audi-tory organ (the amphibian papilla) of the bullfrog in response to broad-band noise or to noise \ufb01ltered to have an amplitude spectrum close to that\nof natural bullfrog calls (although the phases for each frequency compo-nent were chosen randomly). They determined that the cells conveyed onaverage 46 bits per second (1.4 bits per spike) for broad-band noise and133 bits per second (7.8 bits per spike) for stimuli with call-like spectra,despite the fact that the broad-band noise had a higher entropy. The spiketrains in response to the call-like stimuli conveyed information with nearmaximal ef \ufb01ciency.\n4.4 Chapter Summary\nShannon\u2019s information theory can be used to determine how much a neu-\nral response tells both us, and presumably the animal in which the neuronlives, about a stimulus. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or surpriseassociated with a stochastic variable, such as a stimulus. Mutual informa-tion quanti \ufb01es the reduction in uncertainty associated with the observa-\ntion of another variable, such as a response. The mutual information isrelated to the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distri-butions. We de \ufb01ned the response and noise entropies for probability dis-\ntributions of discrete and and continuous \ufb01ring rates and considered how\nthe information transmitted about a set of stimuli might be optimized.The principles of entropy and information maximization were used to ac-count for features of the receptive \ufb01elds of cells in the retina, LGN, and\nprimary visual cortex. This analysis introduced probability factorizationand equalization and whitening and noise \ufb01lters. Finally, we discussed\nhow the information conveyed about dynamic stimuli by spike sequencescan be estimated.\nInformation theoretic principles also lie at the heart of many of the unsu-\npervised learning methods that are discussed in chapters 8 and 10 which\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Such models range from highly detailed descriptionsinvolving thousands of coupled differential equations to greatly simpli-\ufb01ed caricatures useful for studying large interconnected networks. In this\nchapter, we discuss the basic electrical properties of neurons and the math-ematical models by which they are described. We present a simple butnevertheless useful model neuron, the integrate-and- \ufb01re model, in a basic\nversion and with added membrane and synaptic conductances. We alsodiscuss the Hodgkin-Huxley model, which describes the conductances re-sponsible for generating action potentials. In chapter 6, we continue bypresenting more complex models, both in terms of their conductances andtheir morphology. Circuits and networks of model neurons are discussedin chapter 7. This chapter makes use of basic concepts of electrical circuittheory, which are reviewed in the Mathematical Appendix.\n5.2 Electrical Properties of Neurons\nLike other cells, neurons are packed with a huge number and variety ofions and molecules.

This insulating feature causes thecell membrane to act as a capacitor by separating the charges lying alongits interior and exterior surfaces. Numerous ion-conducting channels em- ion channels\nbedded in the cell membrane ( \ufb01gure 5.1) lower the effective membrane\nresistance for ion \ufb02ow to a value about 10,000 times smaller than that of a\npure lipid bilayer. The resulting membrane conductance depends on thedensity and types of ion channels. A typical neuron may have a dozenor more different types of channels, anywhere from a few to hundreds ofchannels in a square micron of membrane, and hundreds of thousands tomillions of channels in all. Many, but not all, channels are highly selective, channel selectivity\nallowing only a single type of ion to pass through them (to an accuracy ofabout 1 ion in 10\n4). The capacity of channels for conducting ions across the\ncell membrane can be modi \ufb01ed by many factors including the membrane\npotential (voltage-dependent channels), the internal concentration of vari-ous intracellular messengers (Ca\n2+-dependent channels, for example), and\nthe extracellular concentration of neurotransmitters or neuromodulators(synaptic receptor channels, for example). The membrane also containsselective pumps that expend energy to maintain differences in the concen- ion pumps\ntrations of ions inside and outside the cell.\nchannel\npore\nlipid bilayer\nFigure 5.1: A schematic diagram of a section of the lipid bilayer that forms the\ncell membrane with two ion channels embedded in it. The membrane is 3 to 4 nmthick and the ion channels are about 10 nm long. (Adapted from Hille, 1992.)\nBy convention, the potential of the extracellular \ufb02uid outside a neuron is\nde\ufb01ned to be zero. When a neuron is inactive, the excess internal negative\ncharge causes the potential inside the cell membrane to be negative. This membrane potential\npotential is an equilibrium point at which the \ufb02ow of ions into the cell\nmatches that out of the cell. The potential can change if the balance of ion\ufb02ow is modi \ufb01ed by the opening or closing of ion channels. Under normal\nconditions, neuronal membrane potentials vary over a range from about-90 to +50 mV. The order of magnitude of these potentials can be estimatedfrom basic physical principles.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.2 Electrical Properties of Neurons 3\nMembrane potentials are small enough to allow neurons to take advan-\ntage of thermal energy to help transport ions across the membrane, but arelarge enough so that thermal \ufb02uctuations do not swamp the signaling ca-\npabilities of the neuron. These conditions imply that potential differencesacross the cell membrane must lie in a range so that the energy gained orlost by an ion traversing the membrane is the same order of magnitude asits thermal energy. The thermal energy of an ion is about k\nBTwhere kB\nis the Boltzmann constant and Tis the temperature on an absolute Kelvin\nscale. For chemists and biologists (though not for physicists), it is morecustomary to discuss moles of ions rather than single ions. A mole of ionshas Avagadro\u2019s number times as much thermal energy as a single ion, or\nRT, where Ris the universal gas constant, equal to 8.31 joules/mol K\n\u25e6\n= 1.99 cal/mol K\u25e6.RTis about 2500 joules/mol or 0.6 kCal/mol at nor-\nmal temperatures. To estimate the size of typical membrane potentials, weequate this to the energy gained or lost when a mole of ions crosses a mem-brane with a potential difference V\nTacross it. This energy is FVTwhere\nFis the Faraday constant, F= 96,480 Coulombs/mol, equal to Avagadro\u2019s\nnumber times the charge of a single proton, q. Setting FVT=RTgives VT\nVT=RT\nF=kBT\nq. (5.1)\nThis is an important parameter that enters into a number of calculations.\nVTis between 24 and 27 mV for the typical temperatures of cold and\nwarm-blooded animals. This sets the overall scale for membrane poten-tials across neuronal membranes, which range from about -3 to +2 times\nV\nT.\nIntracellular Resistance\nMembrane potentials measured at different places within a neuron cantake different values. For example, the potentials in the soma, dendrite,and axon can all be different. Potential differences between different partsof a neuron cause ions to \ufb02ow within the cell, which tends to equalize\nthese differences. The intracellular medium provides a resistance to such\ufb02ow. This resistance is highest for long and narrow stretches of dendritic\nor axonal cable, such as the segment shown in \ufb01gure 5.2. The longitudi-\nnal current I\nL\ufb02owing along such a cable segment can be computed from longitudinal\ncurrent I L Ohm\u2019s law. For the cylindrical segment of dendrite shown in \ufb01gure 5.2,\nthe longitudinal current \ufb02owing from right to left satis \ufb01esV2\u2212V1=ILRL.\nHere, RLis the longitudinal resistance, which grows in proportion to the longitudinal\nresistance R L length of the segment (long segments have higher resistances than shortones) and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the seg-ment (thin segments have higher resistances than fat ones). The constantof proportionality is called the intracellular resistivity, r\nL, and it typically intracellular\nresistivity r L falls in a range from 1 to 3 k /Omega1\u00b7mm. The longitudinal resistance of the seg-\nment in \ufb01gure 5.2 is rLtimes the length Ldivided by the cross-sectional\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\narea\u03c0a2,RL=rLL/\u03c0a2.

The arrow in-\ndicates the direction of positive current \ufb02ow. The constant rLis the intracellular\nresistivity, and a typical value is given.\nWe can also use the intracellular resistivity to estimate crudely the con-\nductance of a single channel. The conductance, being the inverse of a re- single-channel\nconductance sistance, is equal to the cross-sectional area of the channel pore divided by\nits length and by rLWe approximate the channel pore as a tube of length 6\nnm and opening area 0.15 nm2. This gives an estimate of 0.15 nm2/(1k/Omega1\nmm\u00d76n m ) \u224825 pS, which is the right order of magnitude for a channel\nconductance.\nMembrane Capacitance and Resistance\nThe intracellular resistance to current \ufb02ow can cause substantial differ-\nences in the membrane potential measured in different parts of a neuron,especially during rapid transient excursions of the membrane potentialfrom its resting value, such as action potentials. Neurons that have few ofthe long and narrow cable segments that produce high longitudinal resis-tance may have relatively uniform membrane potentials across their sur-faces. Such neurons are termed electrotonically compact. For electroton- electrotonic\ncompactness ically compact neurons, or for less compact neurons in situations where\nspatial variations in the membrane potential are not thought to play animportant functional role, the entire neuron may be adequately describedby a single membrane potential. Here, we discuss the membrane capaci-tance and resistance using such a description. An analysis for the case ofspatially varying membrane potentials is presented in chapter 6.\nWe have mentioned that there is typically an excess negative charge on\nthe inside surface of the cell membrane of a neuron, and a balancing pos-itive charge on its outside surface ( \ufb01gure 5.3). In this arrangement, the membrane\ncapacitance C\nm cell membrane creates a capacitance Cm, and the voltage across the mem-\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The membrane capacitance is\nproportional to the total amount of membrane or, equivalently, to the sur-face area of the cell.

For a neuron with a total membrane capacitance of 1 nF, 7 \u00d710\u221211Co r\nabout 109singly charged ions are required to produce a resting potential\nof -70 mV. This is about a hundred-thousandth of the total number of ionsin a neuron and is the amount of charge delivered by a 0.7 nA current in100 ms.\n--\n----\n-\n-----+++\n+++\n+++\n++\n/A1 /CE /BP /C1/CT\n/CA/D1/CA/D1\n/BP /D6/D1\n/BP /BT/D6/D1\n/AP /BD/C5 \ua732 /A1 /D1/D1\n/BE\n/C9 /BP /BV/D1\n/CE/BV/D1\n/BP /CR/D1\n/BT/CR/D1\n/AP /BD/BC/D2/BY /BP /D1/D1\n/BE\n/C1/CT/BT/D6/CT/CP /BP /BT\nFigure 5.3: The capacitance and membrane resistance of a neuron considered as\na single compartment.

Holding the mem-brane potential steady at a level different from its resting value also re-quires current, but this current is determined by the membrane resistancerather than by the capacitance of the cell. For example, if a small constantcurrent I\neis injected into a neuron through an electrode, as in \ufb01gure 5.3, the\nmembrane potential will shift away from its resting value by an amount\n/Delta1Vgiven by Ohm\u2019s law, /Delta1V=IeRm.Rmis known as the membrane or\ninput resistance. The restriction to small currents and small /Delta1Vis required membrane\nresistance R m because membrane resistances can vary as a function of voltage, whereasOhm\u2019s law assumes R\nmis constant over the range /Delta1V.\nThe membrane resistance is the inverse of the membrane conductance, membrane\nconductance and, like the capacitance, the conductance of a piece of cell membrane\nis proportional to its surface area. The constant of proportionality is themembrane conductance per unit area, but we write it as 1/ r\nm, where rmis\ncalled the speci \ufb01c membrane resistance. Conversely, the membrane resis- speci\ufb01cm e m b r a n e\nresistance r m tance Rmis equal to rmdivided by the surface area. When a neuron is in a\nresting state, the speci \ufb01c membrane resistance is around 1 M /Omega1\u00b7mm2. This\nnumber is much more variable than the speci \ufb01c membrane capacitance.\nMembrane resistances vary considerably among cells and under differentconditions and at different times for a given neuron, depending on thenumber, type, and state of its ion channels. For total surface areas between0.01 and 0.1 mm, the membrane resistance is typically in the range 10 to100 M\n/Omega1. With a 100 M /Omega1membrane resistance, a constant current of 0.1 nA\nis required to hold the membrane potential 10 mV away from its restingvalue.\nThe product of the membrane capacitance and the membrane resistance is\na quantity with the units of time called the membrane time constant,\n\u03c4m= membrane timeconstant\n\u03c4m RmCm. Because Cmand Rmhave inverse dependences on the membrane\nsurface area, the membrane time constant is independent of area and equalto the product of the speci \ufb01c membrane capacitance and resistance,\n\u03c4m=\nrmcm. The membrane time constant sets the basic time scale for changes\nin the membrane potential and typically falls in the range between 10 and100 ms.\nEquilibrium and Reversal Potentials\nElectric forces and diffusion are responsible for driving ions through chan-nel pores. Voltage differences between the exterior and interior of the cellproduce forces on ions. Negative membrane potentials attract positiveions into the neuron and repel negative ions. In addition, ions diffusethrough channels because the ion concentrations differ inside and outsidethe neuron. These differences are maintained by the ion pumps within thecell membrane. The concentrations of Na\n+and Ca2+are higher outside the\ncell than inside, so these ions are driven into the neuron by diffusion. K+\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.2 Electrical Properties of Neurons 7\nis more concentrated inside the neuron than outside, so it tends to diffuse\nout of the cell.\nIt is convenient to characterize the current \ufb02ow due to diffusion in terms\nof an equilibrium potential. This is de \ufb01ned as the membrane potential at equilibrium\npotential which current \ufb02ow due to electric forces cancels the diffusive \ufb02ow. For\nchannels that conduct a single type of ion, the equilibrium potential canbe computed easily. The potential difference across the cell membrane bi-ases the \ufb02ow of ions into or out of a neuron. Consider, for example, a\npositively charged ion and a negative membrane potential. In this case,the membrane potential opposes the \ufb02ow of ions out of the the cell. Ions\ncan only cross the membrane and leave the interior of the cell if they havesuf\ufb01cient thermal energy to overcome the energy barrier produced by the\nmembrane potential. If the ion has an electric charge zqwhere qis the\ncharge of one proton, it must have a thermal energy of at least\n\u2212zqV\nto cross the membrane (this is a positive energy for z>0 and V<0).\nThe probability that an ion has a thermal energy greater than or equal to\n\u2212zqV, when the temperature (on an absolute scale) is T,i se x p (zqV/kBT).\nThis is determined by integrating the Boltzmann distribution for energiesgreater than or equal to\n\u2212zqV. In molar units, this result can be written as\nexp(zFV/RT), which is equal to exp (zV/VT)by equation 5.1.\nThe biasing effect of the electrical potential can be overcome by an oppos-\ning concentration gradient. A concentration of ions inside the cell, [inside],that is suf \ufb01ciently greater than the concentration outside the cell, [outside],\ncan compensate for the Boltzmann probability factor. The rate at whichions\ufb02ow into the cell is proportional to [outside]. The \ufb02ow of ions out of\nthe cell is proportional to [inside] times the Boltzmann factor, because inthis direction only those ions that have suf \ufb01cient thermal energy can leave\nthe cell. The net \ufb02ow of ions will be zero when the inward and outward\n\ufb02ows are equal. We use the letter Eto denote the particular potential that\nsatis\ufb01es this balancing condition, which is then\n[outside]\n=[inside] exp (zE/VT). (5.3)\nSolving this equation for E,w e\ufb01nd Nernst equation\nE=VT\nzln/parenleftbigg[outside]\n[inside]/parenrightbigg\n. (5.4)\nEquation 5.4 is the Nernst equation. The reader can check that, if the result\nis derived for either sign of ionic charge or membrane potential, the resultis identical to 5.4, which thus applies in all cases. Equilibrium potentialsfor K\n+channels, labeled EK, typically fall in the range between -70 and\n-90 mV. Na+equilibrium potentials, ENa, are 50 mV or higher, and ECa\nfor Ca2+channels is higher still, around 150 mV. Finally, Cl\u2212equilibrium\npotentials are typically around -60 to -65 mV , near the resting potential ofmany neurons.\nThe Nernst equation (5.4) applies when the channels that generate a par-\nticular conductance allow only one type of ion to pass through them. Some\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nchannels are not so selective, and in this case the potential Eis not deter-\nmined by equation 5.4, but rather takes a value intermediate between theequilibrium potentials of the individual ion types that it conducts. An ap-proximate formula known as the Goldman equation (see Tuckwell, 1988;or Johnston and Wu, 1995) can be used to estimate Efor such conduc- Goldman equation\ntances. In this case, Eis often called a reversal potential, rather than anreversal potential\nequilibrium potential, because the direction of current \ufb02ow through the\nchannel switches as the membrane potential passes through E.\nA conductance with an equilibrium or reversal potential Etends to move\nthe membrane potential of the neuron toward the value E. When V\n>E\nthis means that positive current will \ufb02ow outward, and when V<Epos-\nitive current will \ufb02ow inward. Because Na+and Ca2+conductances have\npositive reversal potentials, they tend to depolarize a neuron (make its depolarization\nmembrane potential less negative). K+conductances, with their negative\nEvalues, normally hyperpolarize a neuron (make its membrane potential hyperpolarization\nmore negative). Cl\u2212conductances with reversal potentials near the resting\npotential, may pass little net current. Instead, their primary impact is tochange the membrane resistance of the cell. Such conductances are some-times called shunting, although all conductances \u2018shunt\u2019, that is, increase shunting\nconductances the total conductance of a neuron. Synaptic conductances are also charac-\nterized by reversal potentials and are termed excitatory or inhibitory onthis basis. Synapses with reversal potentials less than the threshold for ac-tion potential generation are typically called inhibitory, while those with inhibitory and\nexcitatory synapses more depolarizing reversal potentials are called excitatory.\nThe Membrane Current\nThe total current \ufb02owing across the membrane through all of its ion chan-\nnels is called the membrane current of the neuron. By convention, themembrane current is de \ufb01ned as positive when positive ions leave the neu-\nron and negative when positive ions enter the neuron. The total membranecurrent is determined by summing currents due to all of the different typesof channels within the cell membrane, including voltage-dependent andsynaptic channels. To facilitate comparisons between neurons of differ-ent sizes, it is convenient to use the membrane current per unit area of cellmembrane, which we call i\nm. The total membrane current is obtained from membrane current\nper unit area i m imby multipling it by Athe total surface area of the cell.\nWe label the different types of channels in a cell membrane with an index\ni. As discussed in the last section, the current carried by a set of channels\nof type iwith reversal potential Ei, vanishes when the membrane poten-\ntial satis \ufb01esV=Ei. For many types of channels, the current increases or\ndecreases approximately linearly when the membrane potential deviatesfrom this value. The difference V\n\u2212Eiis called the driving force, and the driving force\nconductance per\nunit area g imembrane current per unit area due to the type ichannels is written as\ngi(V\u2212Ei). The factor giis the conductance per unit area due to these\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.3 Single-Compartment Models 9\nchannels. Summing over the different types of channels, we obtain the\ntotal membrane current membrane current\nim=/summationdisplay\nigi(V\u2212Ei). (5.5)\nSometimes a more complicated expression called the Goldman-Hodgkin-\nKatz formula is used to relate the membrane current to giand membrane\npotential (see Tuckwell, 1988; or Johnston and Wu, 1995), but we will re-strict our discussion to the simpler relationship used in equation 5.5.\nMuch of the complexity and richness of neuronal dynamics arises because\nmembrane conductances change over time. However, some of the fac-tors that contribute to the total membrane current can be treated as rela-tively constant, and these are typically grouped together into a single termcalled the leakage current. The currents carried by ion pumps that main- leakage current\ntain the concentration gradients that make equilibrium potentials nonzerotypically fall into this category. For example, one type of pump uses theenergy of ATP hydrolysis to move three Na\n+ions out of the cell for every\ntwo K+ions it moves in. It is normally assumed that these pumps work at\nrelatively steady rates so that the currents they generate can be included ina time-independent leakage conductance. Sometimes, this assumption isdropped and explicit pump currents are modeled. In either case, all of thetime-independent contributions to the membrane current can be lumpedtogether into a single leakage term\ngL(V\u2212EL). Because this term hides\nmany sins, its reversal potential ELis not usually equal to the equilibrium\npotential of any speci \ufb01c ion. Instead it is often kept as a free parameter\nand adjusted to make the resting potential of the model neuron match that resting potential\nof the cell being modeled. Similarly, gLis adjusted to match the membrane\nconductance at rest. The line over the parameter gLis used to indicate that\nit has constant value. A similar notation is used later in this chapter todistinguish variable conductances from the \ufb01xed parameters that describe\nthem. The leakage conductance is called a passive conductance to distin-guish it from variable conductances that are termed active.\n5.3 Single-Compartment Models\nModels that describe the membrane potential of a neuron by a single vari-able Vare called single-compartment models. This chapter deals exclu-\nsively with such models. Multi-compartment models, which can describespatial variations in the membrane potential, are considered in chapter6. The equations for single-compartment models, like those of all neuronmodels, describe how charges \ufb02ow into and out of a neuron and affect its\nmembrane potential.\nEquation 5.2 provides the basic relationship that determines the mem-\nbrane potential for a single-compartment model. This equation states thatthe rate of change of the membrane potential is proportional to the rate\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nat which charge builds up inside the cell. The rate of charge buildup is,\nin turn, equal to the total amount of current entering the neuron. Therelevant currents are those arising from all the membrane and synapticconductances plus, in an experimental setting, any current injected intothe cell through an electrode. From equation 5.2, the sum of these currentsis equal to C\nmdV/dt, the total capacitance of the neuron times the rate of\nchange of the membrane potential. Because the membrane current is usu-ally characterized as a current per unit area, i\nm, it is more convenient to\ndivide this relationship by the surface area of the neuron. Then, the totalcurrent per unit area is equal to c\nmdV/dt, where cm=Cm/Ais the spe-\nci\ufb01c membrane capacitance. One complication in this procedure is that the\nelectrode current, Ieis not typically expressed as a current per unit area,\nso we must divide it by the total surface area of the neuron, A. Putting all single-\ncompartmentmodelthis together, the basic equation for all single-compartment models is\nc\nmdV\ndt=\u2212 im+Ie\nA. (5.6)\nBy convention, current that enters the neuron through an electrode is\nde\ufb01ned as positive-inward, whereas membrane current is de \ufb01ned as\npositive-outward. This explains the different signs for the currents inequation 5.6. The membrane current in equation 5.6 is determined by/C1/CT/D7 /DA /DA\n/BM/BM/BM/CE\n/CE/CV/D7\n\ua73c/C1/CT\n/BT\n/CR/D1\n/CV/C4\n/CV/BD\n/CV/BE/BX/D7\n/BX/C4\n/BX/BD\n/BX/BE\nFigure 5.4: The equivalent circuit for a one-compartment neuron model.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.4 Integrate-and-Fire Models 11\n5.4 Integrate-and-Fire Models\nA neuron will typically \ufb01re an action potential when its membrane poten-\ntial reaches a threshold value of about -55 to -50 mV. During the actionpotential, the membrane potential follows a rapid stereotyped trajectoryand then returns to a value that is hyperpolarized relative to the thresholdpotential. As we will see, the mechanisms by which voltage-dependentK\n+and Na+conductances produce action potentials are well-understood\nand can be modeled quite accurately. On the other hand, neuron modelscan be simpli \ufb01ed and simulations can be accelerated dramatically if the\nbiophysical mechanisms responsible for action potentials are not explic-itly included in the model. Integrate-and- \ufb01re models do this by stipulat- integrate and \ufb01re\nmodel ing that an action potential occurs whenever the membrane potential of\nthe model neuron reaches a threshold value V\nth. After the action poten-\ntial, the potential is reset to a value Vresetbelow the threshold potential,\nVreset<Vth.\nThe basic integrate-and- \ufb01re model was proposed by Lapicque in 1907,\nlong before the mechanisms that generate action potentials were under-stood. Despite its age and simplicity, the integrate-and- \ufb01re model is still an\nextremely useful description of neuronal activity. By avoiding a biophys-ical description of the action potential, integrate-and- \ufb01re models are left\nwith the simpler task of modeling only subthreshold membrane potentialdynamics. This can be done with various levels of rigor. In the simplestversion of these models, all active membrane conductances are ignored,including, for the moment, synaptic inputs, and the entire membrane con-ductance is modeled as a single passive leakage term, i\nm=gL(V\u2212EL).\nThis version is called the passive or leaky integrate-and- \ufb01re model. For\nsmall \ufb02uctuations about the resting membrane potential, neuronal con-\nductances are approximately constant, and the passive integrate-and- \ufb01re\nmodel assumes that this constancy holds over the entire subthresholdrange. For some neurons this is a reasonable approximation, and for oth-ers it is not. With these approximations, the model neuron behaves likean electric circuit consisting of a resistor and a capacitor in parallel ( \ufb01g-\nure 5.4), and the membrane potential is determined by equation 5.6 with\ni\nm=gL(V\u2212EL),\ncmdV\ndt=\u2212 gL(V\u2212EL)+Ie\nA. (5.7)\nIt is convenient to multiply equation 5.7 by the speci \ufb01c membrane resis-\ntance rm, which in this case is given by rm=1/gL. This cancels the factor of\ngLon the right side of the equation and leaves a factor cmrm=\u03c4mon the left\nside, where \u03c4mis the membrane time constant of the neuron. The electrode\ncurrent ends up being multiplied by rm/Awhich is the total membrane\nresistance Rm. Thus, the basic equation of the passive integrate-and- \ufb01re passive\nintegrate-and- \ufb01re\nmodelmodels is\n\u03c4mdV\ndt=EL\u2212V+RmIe. (5.8)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nTo generate action potentials in the model, equation 5.8 is augmented by\nthe rule that whenever Vreaches the threshold value Vth,a na c t i o np o -\ntential is \ufb01red and the potential is reset to Vreset. Equation 5.8 indicates\nthat when Ie=0, the membrane potential relaxes exponentially with time\nconstant \u03c4mtoV=EL.T h u s , ELis the resting potential of the model cell.\nThe membrane potential for the passive integrate-and- \ufb01re model is deter-\nmined by integrating equation 5.8 (a numerical method for doing this isdescribed in appendix A) and applying the threshold and reset rule foraction potential generation. The response of a passive integrate-and- \ufb01re\nmodel neuron to a time-varying electrode current is shown in \ufb01gure 5.5.\n-60-400\n-20\n4\n0\n100\nt (ms)200 300 400 500 0V (mV) Ie (nA)\nFigure 5.5: A passive integrate-and- \ufb01re model driven by a time-varying electrode\ncurrent. The upper trace is the membrane potential and the bottom trace the driv-ing current. The action potentials in this \ufb01gure are simply pasted onto the mem-\nbrane potential trajectory whenever it reaches the threshold value. The parametersof the model are E\nL=Vreset=\u2212 65 mV , Vth=\u2212 50 mV , \u03c4m=10 ms, and Rm=10\nM/Omega1.\nThe\ufb01ring rate of an integrate-and- \ufb01re model in response to a constant\ninjected current can be computed analytically. When Ieis independent of\ntime, the subthreshold potential V(t)can easily be computed by solving\nequation 5.8 and is\nV(t)=EL+RmIe+(V(0)\u2212EL\u2212RmIe)exp(\u2212t/\u03c4m) (5.9)\nwhere V(0)is the value of Vat time t=0. This solution can be checked\nsimply by substituting it into equation 5.8. It is valid for the integrate-and-\ufb01re model only as long as Vstays below the threshold. Suppose that at\nt\n=0, the neuron has just \ufb01red an action potential and is thus at the reset\npotential, so that V(0)=Vreset. The next action potential will occur when\nthe membrane potential reaches the threshold, that is, at a time t=tisi\nwhen\nV(tisi)=Vth=EL+RmIe+(Vreset\u2212EL\u2212RmIe)exp(\u2212tisi/\u03c4m). (5.10)\nBy solving this for tisi, the time of the next action potential, we can de-\ntermine the interspike interval for constant Ie, or equivalently its inverse,\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(Data in A from Ahmed et al., 1998, B fromMcCormick, 1990.)\nFigure 5.6A compares risias a function of Ie, using appropriate parame-\nter values, with data from current injection into a cortical neuron in vivo .\nThe\ufb01ring rate of the cortical neuron in \ufb01gure 5.6A has been de \ufb01ned as\nthe inverse of the interval between pairs of spikes. The rates determinedin this way using the \ufb01rst two spikes \ufb01red by the neuron in response to\nthe injected current ( \ufb01lled circles in \ufb01gure 5.6A) agree fairly well with the\nresults of the integrate-and- \ufb01re model with the parameters given in the\n\ufb01gure caption. However, the real neuron exhibits spike-rate adaptation, in spike-rate\nadaptation that the interspike intervals lengthen over time when a constant current\nis injected into the cell ( \ufb01gure 5.6B) before settling to a steady-state value.\nThe steady-state \ufb01ring rate in \ufb01gure 5.6A (open circles) could also be \ufb01tb y\nan integrate-and- \ufb01re model, but not using the same parameters as were\nused to \ufb01t the initial spikes. Spike-rate adaptation is a common feature of\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\ncortical pyramidal cells, and consideration of this phenomenon allows us\nto show how an integrate-and- \ufb01re model can be modi \ufb01ed to incorporate\nmore complex dynamics.\nSpike-Rate Adaptation and Refractoriness\nThe passive integrate-and- \ufb01re model that we have described thus far is\nbased on two separate approximations, a highly simpli \ufb01ed description of\nthe action potential and a linear approximation for the total membranecurrent. If details of the action potential generation process are not im-portant for a particular modeling goal, the \ufb01rst approximation can be re-\ntained while the membrane current is modeled in as much detail as is nec-essary. We will illustrate this process by developing a heuristic descriptionof spike-rate adaptation using a model conductance that has characteris-tics similar to measured neuronal conductances known to play importantroles in producing this effect.\nWe model spike-rate adaptation by including an additional current in the\nmodel,\n\u03c4mdV\ndt=EL\u2212V\u2212rmgsra(V\u2212EK)+RmIe. (5.13)\nThe spike-rate adaptation conductance gsrahas been modeled as a K+con-\nductance so, when activated, it will hyperpolarize the neuron, slowing anyspiking that may be occurring. We assume that this conductance relaxesto zero exponentially with time constant\n\u03c4srathrough the equation\n\u03c4sradgsra\ndt=\u2212 gsra. (5.14)\nWhenever the neuron \ufb01res a spike, gsrais increased by an amount /Delta1gsra,\nthat is, gsra\u2192gsra+/Delta1gsra. During repetitive \ufb01ring, the current builds up in\na sequence of steps causing the \ufb01ring rate to adapt. Figures 5.6B and 5.6C\ncompare the adapting \ufb01ring pattern of a cortical neuron with the output\nof the model.\nAs discussed in chapter 1, the probability of \ufb01ring for a neuron is signi \ufb01-\ncantly reduced for a short period of time after the appearance of an actionpotential. Such a refractory effect is not included in the basic integrate-and-\ufb01re model. The simplest way of including an absolute refractory pe-\nriod in the model is to add a condition to the basic threshold crossing ruleforbidding \ufb01ring for a period of time immediately after a spike. Refratori-\nness can be incorporated in a more realistic way by adding a conductancesimilar to the spike-rate adaptation conductance discussed above, but witha faster recovery time and a larger conductance increment following anaction potential. With a large increment, the current can essentially clampthe neuron to E\nKfollowing a spike, temporarily preventing further \ufb01ring\nand producing an absolute refractory period. As this conductance relaxes\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.5 Voltage-Dependent Conductances 15\nback to zero, \ufb01ring will be possible but initially less likely, producing a rel-\native refractory period. When recovery is completed, normal \ufb01ring can re-\nsume. Another scheme that is sometimes used to model refractory effectsis to raise the threshold for action potential generation following a spikeand then to allow it to relax back to its normal value. Spike-rate adapta-tion can also be described by using an integrated version of the integrate-and-\ufb01re model known as the spike-response model in which membrane\npotential wave forms are determined by summing pre-computed postsy-naptic potentials and after-spike hyperpolarizations. Finally, spike-rateadaptation and other effects can be incorporated into the integrate-and-\ufb01re framework by allowing the parameters\ngLand ELin equation 5.7 to\nvary with time.\n5.5 Voltage-Dependent Conductances\nMost of the interesting electrical properties of neurons, including theirability to \ufb01re and propagate action potentials, arise from nonlinearities\nassociated with active membrane conductances. Recordings of the current\ufb02owing through single channels indicate that channels \ufb02uctuate rapidly\nbetween open and closed states in a stochastic manner ( \ufb01gure 5.7). Models stochastic channel\nof membrane and synaptic conductances must describe how the probabil-ity that a channel is in an open, ion-conducting state at any given time de-pends on the membrane potential (for a voltage-dependent conductance), voltage-dependent,\nsynaptic, and\nCa\n2+-dependent\nconductancesthe presence or absence of a neurotransmitter (for a synaptic conduc-\ntance), or a number of other factors such as the concentration of Ca2+\nor other messenger molecules inside the cell. In this chapter, we con-sider two classes of active conductances, voltage-dependent membraneconductancesand transmitter-dependent synaptic conductances.An addi-tional type, the Ca\n2+-dependent conductance,is considered in chapter 6.\n400 300 200 100 00\n-8-4\nt (ms)current ( pA)channel\nclosed\nchannel\nopen\nFigure 5.7: Recording of the current passing through a single ion channel. This\nis a synaptic receptor channel sensitive to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Asmall amount of acetylcholine was applied to the preparation to produce occa-sional channel openings. In the open state, the channel passes 6.6 pA at a holdingpotential of -140 mV. This is equivalent to more than 10\n7charges per second pass-\ning through the channel and corresponds to an open channel conductance of 47pS. (From Hille, 1992.)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nIn a later section of this chapter, we discuss stochastic models of individ-\nual channels based on state diagrams and transition rates. However, mostneuron models use deterministic descriptions of the conductances arisingfrom many channels of a given type. This is justi \ufb01ed because of the large\nnumber of channels of each type in the cell membrane of a typical neuron.If large numbers of channels are present, and if they act independently ofeach other (which they do, to a good approximation), then, from the law oflarge numbers, the fraction of channels open at any given time is approx-imately equal to the probability that any one channel is in an open state.This allows us to move between single-channel probabilistic formulationsand macroscopic deterministic descriptions of membrane conductances.\nWe have denoted the conductance per unit area of membrane due to a set\nof ion channels of type ibyg\ni. The value of giat any given time is deter-\nmined by multiplying the conductance of an open channel by the densityof channels in the membrane and by the fraction of channels that are openat that time. The product of the \ufb01rst two factors is a constant called the\nmaximal conductance and denoted by\ngi. It is the conductance per unit\narea of membrane if all the channels of type iare open. Maximal conduc-\ntance parameters tend to range from \u00b5S/mm2to mS/mm2. The fraction\nof channels in the open state is equivalent to the probability of \ufb01nding any\ngiven channel in the open state, and it is denoted by Pi. Thus, gi=giPi. open probability P i\nThe dependence of a conductance on voltage, transmitter concentration,\nor other factors arises through effects on the open probability.\nThe open probability of a voltage-dependent conductance depends, as its\nname suggests, on the membrane potential of the neuron. In this chap-ter, we discuss models of two such conductances, the so-called delayed-recti\ufb01er K\n+and fast Na+conductances. The formalism we present, which\nis almost universally used to describe voltage-dependent conductances,was developed by Hodgkin and Huxley (1952) as part of their pioneeringwork showing how these conductances generate action potentials in thesquid giant axon. Other conductances are modeled in chapter 6.\nPersistent Conductances\nFigure 5.8 shows cartoons of the mechanisms by which voltage-dependentchannels open and close as a function of membrane potential. Channelsare depicted for two different types of conductances termed persistent ( \ufb01g-\nure 5.8A) and transient ( \ufb01gure 5.8B). We begin by discussing persistent\nconductances. Figure 5.8A shows a swinging gate attached to a voltagesensor that can open or close the pore of the channel. In reality, channel activation gate\ngating mechanisms involve complex changes in the conformational struc-ture of the channel, but the simple swinging gate picture is suf \ufb01cient if\nwe are only interested in the current carrying capacity of the channel. Achannel that acts as if it had a single type of gate (although, as we will see,this is actually modeled as a number of identical sub-gates), like the chan-nel in \ufb01gure 5.8A, produces what is called a persistent or noninactivating\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.5 Voltage-Dependent Conductances 17\nconductance. Opening of the gate is called activation of the conductance\nand gate closing is called deactivation. For this type of channel, the prob-ability that the gate is open, P\nK, increases when the neuron is depolarized\nand decreases when it is hyperpolarized. The delayed-recti \ufb01er K+conduc-\ntance that is responsible for repolarizing a neuron after an action potentialis such a persistent conductance.\nB\nactivation\ngate\ninactivation\ngate\nintracellular extracellular\nA\nlipid bilayer\naqueous\nporeselectivity\nfilter\nanchor\nproteinchannel\nproteinsensor\nintracellular extracellulargate\nFigure 5.8: Gating of membrane channels. In both \ufb01gures, the interior of the\nneuron is to the right of the membrane, and the extracellular medium is to the left.A) A cartoon of gating of a persistent conductance. A gate is opened and closed bya sensor that responds to the membrane potential. The channel also has a regionthat selectively allows ions of a particular type to pass through the channel, forexample, K\n+ions for a potassium channel. B) A cartoon of the gating of a transient\nconductance. The activation gate is coupled to a voltage sensor (denoted by acircled\n+) and acts like the gate in A. A second gate, denoted by the ball, can block\nthat channel once it is open. The top \ufb01gure shows the channel in a deactivated\n(and deinactivated) state. The middle panel shows an activated channel, and thebottom panel shows an inactivated channel. Only the middle panel correspondsto an open, ion-conducting state. (A from Hille, 1992; B from Kandel et al., 1991.)\nThe opening of the gate that describes a persistent conductance may in-\nvolve a number of conformational changes. For example, the delayed-recti\ufb01er K\n+conductance is constructed from four identical subunits, and\nit appears that all four must undergo a structural change for the channelto open. In general, if kindependent, identical events are required for a\nchannel to open, P\nKc a nb ew r i t t e na s\nPK=nk(5.15)\nwhere nis the probability that any one of the kindependent gating events\nhas occurred. Here, n, which varies between 0 and 1, is called a gating\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nor an activation variable, and a description of its voltage and time depen- activation variable\nn dence amounts to a description of the conductance. We can think of nas\nthe probability of an individual subunit gate being open, and 1 \u2212nas the\nprobability that it is closed.\nAlthough using the value of k=4 is consistent with the four subunit struc-\nture of the delayed-recti \ufb01er conductance, in practice kis an integer chosen\nto\ufb01t the data, and should be interpreted as a functional de \ufb01nition of a\nsubunit rather than a re \ufb02ection of a realistic structural model of the chan-\nnel. Indeed, the structure of the channel was not known at the time thatHodgkin and Huxley chose the form of equation 5.15 and suggested that\nk\n=4.\nWe describe the transition of each subunit gate by a simple kinetic\nscheme in which the gating transition closed \u2192open occurs at a voltage- channel kinetics\ndependent rate \u03b1n(V), and the reverse transition open \u2192closed occurs at\na voltage-dependent rate \u03b2n(V). The probability that a subunit gate opens\nover a short interval of time is proportional to the probability of \ufb01nding\nt h eg a t ec l o s e d ,1 \u2212n, multiplied by the opening rate \u03b1n(V). Likewise, the\nprobability that a subunit gate closes during a short time interval is pro-portional to the probability of \ufb01nding the gate open, n, multiplied by the\nclosing rate\n\u03b2n(V). The rate at which the open probability for a subunit\ngate changes is given by the difference of these two terms\ndn\ndt=\u03b1n(V)(1\u2212n)\u2212\u03b2n(V)n. (5.16)\nThe\ufb01rst term describes the opening process and the second term the clos-\ning process (hence the minus sign) that lowers the probability of being inthe con \ufb01guration with an open subunit gate. Equation 5.16 can be written\nin another useful form by dividing through by\n\u03b1n(V)+\u03b2n(V), gating equation\n\u03c4n(V)dn\ndt=n\u221e(V)\u2212n, (5.17)\nwhere \u03c4n(V)\n\u03c4n(V)=1\n\u03b1n(V)+\u03b2n(V)(5.18)\nand n\u221e(V)\nn\u221e(V)=\u03b1n(V)\n\u03b1n(V)+\u03b2n(V).

These are obtained by \ufb01tting ex-\nperimental data. It is useful to discuss the form that we expect these ratefunctions to take on the basis of thermodynamic arguments. The state\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.5 Voltage-Dependent Conductances 19\ntransitions described by \u03b1n, for example, are likely to be rate-limited by\nbarriers requiring thermal energy. These transitions involve the move-ment of charged components of the gate across part of the membrane, sothe height of these energy barriers should be affected by the membrane po-tential. The transition requires the movement of an effective charge, whichwe denote by qB\n\u03b1, through the potential V. This requires an energy qB\u03b1V.\nThe constant B\u03b1re\ufb02ects both the amount of charge being moved and the\ndistance over which it travels. The probability that thermal \ufb02uctuations\nwill provide enough energy to surmount this energy barrier is propor-tional to the Boltzmann factor, exp\n(\u2212qB\u03b1V/kBT). Based on this argument,\nwe expect \u03b1nto be of the form\n\u03b1n(V)=A\u03b1exp(\u2212qB\u03b1/kBT)=A\u03b1exp(\u2212B\u03b1V/VT) (5.20)\nfor some constant A\u03b1. The closing rate \u03b2nshould be expressed similarly,\nexcept with different constants A\u03b2and B\u03b2. From equation 5.19, we then\n\ufb01nd that n\u221e(V)is expected to be a sigmoidal function\nn\u221e(V)=1\n1+(A\u03b2/A\u03b1)exp((B\u03b1\u2212B\u03b2)V/VT). (5.21)\nFor a voltage-activated conductance, depolarization causes nto grow\ntoward one, and hyperpolarization causes them to shrink toward zero.Thus, we expect that the opening rate,\n\u03b1nshould be an increasing function\nofV(and thus B\u03b1<0) and \u03b2nshould be a decreasing function of V(and\nthus B\u03b2>0).

Not surprisingly, the resulting func-tional forms do not always \ufb01t the data and various alternatives are often\nemployed. The data upon which these \ufb01ts are based are typically obtained\nusing a technique called voltage clamping. In this techniques, an ampli \ufb01er voltage clamping\nis con \ufb01gured to inject the appropriate amount of electrode current to hold\nthe membrane potential at a constant value.

The dashed curves in \ufb01gure\n5.9 plot the formulas of equation 5.22.\nTransient Conductances\nSome channels only open transiently when the membrane potential is de-polarized because they are gated by two processes with opposite voltage-dependences. Figure 5.8B is a schematic of a channel that is controlled bytwo gates and generates a transient conductance. The swinging gate in \ufb01g-\nure 5.8B behaves exactly like the gate in \ufb01gure 5.8A. The probability that\nit is open is written as m\nkwhere mis an activation variable similar to n, activation\nvariable m and kis an integer. Hodgkin and Huxley used k=3 for their model of the\nfast Na+conductance. The ball in \ufb01gure 5.8B acts as the second gate. The\nprobability that the ball does not block the channel pore is written as hand\ncalled the inactivation variable. The activation and inactivation variables inactivation\nvariable h m and hare distinguished by having opposite voltage dependences. De-\npolarization causes mto increase and hto decrease, and hyperpolarization\ndecreases mwhile increasing h.\nFor the channel in \ufb01gure 5.8B to conduct, both gates must be open, and,\nassuming the two gates act independently, this has probability\nPNa=mkh, (5.23)\nThis is the general form used to describe the open probability for a tran-\nsient conductance. We could raise the hfactor in this expression to an\narbitrary power as we did for m, but we leave out this complication to\nstreamline the discussion. The activation mand inactivation h, like all gat-\ning variables, vary between zero and one.

Another class of conductances, the hyperpolarization-activated\nconductances, behave as if they are controlled solely by an inactivationgate. They are thus persistent conductances, but they open when the neu-ron is hyperpolarized rather than depolarized. The opening probabilityfor such channels is written solely of an inactivation variable similar to\nh. Strictly speaking these conductances deinactivate when they turn on\nand inactivate when they turn off. However, most people cannot bringthemselves to say deinactivate all the time, so they say instead that theseconductances are activated by hyperpolarization.\n5.6 The Hodgkin-Huxley Model\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley model for the generation of the action potential, inits single-compartment form, is constructed by writing the membrane cur-rent in equation 5.6 as the sum of a leakage current, a delayed-recti \ufb01ed K\n+\ncurrent and a transient Na+current,\nim=gL(V\u2212EL)+gKn4(V\u2212EK)+gNam3h(V\u2212ENa). (5.25)\nThe maximal conductances and reversal potentials used in the model are\ngL= 0.003 mS/mm2,gK= 0.036 mS/mm2,gNa= 1.2 mS/mm2,EL= -54.402\nmV , EK= -77 mV and ENa= 50 mV. The full model consists of equation 5.6\nwith equation 5.25 for the membrane current, and equations of the form5.17 for the gating variables n,m, and h. These equations can be integrated\nnumerically using the methods described in appendices A and B.\nThe temporal evolution of the dynamic variables of the Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel during a single action potential is shown in \ufb01gure 5.11. The ini-\ntial rise of the membrane potential, prior to the action potential, seen int h eu p p e rp a n e lo f \ufb01gure 5.11, is due to the injection of a positive elec-\ntrode current into the model starting at t\n=5 ms. When this current drives\nthe membrane potential up to about about -50 mV , the mvariable that\ndescribes activation of the Na+conductance suddenly jumps from nearly\nzero to a value near one. Initially, the hvariable, expressing the degree\nof inactivation of the Na+conductance, is around 0.6. Thus, for a brief\nperiod both mand hare signi \ufb01cantly different from zero. This causes a\nlarge in \ufb02ux of Na+ions producing the sharp downward spike of inward\ncurrent shown in the second trace from the top. The inward current pulsecauses the membrane potential to rise rapidly to around 50 mV (near theNa\n+equilibrium potential). The rapid increase in both Vand mis due\nto a positive feedback effect. Depolarization of the membrane potentialcauses mto increase, and the resulting activation of the Na\n+conductance\ncauses Vto increase. The rise in the membrane potential causes the Na+\nconductance to inactivate by driving htoward zero. This shuts off the Na+\ncurrent. In addition, the rise in Vactivates the K+conductance by driving\nntoward one. This increases the K+current which drives the membrane\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Methods for constructing such a model, andresults from it, are described in chapter 6.\n5.7 Modeling Channels\nIn previous sections, we described the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism fordescribing voltage-dependent conductances arising from a large numberof channels. With the advent of single channel studies, microscopic de-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n24 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nscriptions of the transitions between the conformational states of channel\nmolecules have been developed. Because these models describe complexmolecules, they typically involve many states and transitions. Here, wediscuss simple versions of these models that capture the spirit of single-channel modeling without getting mired in the details.\nModels of single channels are based on state diagrams that indicate the\npossible conformational states that the channel can assume. Typically, oneof the states in the diagram is designated as open and ion-conducting,while the other states are non-conducting. The current conducted by thechannel is written as\ngP(V\u2212E), where Eis the reversal potential, gis the\nsingle-channel open conductance and Pis one whenever the open state is\noccupied and zero otherwise. Channel models can be instantiated directlyfrom state diagrams simply by keeping track of the state of the channeland allowing stochastic changes of state to occur at appropriate transitionrates. If the model is updated in short time steps of duration\n/Delta1t, the prob-\nability that the channel makes a given transition during an update intervalis the transition rate times\n/Delta1t.5pA0.5pA10ms50pA\n1 channel 10 channels 100 channels1\nclosed2\nclosed3\nclosed4\nclosed5\nopen4\u03b1n 3\u03b1n 2\u03b1n\u03b1n\n4\u03b2n 3\u03b2n 2\u03b2n \u03b2n\nFigure 5.12: A model of the delayed-recti \ufb01er K+channel. The upper diagram\nshows the states and transition rates of the model. In the simulations shown in thelower panels, the membrane potential was initially held at -100 mV , then held at 10mV for 20 ms, and \ufb01nally returned to a holding potential of -100 mV . The smooth\ncurves in these panels show the membrane current predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxley model in this situation. The left panel shows a simulation of a single chan-nel that opened several times during the depolarization. The middle panel showsthe total current from 10 simulated channels and the right panel corresponds to100 channels. As the number of channels increases, the Hodgkin-Huxley modelprovides a more accurate description of the current.\nFigure 5.12 shows the state diagram and simulation results for a model of\na single delayed-recti \ufb01er K+channel that is closely related to the Hodgkin-\nHuxley description of the macroscopic delayed-recti \ufb01er conductance.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.7 Modeling Channels 25\nure 5.12 are the voltage-dependent rate functions of the Hodgkin-Huxley\nmodel. The model uses the same four subunit structure assumed in theHodgkin-Huxley model. We can think of state 1 in this diagram as a statein which all the subunit gates are closed. States 2, 3, 4, and 5 have 1, 2, 3,and 4 open subunit gates respectively. State 5 is the sole open state. Thefactors of 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the transition rates in \ufb01gure 5.12 correspond to\nthe number of subunit gates that can make a given transition. For exam-ple, the transition rate from state 1 to state 2 is four times faster than therate from state 4 to state 5. This is because any one of the 4 subunit gatescan open to get from state 1 to state 2, but the transition from state 4 tostate 5 requires the single remaining closed subunit gate to open.\nThe lower panels in \ufb01gure 5.12 show simulations of this model involving\n1, 10, and 100 channels. The sum of currents from all of these channelsis compared with the current predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxley model(scaled by the appropriate maximal conductance). For each channel, thepattern of opening and closing is random, but when enough channels aresummed, the total current matches that of the Hodgkin-Huxley modelquite well.\nTo see how the channel model in \ufb01gure 5.12 reproduces the results of\nthe Hodgkin-Huxley model when the currents from many channels aresummed, we must consider a probabilistic description of the channelmodel. We denote the probability that a channel is in state aof\ufb01gure\n5.12 by p\na, with a=1,2,..., 5. Dynamic equations for these probabilities\nare easily derived by setting the rate of change for a given paequal to the\nprobability per unit time of entry into state afrom other states minus the\nrate for leaving a state. The entry probability per unit time is the productof the appropriate transition rate times the probability that the state mak-ing the transition is occupied. The probability per unit time for leaving is\np\natimes the sum of all the rates for possible transitions out of the state.\nFollowing this reasoning, the equations for the state probabilities are\ndp1\ndt=\u03b2np2\u22124\u03b1np1 (5.26)\ndp2\ndt=4\u03b1np1+2\u03b2np3\u2212(\u03b2n+3\u03b1n)p2\ndp3\ndt=3\u03b1np2+3\u03b2np4\u2212(2\u03b2n+2\u03b1n)p3\ndp4\ndt=2\u03b1np3+4\u03b2np5\u2212(3\u03b2n+\u03b1n)p4\ndp5\ndt=\u03b1np4\u22124\u03b2np5.\nA solution for these equations can be constructed if we recall that, in the\nHodgkin-Huxley model, nis the probability of a subunit gate being in the\nopen state and 1 \u2212nthe probability of it being closed. If we use that same\nnotation here, state 1 has 4 closed subunit gates, and thus p1=(1\u2212n)4.\nState 5, the open state, has 4 open subunit gates so p5=n4=P. State\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\n2 has one open subunit gate, which can be any one of the four subunit\ngates, and three closed states making p2=4n(1\u2212n)3. Similar arguments\nyield p3=6n2(1\u2212n)2and p4=4n3(1\u2212n). These expressions generate a\nsolution to the above equations provided that nsatis\ufb01es equation 5.16, as\nthe reader can verify.\nIn the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the Na+conductance, the activation and\ninactivation processes are assumed to act independently. The schematicin\ufb01gure 5.8B, which cartoons the mechanism believed to be responsible\nfor inactivation, suggests that this assumption is incorrect. The ball thatinactivates the channel is located inside the cell membrane where it cannotbe affected directly by the potential across the membrane. Furthermore, inthis scheme, the ball cannot occupy the channel pore until the activationgate has opened, making the two processes inter-dependent.\n50pA\n5ms0.5pA\n5pA1 channel 10 channels 100 channels1\nclosed2\nclosed3\nclosed4\nopen5\ninactv3\u03b2m 2\u03b2m \u03b2m3\u03b1m 2\u03b1m \u03b1m\n\u03b1hk1\nk2k3\nFigure 5.13: A model of the fast Na+channel.

The\nsmooth curves in these panels show the current predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxleymodel in this situation. The left panel shows a simulation of a single channel thatopened once during the depolarization. The middle panel shows the total currentfrom 10 simulated channels and the right panel corresponds to 100 channels. Asthe number of channels increases, the Hodgkin-Huxley model provides a fairlyaccurate description of the current, but it is not identical to the channel model inthis case.\nThe state diagram in \ufb01gure 5.13 re \ufb02ects this by having a state-dependent,\nvoltage-independent inactivation mechanism. This diagram is a simpli- state-dependent\ninactivation \ufb01ed version of a Na+channel model due to Patlak (1991).

The transition to theinactivated state 5, however, is quite different from the inactivation pro-cess in the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Inactivation transitions to state 5 canonly occur from states 2, 3, and 4, and the corresponding transition rates\nk\n1,k2, and k3are constants, independent of voltage. The deinactivation\nprocess occurs at the Hodgkin-Huxley rate \u03b1h(V)from state 5 to state 3.\nFigure 5.13 shows simulations of this Na+channel model. In contrast to\nthe K+channel model shown in \ufb01gure 5.12, this model does not repro-\nduce exactly the results of the Hodgkin-Huxley model when large num-bers of channels are summed. Nevertheless, the two models agree quitewell, as seen in the lower right panel of \ufb01gure 5.13. The agreement, de-\nspite the different mechanisms of inactivation, is due to the speed of theactivation process for the Na\n+conductance. The inactivation rate func-\ntion\u03b2h(V)in the Hodgkin-Huxley model has a sigmoidal form similar\nto the asymptotic activation function m\u221e(V)(see equation 5.24). This is\nindicative of the actual dependence of inactivation on mand not V.H o w -\never, the activation variable mof the Hodgkin-Huxley model reaches its\nvoltage-dependent asymptotic value m\u221e(V)so rapidly that it is dif \ufb01cult\nto distinguish inactivation processes that depend on mfrom those that de-\npend on V. Differences between the two models are only apparent during\na sub-millisecond time period while the conductance is activating. Exper-iments that can resolve this time scale support the channel model over theoriginal Hodgkin-Huxley description.\n5.8 Synaptic Conductances\nSynaptic transmission at a spike-mediated chemical synapse begins whenan action potential invades the presynaptic terminal and activates voltage-dependent Ca\n2+channels leading to a rise in the concentration of Ca2+\nwithin the terminal. This causes vesicles containing transmitter moleculesto fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the synapticcleft between the pre- and postsynaptic sides of the synapse. The trans-mitter molecules then diffuse across the cleft and bind to receptors onthe postsynaptic neuron. Binding of transmitter molecules leads to theopening of ion channels that modify the conductance of the postsynap-tic neuron, completing the transmission of the signal from one neuron tothe other. Postsynaptic ion channels can be activated directly by bindingto the transmitter, or indirectly when the transmitter binds to a distinct re-ceptor that affects ion channels through an intracellular second-messengersignaling pathway.\nAs with a voltage-dependent conductance, a synaptic conductance can be\nwritten as the product of a maximal conductance and an open channelprobability, g\ns=gsP. The open probability for a synaptic conductance can\nbe expressed as a product of two terms that re \ufb02ect processes occurring on\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nthe pre- and postsynaptic sides of the synapse, P=PsPrel. The factor Psis synaptic open\nprobability P s the probability that a postsynaptic channel opens given that the transmit-ter was released by the presynaptic terminal. Because there are typicallymany postsynaptic channels, this can also be taken as the fraction of chan-nels opened by the transmitter.\nP\nrelis related to the probability that transmitter is released by the presy-\nnaptic terminal following the arrival of an action potential. This re \ufb02ects the transmitter release\nprobability P rel fact that transmitter release is a stochastic process. Release of transmitterat a presynaptic terminal does not necessarily occur every time an actionpotential arrives, and, conversely, spontaneous release can occur even inthe absence of action potential induced depolarization. The interpretationofP\nrelis a bit subtle because a synaptic connection between neurons may\ninvolve multiple anatomical synapses, and each of these may have multi-ple independent transmitter release sites. The factor P\nrel, in our discussion,\nis the average of the release probabilities at each release site. If there aremany release sites, the total amount of transmitter released by all the sitesis proportional to P\nrel. If there is a single release site, Prelis the probabil-\nity that it releases transmitter. We will restrict our discussion to these twointerpretations of P\nrel. For a modest number of release sites with widely\nvarying release probabilities, the current we discuss only describes an av-erage over multiple trials.\nSynapses can exert their effects on the soma, dendrites, axon spike-\ninitiation zone, or presynaptic terminals of their postsynaptic targets.There are two broad classes of synaptic conductances that are distin-guished by whether the transmitter binds to the synaptic channel and acti-vates it directly, or the transmitter binds to a distinct receptor that activates ionotropic synapse\nthe conductance indirectly through an intracellular signaling pathway.metabotropic\nsynapseThe\ufb01rst class is called ionotropic and the second metabotropic. Ionotropic\nconductances activate and deactivate more rapidly than metabotropic con-ductances. Metabotropic receptors can, in addition to opening chan-nels, cause long-lasting changes inside a neuron. They typically operatethrough pathways that involve G-protein mediated receptors and vari-ous intracellular signalling molecules known as second messengers. Alarge number of neuromodulators including serotonin, dopamine, nore-pinephrine, and acetylcholine can act through metabotropic receptors.These have a wide variety of important effects on the functioning of thenervous system.\nGlutamate and GABA (\n\u03b3-aminobutyric acid) are the major excitatory glutamate, GABA\nand inhibitory transmitters in the brain. Both act ionotropically andmetabotropically. The principal ionotropic receptor types for glutamateare called AMPA and NMDA. Both AMPA and NMDA receptors produce AMP A, NMDA\nmixed-cation conductances with reversal potentials around 0 mV. TheAMPA current is fast activating and deactivating. The NMDA receptoris somewhat slower to activate and deactivates considerably more slowly.In addition, NMDA receptors have an unusual voltage dependence thatwe discuss in a later section, and are rather more permeable to Ca\n2+than\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5.8 Synaptic Conductances 29\nAMPA receptors.\nGABA activates two important inhibitory synaptic conductances in the GABA A, GABA B\nbrain. GABA Areceptors produce a relatively fast ionotropic Cl\u2212conduc-\ntance. GABA Breceptors are metabotropic and act to produce a slower and\nlonger lasting K+conductance.\nIn addition to chemical synapses, neurons can be coupled through electri-\ncal synapses (gap junctions) that produce a synaptic current proportional gap junctions\nto the difference between the pre- and postsynaptic membrane potentials.Some gap junctions rectify so that positive and negative current \ufb02ow is not\nequal for potential differences of the same magnitude.\nThe Postsynaptic Conductance\nIn a simple model of a directly activated receptor channel, the transmitterinteracts with the channel through a binding reaction in which ktransmit-\nter molecules bind to a closed receptor and open it. In the reverse reaction,the transmitter molecules unbind from the receptor and it closes. Theseprocesses are analogous to the opening and closing involved in the gatingof a voltage-dependent channel, and the same type of equation is used todescribe how the open probability P\nschanges with time,\ndPs\ndt=\u03b1s(1\u2212Ps)\u2212\u03b2sPs. (5.27)\nHere, \u03b2sdetermines the closing rate of the channel and is usually as-\nsumed to be a constant. The opening rate, \u03b1s, on the other hand, de-\npends on the concentration of transmitter available for binding to the re-ceptor. If the concentration of transmitter at the site of the synaptic channelis [transmitter], the probability of \ufb01nding ktransmitter molecules within\nbinding range of the channel is proportional to [transmitter]\nk, and \u03b1sis\nsome constant of proportionality times this factor.\nWhen an action potential invades the presynaptic terminal, the transmitter\nconcentration rises and \u03b1sgrows rapidly causing Psto increase. Follow-\ning the release of transmitter, diffusion out of the cleft, enzyme-mediateddegradation, and presynaptic uptake mechanisms can all contribute to arapid reduction of the transmitter concentration. This sets\n\u03b1sto zero, and\nPsfollows suit by decaying exponentially with a time constant 1 /\u03b2s.T y p i -\ncally, the time constant for channel closing is considerably larger than theopening time.\nAs a simple model of transmitter release, we assume that the transmit-\nter concentration in the synaptic cleft rises extremely rapidly after vesiclerelease, remains at a high value for a period of duration T, and then falls\nrapidly to zero. Thus, the transmitter concentration is modeled as a squarepulse. While the transmitter concentration is nonzero,\n\u03b1stakes a constant\nvalue much greater that \u03b2s, otherwise \u03b1s=0. Suppose that vesicle release\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n30 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\noccurs at time t=0 and that the synaptic channel open probability takes\nthe value Ps(0)at this time. While the transmitter concentration in the cleft\nis nonzero, \u03b1sis so much larger than \u03b2sthat we can ignore the term involv-\ning\u03b2sin equation 5.27. Integrating equation 5.27 under this assumption,\nwe\ufb01nd that\nPs(t)=1+(Ps(0)\u22121)exp(\u2212\u03b1st)for 0 \u2264t\u2264T. (5.28)\nThe open probability takes its maximum value at time t=Tand then, for\nt\u2265T, decays exponentially at a rate determined by the constant \u03b2s,\nPs(t)=Ps(T)exp(\u2212\u03b2s(t\u2212T))for t\u2265T. (5.29)\nIfPs(0)=0, as it will if there is no synaptic release immediately before the\nrelease at t=0, equation 5.28 simpli \ufb01es to Ps(t)=1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b1st)for 0\u2264\nt\u2264T, and this reaches a maximum value Pmax=Ps(T)=1\u2212exp(\u2212\u03b1sT).\nIn terms of this parameter, a simple manipulation of equation 5.28 showsthat we can write, in the general case,\nP\ns(T)=Ps(0)+Pmax(1\u2212Ps(0)). (5.30)\nFigure 5.14 shows a \ufb01t to a recorded postsynaptic current using this for-\nmalism. In this case, \u03b2swas set to 0.19 ms\u22121. The transmitter concentra-\ntion was modeled as a square pulse of duration T=1 ms during which\n\u03b1s=0.93 ms\u22121. Inverting these values, we \ufb01nd that the time constant de-\ntermining the rapid rise seen in \ufb01gure 5.14A is 0.9 ms, while the fall of the\ncurrent is an exponential with a time constant of 5.26 ms.\n10ms60pA\nFigure 5.14: A\ufb01t of the model discussed in the text to the average EPSC (exci-\ntatory postsynaptic current) recorded from mossy \ufb01ber input to a CA3 pyramidal\ncell in a hippocampal slice preparation.

In this case, the synaptic conductance\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The synaptic conductance\ndue to a sequence of action potentials at arbitrary times can be modeledby allowing P\nsto decay exponentially to zero according to the equation\n\u03c4sdPs\ndt=\u2212 Ps, (5.31)\nand, on the basis of the equation 5.30, making the replacement\nPs\u2192Ps+Pmax(1\u2212Ps) (5.32)\nimmediately after each presynaptic action potential.\nEquations 5.28 and 5.29 can also be used to model synapses with slower\nrise times, but other functional forms are often used. One way of describ-ing both the rise and the fall of a synaptic conductance is to express P\nsas\nthe difference of two exponentials (see the GABA Aand NMDA traces in\n\ufb01gure 5.15). For an isolated presynaptic action potential occurring at t=0,\nthe synaptic conductance is written as\nPs=PmaxB/parenleftbig\nexp(\u2212t/\u03c41)\u2212exp(\u2212t/\u03c42)/parenrightbig\n(5.33)\nwhere \u03c41>\u03c4 2, and Bis a normalization factor that assures that the peak\nvalue of Psis equal to one,\nB=/parenleftBigg/parenleftbigg\u03c42\n\u03c41/parenrightbigg\u03c4rise/\u03c41\n\u2212/parenleftbigg\u03c42\n\u03c41/parenrightbigg\u03c4rise/\u03c42/parenrightBigg\u22121\n.

The fact that the opening of NMDA re-\nceptor channels requires both pre- and postsynaptic depolarization meansthat they can act as coincidence detectors of simultaneous pre- and postsy- coincidence\ndetection naptic activity. This plays an important role in connection with the Hebb\nrule for synaptic modi \ufb01cation discussed in chapter 8.\nRelease Probability and Short-Term Plasticity\nThe probability of transmitter release and the magnitude of the resulting\nconductance change in the postsynaptic neuron can depend on the historyof activity at a synapse. The effects of activity on synaptic conductancesare termed short- and long-term. Short-term plasticity refers to a number short-term\nplasticity of phenomena that affect the probability that a presynaptic action poten-\ntial opens postsynaptic channels and that last anywhere from millisecondsto tens of seconds. The effects of long-term plasticity are extremely persis- long-term\nplasticity tent, lasting, for example, as long as the preparation being studied can\nbe kept alive. The modeling and implications of long-term plasticity areconsidered in chapter 8. Here we describe a simple way of describingshort-term synaptic plasticity as a modi \ufb01cation in the release probability\nfor synaptic transmission. Short-term modi \ufb01cations of synaptic transmis-\nsion can involve other mechanisms than merely changes in the probabilityof transmission, but for simplicity we absorb all these effects into a modi \ufb01-\ncation of the factor P\nrelintroduced previously. Thus, Prelcan be interpreted\nmore generally as a presynaptic factor affecting synaptic transmission.\nFigure 5.17 illustrates two principal types of short-term plasticity, depres-\nsion and facilitation. Figure 5.17A shows trial-averaged postsynaptic cur- depression\nfacilitation rent pulses produced in one cortical pyramidal neuron by evoking a reg-\nular series of action potentials in a second pyramidal neuron presynapticto the \ufb01rst. The pulses decrease in amplitude dramatically upon repeated\nactivation of the synaptic conductance, revealing short-term synaptic de-pression. Figure 5.17B shows a similar series of averaged postsynaptic cur-rent pulses recorded in a cortical inhibitory interneuron when a sequenceof action potentials was evoked in a presynaptic pyramidal cell. In thiscase, the amplitude of the pulses increases, and thus the synapse facili-tates. In general, synapses can exhibit facilitation and depression over avariety of time scales, and multiple components of short-term plasticitycan be found at the same synapse. To keep the discussion simple, we con-sider synapses that exhibit either facilitation or depression described by asingle time constant.\nFacilitation and depression can both be modeled as presynaptic processes\nthat modify the probability of transmitter release. We describe them usinga simple non-mechanistic model that has similarities to the model of P\ns\npresented in the previous subsection. For both facilitation and depression,\nthe release probability after a long period of presynaptic silence is Prel=P0.\nActivity at the synapse causes Prelto increase in the case of facilitation\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\n100 ms0.4 mV1.5 mV\n100 msA B\nFigure 5.17: Depression and facilitation of excitatory intracortical synapses.

In this case, the\nparameter fD(with 0 \u2264fD\u22641) controls the amount of depression, and the\nfactor Prelprevents the release probability from becoming negative.\nWe begin by analyzing the effects of facilitation on synaptic transmission\nfor a presynaptic spike train with Poisson statistics. In particular, we com-pute the average release probability, denoted by\n/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright./angbracketleftPrel/angbracketrightis determined\nby requiring that the facilitation that occurs after each presynaptic actionpotential is exactly canceled by the average exponential decrement thatoccurs between presynaptic spikes. Consider two presynaptic action po-tentials separated by an interval\n\u03c4, and suppose that the release probability\ntakes its average value value /angbracketleftPrel/angbracketrightat the time of the \ufb01rst spike. Immedi-\nately after this spike, it is augmented to /angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright+fF(1\u2212/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright).B yt h et i m e\nof the second spike, this will have decayed to P0+(/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright+fF(1\u2212/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright)\u2212\nP0)exp(\u2212\u03c4/\u03c4 P), which is obtained by integrating equation 5.37.

The dashed curve shows the\nrise of the average release probability as the presynaptic rate increases. The solidcurve is the average rate of transmission, which is the average release probabilitytimes the presynaptic \ufb01ring rate.

The only difference from the above deriva-tion is that following a presynaptic spike\n/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketrightis decreased to fD/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright.\nThus, the consistency condition 5.39 is replaced by\n/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright=P0+(fD/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright\u2212P0)r\u03c4P\n1+r\u03c4P(5.41)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n36 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\ngiving\n/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketright=P0\n1+(1\u2212fD)r\u03c4P(5.42)\nThis equals P0at low rates and goes to zero as 1 /rat high rates ( \ufb01gure\n5.18B), which has some interesting consequences. As noted above, the av-erage rate of successful synaptic transmissions is equal to\n/angbracketleftPrel/angbracketrighttimes the\npresynaptic rate r. Because /angbracketleftPrel/angbracketrightis proportional to 1 /rat high rates, the av-\nerage transmission rate is independent of rin this range. This can be seen\nby the \ufb02attening of the solid curve in \ufb01gure 5.18B. As a result, synapses\nthat depress do not convey information about the values of constant, highpresynaptic \ufb01ring rates to their postsynaptic targets.

Note \ufb01rst that the transmis-\nsion rates during the 25, 100, 10 and 40 Hz periods are quite similar. Thisis a consequence of the 1\n/rdependence of the average release probability,\nas discussed above. The largest transmission rates in the \ufb01gure occur dur-\ning the sharp upward transitions between different presynaptic rates. Thisillustrates the important point that depressing synapses amplify transientsignals relative to steady-state inputs. The transients corresponding the 25to 100 Hz transition and the 10 to 40 Hz transition are of roughly equalamplitudes, but the transient for the 10 to 40 Hz transition is broader thanthat for the 25 to 100 Hz transition.\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1200 1000 800 600 400 200 0\nt  (ms)25 Hz 100 Hz 10 Hz 40 Hz/CW /C8\n/D6/CT/D0/CX /D6 /B4/C0/DE/B5\nFigure 5.19: The average rate of transmission for a synapse with depression when\nthe presynaptic \ufb01ring rate changes in a sequence of steps.

The size of the change in the\ntransmission rate is thus proportional to /Delta1r/r, which means that depress-\ning synapses not only amplify transient inputs, they transmit them in ascaled manner. The amplitude of the transient transmission rate is propor-tional to the fractional change, not the absolute change, in the presynaptic\ufb01ring rate. The two transients seen in \ufb01gure 5.19 have similar amplitudes\nbecause in both cases\n/Delta1r/r=3. The difference in the recovery time for\nthe two upward transients in \ufb01gure 5.19 is due to the fact that the effec-\ntive time constant governing the recovery to a new steady-state level ris\n\u03c4P/(1+(1\u2212fD)\u03c4Pr).\n5.9 Synapses On Integrate-and-Fire Neurons\nSynaptic inputs can be incorporated into an integrate-and- \ufb01re model by\nincluding synaptic conductances in the membrane current appearing inequation 5.8,\n\u03c4mdV\ndt=EL\u2212V\u2212rmgsPs(V\u2212Es)+RmIe. (5.43)\nFor simplicity, we assume that Prel=1 in this example. The synaptic cur-\nrent is multiplied by rmin equation 5.43 because equation 5.8 was multi-\nplied by this factor. To model synaptic transmission, Pschanges whenever\nthe presynaptic neuron \ufb01res an action potential using one of the schemes\ndescribed previously.\nFigures 5.20A and 5.20B show examples of two integrate-and- \ufb01re neu-\nrons driven by electrode currents and connected by identical excitatoryor inhibitory synapses. The synaptic conductances in this example aredescribed by the\n\u03b1function model. This means that the synaptic conduc-\ntance a time tafter the occurrence of a presynaptic action potential is given\nbyPs=(t/\u03c4s)exp(\u2212t/\u03c4s).T h e \ufb01gure shows a non-intuitive effect. When\nthe synaptic time constant is suf \ufb01ciently long ( \u03c4s= 10 ms in this exam-\nple), excitatory connections produce a state in which the two neurons \ufb01re\nalternately, out of phase with each other, while inhibitory synapses pro-duce synchronous \ufb01ring. It is normally assumed that excitation produces synchronous and\nasynchronous\n\ufb01ringsynchrony. Actually, inhibitory connections can be more effective in some\ncases than excitatory connections at synchronizing neuronal \ufb01ring.\nSynapses have multiple effects on their postsynaptic targets. In equation\n5.43, the term r\nmgsPsEsacts as a source of current to the neuron, while the\nterm rmgsPsVchanges the membrane conductance. The effects of the latter\nterm are referred to as shunting, and they can be identi \ufb01ed most easily if\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n38 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\n1\n20\n-20\n-40\n-60\n20 40 60 80 100 0-80\n0\n-20\n-40-60\n2040 60 80 100 0-80\nt (ms)V1 (mV) V2 (mV)\nV1 (mV) V2 (mV)0\n-20\n-40-60\n20 40 60 80 1000-80\n0\n-20\n-40-60\n2040 60 80 100 0-80\nt (ms)A B\n1\n2Ie Ie\nIe Ie\nFigure 5.20: Two synaptically coupled integrate-and- \ufb01re neurons.

However, shuntingonly has a divisive effect on the membrane potential of an integrate-and-\ufb01re neuron; its effect on the \ufb01ring rate is subtractive. To see this, assume\nthat synaptic input is arriving at a suf \ufb01cient rate to maintain a relatively\nconstant value of P\ns.

In order to keep the \ufb01ring rates from differing too greatly between\nthese two examples, the value of the reset voltage is higher in B than in A.\nRegular and Irregular Firing Modes\nIntegrate-and- \ufb01re models are useful for studying how neurons sum large\nnumbers of synaptic inputs and how networks of neurons interact. Oneissue that has received considerable attention is the degree of variabilityin the \ufb01ring output of integrate-and- \ufb01re neurons receiving synaptic input.\nThis work has led to the realization that neurons can respond to multi-ple synaptic inputs in two different modes of operation depending on thebalance that exists between excitatory and inhibitory contributions.\nThe two modes of operation are illustrated in \ufb01gure 5.21, which shows\nmembrane potentials of an integrate-and- \ufb01re model neuron responding to\n1000 excitatory and 200 inhibitory inputs. Each input consists of an inde-pendent Poisson spike train driving a synaptic conductance. The upperpanels of \ufb01gure 5.21 show the membrane potential with the action po-\ntential generation mechanism of the model turned off, and \ufb01gures 5.21A\nand 5.21B illustrate the two different modes of operation. In \ufb01gure 5.21A,\nthe effect of the excitatory inputs is strong enough, relative to that of theinhibitory inputs, to make the average membrane potential, when actionpotential generation is blocked, more depolarized than the spiking thresh-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n40 Model Neurons I: Neuroelectronics\nold of the model (the dashed line in the \ufb01gure). When the action poten-\ntial mechanism is turned on (lower panel of \ufb01gure 5.21A), this produces a\nfairly regular pattern of action potentials.\nThe irregularity of a spike train can be quanti \ufb01ed using the coef \ufb01cient of\nvariation ( CV), the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the in-\nterspike intervals (see chapter 1). For the Poisson inputs being used inthis example, C\nV= 1, while for the spike train in the lower panel of \ufb01gure\n5.21A, CV= 0.3. Thus, the output spike train is much more regular than the\ninput trains. This is not surprising, because the model neuron effectivelyaverages its many synaptic inputs. In the regular \ufb01ring mode, the total\nsynaptic input attempts to charge the neuron above the threshold, but ev-ery time the potential reaches the threshold it gets reset and starts chargingagain. In this mode of operation, the timing of the action potentials is de-termined primarily by the charging rate of the cell, which is controlled byits membrane time constant.\nFigure 5.21B shows the other mode of operation that produces an irreg-\nular\ufb01ring pattern. In the irregular \ufb01ring mode, the average membrane\npotential is more hyperpolarized than the threshold for action potentialgeneration (upper panel of \ufb01gure 5.21B). Action potentials are only gener-\nated when there is a \ufb02uctuation in the total synaptic input strong enough\nto make the membrane potential reach the threshold. This produces anirregular spike train, such as that seen in the lower panel of \ufb01gure 5.21B\nwhich has a C\nVvalue of 0.84.\nThe high degree of variability seen in the spiking patterns of in vivo record-\nings of cortical neurons (see chapter 1) suggests that they are better ap-proximated by an integrate-and- \ufb01re model operating in an irregular- \ufb01ring\nmode. There are advantages to operating in the irregular- \ufb01ring mode that\nmay compensate for its increased variability. One is that neurons \ufb01ring\nin the irregular mode re \ufb02ect in their outputs the temporal properties of\n\ufb02uctuations in their total synaptic input. In the regular \ufb01ring mode, the\ntiming of output spikes is only weakly related to the temporal characterof the input spike trains. In addition, neurons operating in the irregular\ufb01ring mode can respond more quickly to changes in presynaptic spiking\npatterns and \ufb01ring rates than those operating in the regular \ufb01ring mode.\n5.10 Chapter Summary\nIn this chapter, we considered the basic electrical properties of neurons\nincluding their intracellular and membrane resistances, capacitances, andactive voltage-dependent and synaptic conductances.

Over a small enough time period\n/Delta1t, we can approximate\nIe(t)as constant and use the solution 5.47 to step from a time ttot+/Delta1t.\nThis requires replacing the variable t0in equation 5.47 with tand twith\nt+/Delta1tso that\nV(t+/Delta1t)=V\u221e+(V(t)\u2212V\u221e)exp(\u2212/Delta1t/\u03c4V). (5.48)\nThis equation provides an updating rule for the numerical integration of\nequation 5.46. Provided that /Delta1tis suf \ufb01ciently small, repeated application\nof the update rule 5.48 provides an accurate way of determining the mem-brane potential. Furthermore, this method is stable because, if\n/Delta1tis too\nlarge, it will only move Vtoward V\u221eand not, for example, make it grow\nwithout bound.\nThe equation for a general single-compartment conductance-based model,\nequation 5.6 with 5.5, can be written in the same form as equation 5.46 with\nV\u221e=/summationtext\nigiEi+Ie/A/summationtext\nigi(5.49)\nand\n\u03c4V=cm/summationtext\nigi.

We assume that\n/Delta1tis suf \ufb01ciently small so that Vdoes not change ap-\npreciably over this time interval (and similarly [Ca2+] is approximated as\nconstant over this interval if any of the conductances are Ca2+-dependent).\nThen, \u03c4zand z\u221e, which are functions of V(and possibly [Ca2+]) can be\ntreated as constants over this period and zcan be updated by a rule iden-\ntical to 5.48,\nz(t+/Delta1t)=z\u221e+(z(t)\u2212z\u221e)exp(\u2212/Delta1t/\u03c4z). (5.52)\nAn ef \ufb01cient integration scheme for conductance-based models is to alter-\nnate using rule (5.48) to update the membrane potential and rule (5.52)to update all the gating variables. It is important to alternate the updat-ing of Vwith that of the gating variables, rather than doing them all si-\nmultaneously, as this keeps the method accurate to second order in\n/Delta1t.I f\nCa2+-dependent conductances are included, the intracellular Ca2+concen-\ntration should be computed simultaneously with the membrane potential.By alternating the updating, we mean that the membrane potential is com-puted at times 0\n,/Delta1t,2/Delta1t,..., while the gating variables are computed at\ntimes /Delta1t/2,3/Delta1t/2,5/Delta1t/2,....

The \ufb01rst part of\nthis chapter extends the material presented in chapter 5, by examiningsingle-compartment models with a wider variety of voltage-dependentconductances, and hence a wider range of dynamic behaviors, than theHodgkin-Huxley model. In the second part of the chapter, we introducemethods that allow us to study the effects of morphology on the electricalcharacteristics of neurons.

The basic formalism developed byHodgkin and Huxley to describe the Na\n+and K+conductances respon-\nsible for generating action potentials (discussed in chapter 5) is also usedto represent most of the additional conductances encountered in neuronmodeling. Models that treat these aspects of ionic conductances, known asconductance-based models, can reproduce the rich and complex dynam- conductance-based\nmodel ics of real neurons quite accurately. In this chapter, we discuss both single-\nand multi-compartment conductance-based models, beginning with thesingle-compartment case.\nTo review from chapter 5, the membrane potential of a single-compartment\nneuron model, V, is determined by integrating the equation\nc\nmdV\ndt=\u2212 im+Ie\nA. (6.1)\nwith Iethe electrode current, Athe membrane surface area of the cell, and\nimthe membrane current. In the following subsections, we present ex-\npressions for the membrane current in terms of the reversal potentials,maximal conductance parameters, and gating variables of the differentconductances of the models being considered. The gating variables and\nVcomprise the dynamic variables of the model. All the gating variables\nare determined by equations of the form\n\u03c4z(V)dz\ndt=z\u221e(V)\u2212z (6.2)\nwhere we have used the letter zto denote a generic gating variable. The\nfunctions \u03c4z(V)and z\u221e(V)are determined from experimental data. For\nsome conductances, these are written in terms of the open and closingrates\n\u03b1z(V)and\u03b2z(V)(see chapter 5) as\n\u03c4z(V)=1\n\u03b1z(V)+\u03b2z(V)and z\u221e(V)=\u03b1z(V)\n\u03b1z(V)+\u03b2z(V). (6.3)\nWe have written \u03c4z(V)and z\u221e(V)as functions of the membrane potential,\nbut for Ca2+-dependent currents they also depend on the internal Ca2+\nconcentration. We call the \u03b1z(V),\u03b2z(V),\u03c4z(V), and z\u221e(V)collectively\ngating functions. A method for numerically integrating equations 6.1 and6.2 is described in the appendices of chapter 5.\nIn the following subsections, some basic features of conductance-based\nmodels are presented in a sequence of examples of increasing complexity.We do this to illustrate the effects of various conductances and combina-tions of conductances on neuronal activity. Different cells (and even thesame cell held at different resting potentials) can have quite different re-sponse properties due to their particular combinations of conductances.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.2 Conductance-Based Models 3\nResearch on conductance-based models focuses on understanding how\nneuronal response dynamics arises from the properties of membrane andsynaptic conductances, and how the characteristics of different neuronsinteract when they are coupled to each other in networks.\nThe Connor-Stevens Model\nThe Hodgkin-Huxley model of action potential generation, discussed inchapter 5, was developed on the basis of data from the giant axon of thesquid, and we present a multi-compartment simulation of action poten-tial propagation using this model in a later section. The Connor-Stevensmodel (Connor and Stevens, 1971; Connor et al. 1977) provides an alterna-tive description of action potential generation. Like the Hodgkin-Huxleymodel, it contains fast Na\n+, delayed-recti \ufb01er K+, and leakage conduc-\ntances. The fast Na+and delayed-recti \ufb01er K+conductances have some-\nwhat different properties from those of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, inparticular faster kinetics, so the action potentials are briefer. In addition,the Connor-Stevens model contains an extra K\n+conductance, called the\nA-current, that is transient. K+conductances come in wide variety of dif- A-type potassium\ncurrent ferent forms, and the Connor-Stevens model involves two of them.\nThe membrane current in the Connor-Stevens model is\nim=gL(V\u2212EL)+gNam3h(V\u2212ENa)+gKn4(V\u2212EK)+gAa3b(V\u2212EA)\n(6.4)\nwhere gL=0.003 mS/mm2and EL= -17 mV are the maximal conductance\nand reversal potential for the leak conductance, and gNa=1.2m S / m m2,\ngK=0.2m S / m m2,gA=0.477 mS/mm2,ENa=5 5m V , EK= -72 mV , and\nEA= -75 mV (although the A-current is carried by K+, the model does not\nrequire EA=EK) and are similar parameters for the active conductances.\nThe gating variables, m,h,n,a, and b, are determined by equations of the\nform 6.2 with the gating functions given in appendix A.\nThe fast Na+and delayed-recti \ufb01er K+conductances generate action po-\ntentials in the Connor-Stevens model just as they do in the Hodgkin-Huxley model (see chapter 5). What is the role of the additional A-current?Figure 6.1 illustrates action potential generation in the Connor-Stevensmodel. In the absence of an injected electrode current or synaptic input,the membrane potential of the model remains constant at a resting value of\n\u221268 mV. For a constant electrode current greater than a threshold value,\nthe model neuron generates action potentials. Figure 6.1A shows howthe\ufb01ring rate of the model depends on the magnitude of the electrode\ncurrent relative to the threshold value. The \ufb01ring rate rises continuously\nfrom zero and then increases roughly linearly for currents over the rangeshown. Figure 6.1B shows an example of action potential generation forone particular value of the electrode current.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\n60\n40\n20\n0firing rate ( Hz)\n1.51.41.31.21.11.00.9\nI /Ithreshold\n200\n150\n100\n50\n0firing rate ( Hz)\n1.31.21.11.00.9\nI /IthresholdA B\nC D-80-40040V (mV)\n100806040200\nt  (ms)\n-80-400V  (mV)\n200150100500\nt  (ms)\nFigure 6.1: Firing of action potentials in the Connor-Stevens model.

B) An example of action po-tentials generated by constant current injection. C) Firing rate as a function ofelectrode current when the A-current is turned off. The \ufb01ring rate now rises dis-\ncontinuously from zero as the current increases beyond the threshold value. D)Delayed \ufb01ring due to hyperpolarization. The neuron was held hyperpolarized for\na prolonged period by injection of negative current. At t\n=50 ms, the negative\nelectrode current was switched to a positive value. The A-current delays the oc-currence of the \ufb01rst action potential.\nFigure 6.1C shows the \ufb01ring rate as a function of electrode current for the\nConnor-Stevens model with the maximal conductance of the A-current setto zero. The leakage conductance and reversal potential have been ad-justed to keep the resting potential and membrane resistance the same asin the original model. The \ufb01ring rate is clearly much higher with the A-\ncurrent turned off. This is because the deinactivation rate of the A-currentlimits the rise time of the membrane potential between action potentials.In addition, the transition from no \ufb01ring for currents less than the thresh-\nold value to \ufb01ring with suprathreshold currents is different when the A-\ncurrent is eliminated. Without the A-current, the \ufb01ring rate jumps dis-\ncontinuously to a nonzero value rather than rising continuously. Neuronswith\ufb01ring rates that rise continuously from zero as a function of electrode\ncurrent are called type I, and those with discontinuous jumps in their \ufb01r-\ning rates at threshold are called type II. An A-current is not the only mech- type I, type II\nanism that can produce a type I response but, as \ufb01gures 6.1A and 6.1C\nshow, it plays this role in the Connor-Stevens model. The Hodgkin-Huxleymodel produces a type II response.\nAnother effect of the A-current is illustrated in \ufb01gure 6.1D. Here the model\nneuron was held hyperpolarized by negative current injection for an ex-\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

While the neuron was hyperpolarized, the A-current deinactivated,that is, the variable bincreased toward one. When the electrode current\nswitched sign and the neuron depolarized, the A-current \ufb01rst activated\nand then inactivated. This delayed the \ufb01rst spike following the change in\nthe electrode current.\nPostinhibitory Rebound and Bursting\nThe range of responses exhibited by the Connor-Stevens model neuron canbe extended by including a transient Ca\n2+conductance. The conductance transient Ca2+\nconductance we use was modeled by Huguenard and McCormick (1992) on the basis of\ndata from thalamic relay cells. The membrane current due to the transientCa\n2+conductance is expressed as\niCaT=gCaTM2H(V\u2212ECa) (6.5)\nwith, for the example given here, gCaT=13\u00b5S/mm2and ECa=120 mV.\nThe gating variables for the transient Ca2+conductance are determined\nfrom the gating functions in appendix A.\nSeveral different Ca2+conductances are commonly expressed in neuronal\nmembranes. These are categorized as L, T, N, and P types. L-type Ca2+L, T, N and P type\nCa2+channels currents are persistent as far as their voltage dependence is concerned, and\nthey activate at a relatively high threshold. They inactivate due to a Ca2+-\ndependent rather than voltage-dependent process. T-type Ca2+currents\nhave lower activation thresholds and are transient. N- and P-type Ca2+\nconductances have intermediate thresholds and are respectively transientand persistent. They may be responsible for the Ca\n2+entry that causes the\nrelease of transmitter at presynaptic terminals. Entry of Ca2+into a neuron\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nhas many secondary consequences ranging from gating Ca2+-dependent\nchannels to inducing long-term modi \ufb01cations of synaptic conductances.\nA transient Ca2+conductance acts, in many ways, like a slower version of\nthe transient Na+conductance that generates action potentials. Instead of\nproducing an action potential, a transient Ca2+conductance generates a\nslower transient depolarization sometimes called a Ca2+spike. This tran- Ca2+spike\nsient depolarization causes the neuron to \ufb01re a burst of action potentials,burst\nwhich are Na+spikes riding on the slower Ca2+spike. Figure 6.2 shows\nsuch a burst and illustrates one way to produce it. In this example, themodel neuron was hyperpolarized for an extended period and then re-leased from hyperpolarization by setting the electrode current to zero.During the prolonged hyperpolarization, the transient Ca\n2+conductance\ndeinactivated. When the electrode current was set to zero, the resultingdepolarization activated the transient Ca\n2+conductance and generated a\nburst of action potentials. The burst in \ufb01gure 6.2 is delayed due to the pres-\nence of the A-current in the original Connor-Stevens model, and it termi-nates when the Ca\n2+conductance inactivates. Generation of action poten-\ntials in response to release from hyperpolarization is called postinhibitoryrebound because, in a natural setting, the hyperpolarization would be postinhibitory\nrebound caused by inhibitory synaptic input, not by current injection.\nThe transient Ca\n2+current is an important component of models of thala-\nmic relay neurons. These neurons exhibit different \ufb01ring patterns in sleep thalamic relay\nneuron and wakeful states. Action potentials tend to appear in bursts during\nsleep. Figure 6.3 shows an example of three states of activity of a modelthalamic relay cell due to Wang (1994) that has, in addition to fast Na\n+,\ndelayed-recti \ufb01er K+, and transient Ca2+conductances, a hyperpolariza-\ntion activated mixed-cation conductance, and a persistent Na+conduc-\ntance. The cell is silent or \ufb01res action potentials in a regular pattern or in\nbursts depending on the level of current injection. In particular, injectionof small amounts of negative current leads to bursting. This occurs be-cause the hyperpolarization due to the current injection deinactivates thetransient Ca\n2+current and activates the hyperpolarization activated cur-\nrent. The regular \ufb01ring mode of the middle plot of \ufb01gure 6.3 is believed to\nbe relevant during wakeful states when the thalamus is faithfully report-ing input from the sensory periphery to the cortex.\nNeurons can \ufb01re action potentials either at a steady rate or in bursts even\nin the absence of current injection or synaptic input. Periodic bursting is acommon feature of neurons in central patterns generators, which are neu-ral circuits that produce periodic patterns of activity to drive rhythmic mo-tor behaviors such as walking, running, or chewing. To illustrate periodicbursting, we consider a model constructed to match the activity of neu-rons in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion (STG), a neuronal circuit stomatogastric\nganglion that controls chewing and digestive rhythms in the foregut of lobsters and\ncrabs. The model contains fast Na\n+, delayed-recti \ufb01er K+, A-type K+, and\ntransient Ca2+conductances similar to those discussed above, although\nthe formulae and parameters used are somewhat different.

Due to the complexity\nof the model, we do not provide complete descriptions of its conductancesexcept for the Ca\n2+-dependent K+conductance which plays a particularly\nsigni\ufb01cant role in the model.\nThe repolarization of the membrane potential after an action potential is\noften carried out both by the delayed-recti \ufb01er K+conductance and by a\nfast Ca2+-dependent K+conductance.

This factor is 1 /(zF)where zis the number of charges on the\nion ( z=2f o rC a2+), and Fis the Faraday constant. If, as is normally the\ncase, [Ca2+] is in mols/liter, \u03b3should also contain a factor that converts the\nvolume measure to liters, 106mm3/liter. Finally, \u03b3must be multiplied by\nthe additional factor that re \ufb02ects fast intracellular Ca2+buffering. Most of\nthe Ca2+ions that enter a neuron are rapidly bound to intracellular buffers,\nso only a fraction of the Ca2+current through membrane channels is actu-\nally available to change the concentration [Ca2+]o ff r e eC a2+ions in the\ncell. This factor is about 1%. The minus sign in front of the \u03b3factor in\nequation 6.7 is due to the de \ufb01nition of membrane currents as positive in\nthe outward direction.\nFigure 6.4 shows the model STG neuron \ufb01ring action potentials in bursts.\nAs in the models of \ufb01gures 6.2 and 6.3, the bursts are transient Ca2+spikes\nwith action potentials riding on top of them. The Ca2+current during\nthese bursts causes a dramatic increase in the intracellular Ca2+concen-\ntration. This activates the Ca2+-dependent K+current which, along with\nthe inactivation of the Ca2+current, terminates the burst. The interburst\ninterval is determined primarily by the time it takes for the intracellularCa\n2+concentration to return to a low value, which deactivates the Ca2+-\ndependent K+current, allowing another burst to be generated. Although\n\ufb01gure 6.4 shows that the conductance of the Ca2+-dependent K+current\nreaches a low value immediately after each burst (due to its voltage de-pendence), this initial dip is too early for another burst to be generated atthat point in the cycle.\nThe STG is a model system for investigating the effects of neuromodula-\ntors, such as amines and neuropeptides, on the activity patterns of a neu-ral network. Neuromodulators modify neuronal and network behavior byactivating, deactivating, or otherwise altering the properties of membraneand synaptic channels. Neuromodulation has a major impact on virtuallyall neural networks ranging from peripheral motor pattern generators likethe STG to the sensory, motor, and cognitive circuits of the brain.\n6.3 The Cable Equation\nSingle-compartment models describe the membrane potential over an en-tire neuron with a single variable. Membrane potentials can vary consid-erably over the surface of the cell membrane, especially for neurons withlong and narrow processes or if we consider rapidly changing membranepotentials.

(A adapted from Stuart and Sakmann, 1994; B adapted fromStuart and Spruston, 1998.)\nThe attenuation and delay within a neuron are most severe when electri-\ncal signals travel down the long and narrow, cable-like structures of den-dritic or axonal branches. For this reason, the mathematical analysis ofsignal propagation within neurons is called cable theory. Dendritic and cable theory\naxonal cables are typically narrow enough that variations of the potentialin the radial or axial directions are negligible compared to longitudinalvariations. Therefore, the membrane potential along a neuronal cable isexpressed as a function of a single longitudinal spatial coordinate xand\ntime, V\n(x,t), and the basic problem is to solve for this potential.\nCurrent \ufb02ows within a neuron due to voltage gradients. In chapter 5, we\ndiscussed how the potential difference across a segment of neuronal cableis related to the longitudinal current \ufb02owing down the cable. The longi-\ntudinal resistance of a cable segment of length\n/Delta1xand radius ais given\nby multiplying the intracellular resistivity rLby/Delta1xand dividing by the\ncross-sectional area, \u03c0a2, so that RL=rL/Delta1x/(\u03c0a2). The voltage drop across\nthis length of cable, /Delta1V, is then related to the amount of longitudinal cur-\nrent\ufb02ow by Ohm\u2019s law. In chapter 5, we discussed the magnitude of this\ncurrent \ufb02ow, but for the present purposes, we also need to de \ufb01ne a sign\nconvention for its direction. We de \ufb01ne currents \ufb02owing in the direction\nof increasing xas positive. By this convention, the relationship between\n/Delta1Vand ILgiven by Ohm\u2019s law is /Delta1V=\u2212 RLILor/Delta1V=\u2212 rL/Delta1xIL/(\u03c0a2).\nSolving this for the longitudinal current, we \ufb01ndIL=\u2212\u03c0a2/Delta1V/(rL/Delta1x).I t\nis useful to take the limit of this expression for in \ufb01nitesimally short cable\nsegments, that is as /Delta1x\u21920. In this limit, the ratio of /Delta1Vto/Delta1xbecomes\nthe derivative \u2202V/\u2202x. We use a partial derivative here, because Vcan also\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

To derive the cable equation, we consider the cur-rents within the small segment shown in \ufb01gure 6.6. This segment has a\nradius aand a short length\n/Delta1x. The rate of change of the membrane po-\ntential due to currents \ufb02owing into and out of this region is determined\nby its capacitance. Recall from chapter 5 that the capacitance of a mem-brane is determined by multiplying the speci \ufb01c membrane capacitance c\nm\nby the area of the membrane. The cylinder of membrane shown in \ufb01g-\nure 6.6 has a surface area of 2 \u03c0a/Delta1xand hence a capacitance of 2 \u03c0a/Delta1xcm.\nThe amount of current needed to change the membrane potential at a rate\n\u2202V/\u2202tis 2\u03c0a/Delta1xcm\u2202V/\u2202t.\n/A0\n/AP/CP\n/BE/D6/C4\n/BS/CE/BS/DC\n/AC/AC/AC/AC/D0/CT/CU/D8\n/A0\n/AP/CP\n/BE/D6/C4\n/BS/CE/BS/DC\n/AC/AC/AC/AC/D6/CX/CV/CW /D8\n/BE /CP/A1 /DC\n/BE /AP/CP /A1 /DC/CR/D1\n/BS /CE /BP/BS /D8\n/BE /AP/CP /A1 /DC/CX/CT\n/BE /AP/CP /A1 /DC/CX/D1\nFigure 6.6: The segment of neuron used in the derivation of the cable equation.\nThe longitudinal, membrane, and electrode currents that determine the rate ofchange of the membrane potential within this segment are denoted.

The expression involving the speci \ufb01c membrane ca-\npacitance refers to the rate at which charge builds up on the cell membrane gener-ating changes in the membrane potential.\nAll of the currents that can change the membrane potential of the segment\nbeing considered are shown in \ufb01gure 6.6. Current can \ufb02ow longitudinally\ninto the segment from neighboring segments, and expression 6.8 has beenused in \ufb01gure 6.6 to specify the longitudinal currents at both ends of the\nsegment. Current can \ufb02ow across the membrane of the segment we are\nconsidering through ion and synaptic receptor channels, or through anelectrode. The contribution from ion and synaptic channels is expressedas a current per unit area of membrane i\nmtimes the surface area of the\nsegment, 2 \u03c0a/Delta1x. The electrode current is not normally expressed as a\ncurrent per unit area, but, for the present purposes, it is convenient to\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nde\ufb01neieto be the total electrode current \ufb02owing into a given region of\nthe neuronal cable divided by the surface area of that region. The totalamount of electrode current being injected into the cable segment of \ufb01gure\n6.6 is then i\ne2\u03c0a/Delta1x. Because the electrode current is normally speci \ufb01ed by\nIe, not by a current per unit area, all the results we obtain will ultimately be\nre-expressed in terms of Ie. Following the standard convention, membrane\nand synaptic currents are de \ufb01ned as positive when they are outward, and\nelectrode currents are de \ufb01ned as positive when they are inward.\nThe cable equation is derived by setting the sum of all the currents shown\nin\ufb01gure 6.6 equal to the current needed to charge the membrane. The\ntotal longitudinal current entering the cylinder is the difference betweenthe current \ufb02owing in on the left and that \ufb02owing out on the right.

(6.11)\nTo determine the membrane potential, equation (6.11) must be aug-\nmented by appropriate boundary conditions. The boundary conditions boundary\nconditions on thecable equationspecify what happens to the membrane potential when the neuronal ca-\nble branches or terminates. The point at which a cable branches or equiv-alently where multiple cable segments join is called a node. At such abranching node, the potential must be continuous, that is, the functions\nV\n(x,t)de\ufb01ned along each of the segments must yield the same result\nwhen evaluated at the xvalue corresponding to the node. In addition,\ncharge must be conserved, which means that the sum of the longitudi-nal currents entering (or leaving) a node along all of its branches must bezero. According to equation 6.8, the longitudinal current entering a nodeis proportional to the square of the cable radius times the derivative ofthe potential evaluated at that point, a\n2\u2202V/\u2202x. The sum of the longitudi-\nnal currents entering the node, computed by evaluating these derivativesalong each cable segment at the point where they meet at the node, mustbe zero.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.3 The Cable Equation 13\nSeveral different boundary conditions can be imposed at the end of a ter-\nminating cable segment. A reasonable condition is that no current should\ufb02ow out of the end of the cable. By equation 6.8, this means that the spatial\nderivative of the potential must vanish at a termination point.\nDue to the complexities of neuronal membrane currents and morpholo-\ngies, the cable equation is most often solved numerically using multi-compartmental techniques described later in this chapter. However, it isuseful to study analytic solutions of the cable equation in simple cases toget a feel for how different morphological features such as long dendriticcables, branching nodes, changes in cable radii, and cable ends affect themembrane potential.\nLinear Cable Theory\nBefore we can solve the cable equation by any method, the membrane cur-rent i\nmmust be speci \ufb01ed. We discussed models of various ion channel con-\ntributions to the membrane current in chapter 5 and earlier in this chapter.These models typically produce nonlinear expressions that are too com-plex to allow analytic solution of the cable equation. The analytic solu-tions we discuss use two rather drastic approximations; synaptic currentsare ignored, and the membrane current is written as a linear function of themembrane potential. Eliminating synaptic currents requires us to examinehow a neuron responds to the electrode current i\ne. In some cases, electrode\ncurrent can mimic the effects of a synaptic conductance, although the twoare not equivalent. Nevertheless, studying responses to electrode currentallows us to investigate the effects of different morphologies on membranepotentials.\nTypically, a linear approximation for the membrane current is only valid\nif the membrane potential stays within a limited range, for example closeto the resting potential of the cell. The resting potential is de \ufb01ned as the\npotential where no net current \ufb02ows across the membrane. Near this po-\ntential, we approximate the membrane current per unit area as\ni\nm=(V\u2212Vrest)/rm (6.12)\nwhere Vrestis the resting potential, and the factor of rmfollows from the\nde\ufb01nition of the membrane resistance. It is convenient to de \ufb01nevas the\nmembrane potential relative to the resting potential, v=V\u2212Vrest, so that\nim=v/rm.\nIf the radii of the cable segments used to model a neuron are constant ex-\ncept at branches and abrupt junctions, the factor a2in equation 6.11 can be\ntaken out of the derivative and combined with the prefactor 1 /2arLto pro-\nduce a factor a/2rLthat multiplies the second spatial derivative. With this\nmodi \ufb01cation and use of the linear expression for the membrane current,\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nthe cable equation for vis\ncm\u2202v\n\u2202t=a\n2rL\u22022v\n\u2202x2\u2212v\nrm+ie. (6.13)\nIt is convenient to multiply this equation by rm, turning the factor that\nmultiplies the time derivative on the left side into the membrane time con-stant\n\u03c4m=rmcm. This also changes the expression multiplying the spatial\nsecond derivative on the right side of equation 6.13 to arm/2rL. This factor\nhas the dimensions of length squared, and it de \ufb01nes a fundamental length\nconstant for a segment of cable of radius a, the electrotonic length, \u03bbelectrotonic\nlength\n\u03bb=/radicalbiggarm\n2rL. (6.14)\nUsing the values rm=1M/Omega1\u00b7mm2and rL=1k/Omega1\u00b7mm, a cable of radius a=\n2\u00b5m has an electrotonic length of 1 mm. A segment of cable with radius\naand length \u03bbhas a membrane resitance that is equal to its longitudinal\nresistance, as can be seen from equation 6.14, R\u03bb\nR\u03bb=rm\n2\u03c0a\u03bb=rL\u03bb\n\u03c0a2. (6.15)\nThe resistance R\u03bbde\ufb01ned by this equation is a useful quantity that enters\ninto a number of calculations.\nExpressed in terms of \u03c4mand\u03bb, the cable equation becomes\n\u03c4m\u2202v\n\u2202t=\u03bb2\u22022v\n\u2202x2\u2212v+rmie. (6.16)\nEquation 6.16 is a linear equation for vsimilar to the diffusion equation,\nand it can be solved by standard methods of mathematical analysis. Theconstants\n\u03c4mand\u03bbset the scale for temporal and spatial variations in the\nmembrane potential. For example, the membrane potential requires a timeof order\n\u03c4mto settle down after a transient, and deviations in the mem-\nbrane potential due to localized electrode currents decay back to zero overa length of order\n\u03bb.\nThe membrane potential is affected both by the form of the cable equation\nand by the boundary conditions imposed at branching nodes and termi-nations. To isolate these two effects, we consider two idealized cases: anin\ufb01nite cable that does not branch or terminate, and a single branching\nnode that joins three semi-in \ufb01nite cables. Of course, real neuronal cables\nare not in \ufb01nitely long, but the solutions we \ufb01nd are applicable for long\ncables far from their ends. We determine the potential for both of thesemorphologies when current is injected at a single point. Because the equa-tion we are studying is linear, the membrane potential for any other spatialdistribution of electrode current can be determined by summing solutionscorresponding to current injection at different points. The use of pointinjection to build more general solutions is a standard method of linearanalysis. In this context, the solution for a point source of current injectionis called a Green\u2019s function. Green\u2019s function\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.3 The Cable Equation 15\nAn In \ufb01nite Cable\nIn general, solutions to the linear cable equation are functions of both po-\nsition and time. However, if the current being injected is held constant, themembrane potential settles to a steady-state solution that is independentof time. Solving for this time-independent solution is easier than solvingthe full time-dependent equation, because the cable equation reduces toan ordinary differential equation in the static case,\n\u03bb2d2v\ndx2=v\u2212rmie. (6.17)\nFor the localized current injection we wish to study, ieis zero everywhere\nexcept within a small region of size /Delta1xaround the injection site, which we\ntake to be x=0. Eventually we will let /Delta1x\u21920. Away from the injection\nsite, the linear cable equation is \u03bb2d2v/dx2=v, which has the general so-\nlution v(x)=B1exp(\u2212x/\u03bb)+B2exp(x/\u03bb)with as yet undetermined coef-\n\ufb01cients B1and B2. These constant coef \ufb01cients are determined by imposing\nboundary conditions appropriate to the particular morphology being con-sidered. For an in \ufb01nite cable, on physical grounds, we simply require that\nthe solution does not grow without bound when x\n\u2192\u00b1 \u221e . This means\nthat we must choose the solution with B1=0 for the region x<0a n dt h e\nsolution with B2=0f o r x>0. Because the solution must be continuous at\nx=0, we must require B1=B2=B, and these two solutions can be com-\nbined into a single expression v(x)=Bexp(\u2212|x|/\u03bb). The remaining task\nis to determine B, which we do by balancing the current injected with the\ncurrent that diffuses away from x=0.\nIn the small region of size /Delta1xaround x=0 where the current is injected,\nthe full equation \u03bb2d2v/dx2=v\u2212rmiemust be solved. If the total amount\nof current injected by the electrode is Ie, the current per unit area injected\ninto this region is Ie/2\u03c0a/Delta1x. This grows without bound as /Delta1x\u21920. The\n\ufb01rst derivative of the membrane potential v(x)=Bexp(\u2212|x|/\u03bb)is discon-\ntinuous at the point x=0. For small /Delta1x, the derivative at one side of the\nregion we are discussing (at x=\u2212/Delta1x/2) is approximately B/\u03bb, while at\nthe other side (at x=+/Delta1x/2) it is \u2212B/\u03bb. In these expressions, we have\nused the fact that /Delta1xis small to set exp (\u2212|/Delta1x|/2\u03bb)\u22481. For small /Delta1x,t h e\nsecond derivative is approximately the difference between these two \ufb01rst\nderivatives divided by /Delta1x, which is \u22122B/\u03bb/Delta1 x. We can ignore the term vin\nthe cable equation within this small region, because it is not proportionalto 1\n//Delta1x. Substituting the expressions we have derived for the remaining\nterms in the equation, we \ufb01nd that \u22122\u03bb2B/\u03bb/Delta1 x=\u2212 rmIe/2\u03c0a/Delta1x, which\nmeans that B=IeR\u03bb/2, using R\u03bbfrom equation 6.15. Thus, the membrane\npotential for static current injection at the point x=0 along an in \ufb01nite\ncable is\nv(x)=IeR\u03bb\n2exp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212|x|\n\u03bb/parenrightbigg\n. (6.18)\nAccording to this result, the membrane potential away from the site of\ncurrent injection ( x=0) decays exponentially with length constant \u03bb(see\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-4 -2 0 2 4\nx /\u03bb1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-4 -2 0 2 4A B\nIe\nv(x,t)/IeR\u03bb\nx /\u03bb2v(x)/IeR\u03bb\nIet = 2t = 1t = 0.1\nFigure 6.7: The potential for current injection at the point x=0 along an in \ufb01nite\ncable.

The ratio of the membrane potential at the injection site to\nthe magnitude of the injected current is called the input resistance of thecable. The value of the potential at x\n=0i s IeR\u03bb/2 indicating that the\nin\ufb01nite cable has an input resistance of R\u03bb/2. Each direction of the cable\nacts like a resistance of R\u03bband these two act in parallel to produce a total\nresistance half as big. Note that each semi-in \ufb01nite cable extending from\nthe point x=0 has a resistance equal to a \ufb01nite cable of length \u03bb.\nWe now consider the membrane potential produced by an instantaneous\npulse of current injected at the point x=0a tt h et i m e t=0. Speci \ufb01cally,\nwe consider ie=Ie\u03b4(x)\u03b4(t)/2\u03c0a.

(6.19)\nIn this case, the spatial dependence of the potential is determined by a\nGaussian, rather than an exponential function. The Gaussian is alwayscentered around the injection site, so the potential is always largest at\nx\n=0. The width of the Gaussian curve around x=0 is proportional to\n\u03bb\u221at/\u03c4m. As expected, \u03bbsets the scale for this spatial variation, but the\nwidth also grows as the square root of the time measured in units of \u03c4m.\nThe factor (4\u03c0\u03bb2t/\u03c4m)\u22121/2in equation 6.19 preserves the total area under\nthis Gaussian curve, but the additional exponential factor exp (\u2212t/\u03c4m)re-\nduces the integrated amplitude over time. As a result, the spatial depen-dence of the membrane potential is described by a spreading Gaussianfunction with an integral that decays exponentially ( \ufb01gure 6.7B).\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Nevertheless, we can de \ufb01ne a type of \u2018velocity\u2019 for this solution by\ncomputing the time tmaxwhen the maximum of the potential occurs at a\ngiven spatial location.

For simplicity, we discuss the solution for static current injectionat a point, but the results generalize directly to the case of time-dependentcurrents. We label the potentials along the three segments by\nv1,v2, and\nv3, and label the distance outward from the junction point along any given\nsegment by the coordinate x.

The only term that has a discontinuous \ufb01rst derivative within the\nrange being considered is the \ufb01rst term in the expression for\nv2, and this\nsolves the cable equation at the current injection site because it is identicalto 6.18.

In both cases, the site of current injection is oneelectrotonic length constant away from the junction. The two daughterbranches have little effect on the fall-off of the potential away from theelectrode site in \ufb01gure 6.9A. This is because the thin branches do not rep-\nresent a large current sink. The thick branch has a bigger effect on theattenuation of the potential along the thin branch receiving the electrodecurrent in \ufb01gure 6.9B. This can be seen as an asymmetry in the fall-off of\nthe potential on either side of the electrode. Loading by the thick cablesegment contributes to a quite severe attenuation between the two thinbranches in \ufb01gure 6.9B. Comparison of \ufb01gures 6.9A and B reveals a gen-\neral feature of static attenuation in a passive cable. Attenuation near thesoma due to potentials arising in the periphery is typically greater thanattenuation in the periphery due to potentials arising near the soma.\nThe Rall Model\nThe in \ufb01nite and semi-in \ufb01nite cables we have considered are clearly math-\nematical idealizations. We now turn to a model neuron introduced by Rall(1959, 1977) that, while still highly simpli \ufb01ed, captures some of the im-\nportant elements that affect the responses of real neurons.

In Rall\u2019s model, a com-\npact soma region (represented by one compartment) is connected to a sin-gle equivalent cylindrical cable that replaces the entire dendritic region ofthe neuron (see the schematics in \ufb01gures 6.10 and 6.12). The critical feature\nof the model is the choice of the radius and length for the equivalent cableto best match the properties of the dendritic structure being approximated.\nThe radius aand length Lof the equivalent cable are determined by match-\ning two important elements of the full dendritic tree. These are its averagelength in electrotonic units, which determines the amount of attenuation,and the total surface area, which determines the total membrane resistanceand capacitance. The average electrotonic length of a dendrite is deter-mined by considering direct paths from the soma to the terminals of thedendrite. The electrotonic lengths for these paths are constructed by mea-suring the distance traveled along each of the cable segments traversedin units of the electrotonic length constant for that segment. In general,the total electrotonic length measured by summing these electrotonic seg-ment lengths depends on which terminal of the tree is used as the endpoint. However, an average value can be used to de \ufb01ne an electrotonic\nlength for the full dendritic structure. The length Lof the equivalent ca-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nble is then chosen so that L/\u03bbis equal to this average electrotonic length,\nwhere \u03bbis the length constant for the equivalent cable. The radius of the\nequivalent cable, which is needed to compute \u03bb, is determined by setting\nthe surface area of the equivalent cable, 2 \u03c0aL, equal to the surface area of\nthe full dendritic tree.\nUnder some restrictive circumstances the equivalent cable reproduces the\neffects of a full tree exactly. Among these conditions is the requirement\na3/2\n1=a3/2\n2+a3/2\n3on the radii of any three segments being joined at a nodes\nwithin the tree. Note from equation 6.22 that this conditions makes p1=\np2+p3=1/2. However, even when the so-called 3/2 law is not exact,\nthe equivalent cable is an extremely useful and often reasonably accuratesimpli \ufb01cation.\nFigures 6.10 and 6.12 depict static solutions of the Rall model for two dif-\nferent recording con \ufb01gurations expressed in the form of equivalent cir-\ncuits. The equivalent circuits are an intuitive way of describing the so-lution of the cable equation. In \ufb01gure 6.10, constant current is injected\ninto the soma. The circuit diagram shows an arrangement of resistorsthat replicates the results of solving the time-independent cable equation(equation 6.17) for the purposes of voltage measurements at the soma,\nvsoma, and at a distance xalong the equivalent cable, v(x). The values\nfor these resistances (and similarly the values of R3and R4given below)\nare set so that the equivalent circuit reconstructs the solution of the ca-ble equation obtained using standard methods (see for example Tuckwell,1988).

Equality of the voltage attenuation\nmeasured in one direction and the current attenuation measured in theopposite direction is a general feature of linear cable theory.\nThe Morphoelectrotonic Transform\nThe membrane potential for a neuron of complex morphology is obviouslymuch more dif \ufb01cult to compute than the simple cases we have considered.\nFortunately, ef \ufb01cient numerical schemes (discussed later in this chapter)\nexist for generating solutions for complex cable structures. However, evenwhen the solution is known, it is still dif \ufb01cult to visualize the effects of\na complex morphology on the potential. Zador, Agmon-Snir, and Segev(1995; see also Tsai et al., 1994) devised a scheme for depicting the attenua-tion and delay of the membrane potential for complex morphologies. Thevoltage attenuation, as plotted in \ufb01gure 6.11, is not an appropriate quan-\ntity to represent geometrically because it is not additive. Consider threepoints along a cable satisfying x\n1>x2>x3. The attenuation between x1\nand x3is the product of the attenuation from x1tox2and from x2tox3,\nv(x1)/v(x3)=(v(x1)/v(x2))(v( x2)/v(x3)). An additive quantity can be\nobtained by taking the logarithm of the attenuation, due to the identityln\n(v(x1)/v(x3))=ln(v(x1)/v(x2))+ln(v(x2)/v(x3)).

The arrows in the diagrams indicate that the reference potential inthese cases is the somatic potential. (Adapted from Zador et al, 1995.)\nAnother morphoelectrotonic transform can be used to indicate the amount\nof delay in the voltage waveform produced by a transient input current.The morphoelectrotonic transform uses a different de \ufb01nition of delay than\nthat used in Figure 6.8B. The delay between any two points is de \ufb01ned as\nthe difference between the centroid, or center of \u2018gravity\u2019, of the voltageresponse at these points.

Note how much smaller this diagram is than the one in the centralpanel of \ufb01gure 6.13. This illustrates the general feature mentioned previ-\nously that potentials are attenuated much less in the outward than in theinward direction. This is because the thin dendrites provide less of a cur-rent sink for potentials arising from the soma than the soma provides forpotentials coming from the dendrites.\n100 Hz 500 Hz\n0 Hz/BD /BP/CT\nFigure 6.14: Morphoelectrotonic transforms of the same neuron as in \ufb01gure 6.13\nbut showing the outward log-attenuation for DC and oscillating input currents.Distances in these diagrams are proportional to the logarithm of the amplitude ofthe voltage oscillations at a given point divided by the amplitude of the oscillationsat the soma when a sinusoidal current is injected into the soma.

The scale bar denotes the distance corresponding to an attenuation ofexp\n(\u22121). (Adapted from Zador et al, 1995.)\nThe capacitance of neuronal cables causes the voltage attenuation for time-\ndependent current injection to increase as a function of frequency. Figure6.14 compares the attenuation of dendritic potentials relative to the so-matic potential when DC or sinusoidal current of two different frequen-cies is injected into the soma. Clearly, attenuation increases dramaticallyas a function of frequency. Thus, a neuron that appears electrotonicallycompact for static or low frequency current injection may be not compactwhen higher frequencies are considered. For example, action potential\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.4 Multi-Compartment Models 25\nwaveforms, that correspond to frequencies around 500 Hz, are much more\nseverely attenuated within neurons than slower varying potentials.\n6.4 Multi-Compartment Models\nThe cable equation can only be solved analytically in relatively simplecases. When the complexities of real membrane conductances are in-cluded, the membrane potential must be computed numerically. This isdone by splitting the neuron being modeled into separate regions or com-partments and approximating the continuous membrane potential V\n(x,t)\nby a discrete set of values representing the potentials within the differ-\nent compartments. This assumes that each compartment is small enoughso that there is negligible variation of the membrane potential across it.The precision of such a multi-compartmental description depends on thenumber of compartments used and on their size relative to the length con-stants that characterize their electrotonic compactness. Figure 6.15 showsa schematic diagram of a cortical pyramidal neuron, along with a seriesof compartmental approximations of its structure. The number of com-partments used can range from thousands, in some models, to one, for thedescription at the extreme right of \ufb01gure 6.15.\nFigure 6.15: A sequence of approximations of the structure of a neuron.\nThe neuron is represented by a variable number of discrete compartmentseach representing a region that is described by a single membrane poten-tial. The connectors between compartments represent resistive couplings.The simplest description is the single-compartment model furthest to theright. (Neuron diagram from Haberly, 1990.)\nIn a multi-compartment model, each compartment has its own membrane\npotential V\n\u00b5(where \u00b5labels compartments), and its own gating variables\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nthat determine the membrane current for compartment \u00b5,i\u00b5\nm. Each mem-\nbrane potential V\u00b5satis\ufb01es an equation similar to 6.1 except that the com-\npartments couple to their neighbors in the multi-compartment structure(\ufb01gure 6.16). For a non-branching cable, each compartment is coupled to\ntwo neighbors, and the equations for the membrane potentials of the com-partments are\nc\nmdV\u00b5\ndt=\u2212 i\u00b5\nm+I\u00b5\ne\nA\u00b5+g\u00b5,\u00b5+1(V\u00b5+1\u2212V\u00b5)+g\u00b5,\u00b5\u22121(V\u00b5\u22121\u2212V\u00b5).(6.29)\nHere I\u00b5\neis the total electrode current \ufb02owing into compartment \u00b5, and\nA\u00b5is its surface area. Compartments at the ends of a cable have only\none neighbor and thus only a single term replacing the last two terms inequation 6.29. For a compartment where a cable branches in two, there arethree such terms corresponding to coupling of the branching node to the\ufb01rst compartment in each of the daughter branches.\nEsEKENaECaELvvv sV1\ng0,1EKENaECaELvvvV2\ng4,2\nEKENaECaELvvvV3\ng5,3g2,112\n3\ng1,2\ng1,3\ng3,1g1,0g2,4\ng3,5\nFigure 6.16: A multi-compartment model of a neuron. The expanded region\nshows three compartments at a branch point where a single cable splits into two.Each compartment has membrane and synaptic conductances, as indicated by theequivalent electrical circuit, and the compartments are coupled together by resis-tors.

Using the results of\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.4 Multi-Compartment Models 27\nchapter 5, the resistance between two such compartments, measured from\ntheir centers, is the intracellular resistivity, rLtimes the distance between\nthe compartment centers divided by the cross-sectional area, rLL/\u03c0a2.T h e\ntotal current \ufb02owing from compartment \u00b5+1 to compartment \u00b5is then\n\u03c0a2(V\u00b5+1\u2212V\u00b5)/rLL. Equation 6.29 for the potential within a compart-\nment\u00b5refers to currents per unit area of membrane. Thus, we must divide\nthe total current from compartment \u00b5/primeby the surface area of compartment\n\u00b5,2\u03c0aL. Thus, we \ufb01nd that g\u00b5,\u00b5/prime=a/(2rLL2).\nThe value of g\u00b5,\u00b5/primeis given by a more complex expression if the two neigh-\nboring compartments have different lengths or radii. This can occur whena tapering cable is approximated by a sequence of cylindrical compart-ments, or at a branch point where a single compartment connects withtwo other compartments as in \ufb01gure 6.16. In either case, suppose that com-\npartment\n\u00b5has length L\u00b5and radius a\u00b5and compartment \u00b5/primehas length\nL\u00b5/primeand radius a\u00b5/prime.

(6.30)\nEquations 6.29 for all of the compartments of a model determine the mem-\nbrane potential throughout the neuron with a spatial resolution givenby the compartment size. An ef \ufb01cient method for integrating the cou-\npled multi-compartment equations is discussed in appendix B. Using thisscheme, models can be integrated numerically with excellent ef \ufb01ciency,\neven those involving large numbers of compartments. Such integrationschemes are built into neuron simulation software packages such as Neu-ron and Genesis.\nAction Potential Propagation Along an Unmyelinated Axon\nAs an example of multi-compartment modeling, we simulate the propa-gation of an action potential along an unmyelinated axon. In this model,each compartment has the same membrane conductances as the single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley model discussed in chapter 5. The dif-ferent compartments are joined together in a single non-branching cablerepresenting a length of axon. Figure 6.17 shows an action potential prop-agating along an axon modeled in this way. The action potential extendsover more than 1 mm of axon and it travels about 2 mm in 5 ms for a speedof 0.4 m/s.\nAlthough action potentials typically move along axons in a direction out-\nward from the soma (called orthodromic propagation), the basic process\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\n50\n-50V1 (mV)10\n10 20 1515 20\n55\n50\n-50V2 (mV)t (ms)t (ms)V2 V1Ie\n50\n-50V (mV)x (mm)23 4 1\nFigure 6.17: Propagation of an action potential along a multi-compartment model\naxon.

The action potential is movingto the right. The bottom two panels show the membrane potential as a functionof time at the two locations denoted by the arrows and symbols V\n1and V2in the\nupper panel.\nof action potential propagation does not favor one direction over the other.\nPropagation in the reverse direction, called antidromic propagation, is orthodromic;\nantidromicpropagationpossible under certain stimulation conditions. For example, if an axon is\nstimulated in the middle of its length, action potentials will propagate inboth directions away from the point of stimulation. Once an action poten-tial starts moving along an axon, it does not generate a second action po-tential moving in the opposite direction because of refractory effects. Theregion in front of a moving action potential is ready to generate a spikeas soon as enough current moves longitudinally down the axon from theregion currently spiking to charge the next region up to spiking threshold.However, Na\n+conductances in the region just behind the moving action\npotential are still partially inactivated, so this region cannot generated an-other spike until after a recovery period. By the time the trailing regionhas recovered, the action potential has moved too far away to generate asecond spike.\nRefractoriness following spiking has a number of other consequences for\naction potential propagation. Two action potentials moving in oppo-site directions that collide annihilate each other because they cannot passthrough each other\u2019s trailing refractory regions. Refractoriness also keeps\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

This is proportional to\nthe square root of the axon radius. The square-root dependence of thepropagation speed on the axon radius means that thick axons are requiredto achieve high action potential propagation speeds, and the squid giantaxon is an extreme example. Action potential propagation can also be spedup by covering the axon with an insulating myelin wrapping, as we dis-cuss next.\nPropagation Along a Myelinated Axon\nMany axons in vertebrates are covered with an insulating sheath ofmyelin, except at gaps, called the nodes of Ranvier, where there is a highdensity of fast voltage-dependent Na\n+channels and other ion channels\n(see\ufb01gure 6.18A). The myelin sheath consists of many layers of (glial cell)\nmembrane wrapped around the axon. This gives the myelinated region ofthe axon a very high membrane resistance and a small membrane capaci-tance. This results in what is called saltatory propagation, in which mem- saltatory\npropagation brane potential depolarization is transferred passively down the myelin-\ncovered sections of the axon, and action potentials are actively regeneratedat the nodes of Ranvier. The cell membrane at the nodes of Ranvier has ahigh density of fast Na\n+channels. Figure 6.18A shows an equivalent cir-\ncuit for a multi-compartment model of a myelinated axon.\nWe can compute the capacitance of a myelin-covered axon by treating the\nmyelin sheath as an extremely thick cell membrane. Consider the geom-etry shown in the cross-sectional diagram of \ufb01gure 6.18B. The myelin\nsheath extends from the radius a\n1of the axon core to the outer radius\na2. For calculational purposes, we can think of the myelin sheath as be-\ning made of a series of thin concentric cylindrical shells. The capacitancesof these shells combine in series to make up the full capacitance of themyelinated axon.

The myelinated segments arerepresented by a membrane capacitance, a longitudinal resistance, and a leakageconductance. The nodes of Ranvier also contain a voltage-dependent Na\n+conduc-\ntance. B) A cross-section of a myelinated axon consisting of a central axon core ofradius a\n1and a myelin sheath making the outside radius a2.\nA re-evaluation of the derivation of the linear cable equation earlier in\nthis chapter indicates that the equation describing the membrane potentialalong the myelinated sections of an axon, in the limit of in \ufb01nite resistance\nfor the myelinated membrane and with i\ne=0, is\nCm\nL\u2202v\n\u2202t=\u03c0a2\n1\nrL\u22022v\n\u2202x2. (6.32)\nThis is equivalent to the diffusion equation, \u2202v/\u2202 t=D\u22022v/\u2202x2with diffu-\nsion constant D=\u03c0a2\n1L/(CmrL)=a2\n1ln(a2/a1)/(2cmrLdm). It is interesting\nto compute the inner core radius, a1, that maximizes this diffusion con-\nstant for a \ufb01xed outer radius a2. Setting the derivative of Dwith respect to\na1to zero gives the optimal inner radius a1=a2exp(\u22121/2)ora1\u22480.6a2.\nAn inner core fraction of 0.6 is typical for myelinated axons. This indi-cates that, for a given outer radius, the thickness of myelin maximizes thediffusion constant along the myelinated axon segment.\nAt the optimal ratio of radii, D\n=a2\n2/(4ecmrLdm), which is proportional to\nthe square of the axon radius. Because of the form of the diffusion equationit obeys with this value of D,\nvcan be written as a function of x/a2and t.\nThis scaling implies that the propagation velocity for a meylinated cableis proportional to a\n2, that is, to the axon radius not its square root as in\nthe case of an unmyelinated axon. Increasing the axon radius by a factorof four, for example, increases the propagation speed of an unmyelinatedcable only by a factor of two, while it increases the speed for a myelinatedcable fourfold.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

We introduced A-type K\n+,\ntransient Ca2+, and Ca2+-dependent K+conductances and noted their ef-\nfect on neuronal activity. The cable equation and its linearized versionwere introduced to examine the effects of morphology on membrane po-tentials. Finally, multi-compartment models were presented and used todiscuss propagation of action potentials along unmyelinated and myeli-nated axons.\n6.6 Appendices\nA) Gating Functions for Conductance-Based Models\nConnor-Stevens Model\nThe rate functions used for the gating variables n,m, and hof the Connor-\nStevens model, in units of 1/ms with Vin units of mV , are\n\u03b1m=0.38(V+29.7)\n1\u2212exp[\u22120.1(V+29.7)]\u03b2m=15.2 exp[\u22120.0556(V+54.7)]\n\u03b1h=0.266 exp[ \u22120.05(V+48)]\u03b2h=3.8/(1+exp[\u22120.1(V+18)])\n\u03b1n=0.02(V+45.7)\n1\u2212exp[\u2212.1(V+45.7)]\u03b2n=0.25 exp[ \u22120.0125(V+55.7)].(6.33)\nThe A-current is described directly in terms of the asymptotic values and\n\u03c4functions for its gating variables (with \u03c4aand\u03c4bin units of ms and Vin\nunits of mV),\na\u221e=/bracketleftbigg0.0761 exp[0 .0314(V+94.22)]\n1+exp[0.0346(V+1.17)]/bracketrightbigg1/3\n(6.34)\n\u03c4a=0.3632+1.158/(1+exp[0.0497(V+55.96)]) (6.35)\nb\u221e=/bracketleftbigg1\n1+exp[0.0688(V+53.3)]/bracketrightbigg4\n(6.36)\nand\n\u03c4b=1.24+2.678/(1+exp[0.0624(V+50)]).

(6.43)\nB) Integrating Multi-Compartment Models\nMulti-compartmental models are de \ufb01ned by a coupled set of differential\nequations (equation 6.29), one for each compartment. There are also gat-ing variables for each compartment, but these only involve the membranepotential (and possibly Ca\n2+concentration) within that compartment, and\nintegrating their equations can be handled as in the single-compartmentcase using the approach discussed in appendix B of chapter 5. Integratingthe membrane potentials for the different compartments is more complexbecause they are coupled to each other.\nEquation 6.29 for the membrane potential within compartment\n\u00b5can be\nwritten in the form\ndV\u00b5\ndt=A\u00b5V\u00b5\u22121+B\u00b5V\u00b5+C\u00b5V\u00b5+1+D\u00b5 (6.44)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.6 Appendices 33\nwhere\nA\u00b5=c\u22121\nmg\u00b5,\u00b5\u22121, B\u00b5=\u2212 c\u22121\nm(/summationdisplay\nig\u00b5\ni+g\u00b5,\u00b5+1+g\u00b5,\u00b5\u22121),\nC\u00b5=c\u22121\nmg\u00b5,\u00b5+1, and D\u00b5=c\u22121\nm(/summationdisplay\nig\u00b5\niEi+I\u00b5\ne/A\u00b5). (6.45)\nNote that the gating variables and other parameters have been absorbed\ninto the values of A\u00b5,B\u00b5,C\u00b5, and D\u00b5in this equation. Equation 6.44, with\n\u00b5running over all of the compartments of the model, generates a set of\ncoupled differential equations. Because of the coupling between compart-ments, we cannot use the method discussed in appendix A of chapter 5 tointegrate these equations. Instead, we present another method that sharessome of the positive features of that method.\nTwo of the most important features of an integration method are accuracy\nand stability. Accuracy refers to how closely numerical \ufb01nite-difference\nmethods reproduce the exact solution of a differential equation as a func-tion of the integration step size\n/Delta1t. Stability refers to what happens when\n/Delta1tis chosen to be excessively large and the method starts to become in-\naccurate. A stable integration method will degrade smoothly as /Delta1tis in-\ncreased, producing results of steadily decreasing accuracy. An unstablemethod, on the other hand, will, at some point, display a sudden transitionand generate wildly inaccurate results. Given the tendency of impatientmodelers to push the limits on\n/Delta1t, it is highly desirable to have a method\nthat is stable.\nDe\ufb01ning\nV\u00b5(t+/Delta1t)=V\u00b5(t)+/Delta1V\u00b5, (6.46)\nthe\ufb01nite difference form of equation 6.44 gives the update rule\n/Delta1V\u00b5=/parenleftbig\nA\u00b5V\u00b5\u22121(t)+B\u00b5V\u00b5(t)+C\u00b5V\u00b5+1(t)+D\u00b5/parenrightbig/Delta1t (6.47)\nwhich is how /Delta1V\u00b5is computed using the so-called Euler method. This\nmethod is both inaccurate and unstable. The stability of the method canbe improved dramatically by evaluating the membrane potentials on theright side of equation 6.47 not at time t, but at a later time t\n+z/Delta1t, so that\n/Delta1V\u00b5=/parenleftbig\nA\u00b5V\u00b5\u22121(t+z/Delta1t)+B\u00b5V\u00b5(t+z/Delta1t)+C\u00b5V\u00b5+1(t+z/Delta1t)+D\u00b5/parenrightbig/Delta1t.\n(6.48)\nTwo such methods are predominantly used, the reverse Euler method for\nwhich z=1 and the Crank-Nicholson method with z=0.5. The reverse\nEuler method is the more stable of the two and the Crank-Nicholson isthe more accurate. In either case,\n/Delta1V\u00b5is determined from equation 6.48.\nThese methods are called implicit because equation 6.48 must be solvedto determine\n/Delta1V\u00b5. To do this, we write V\u00b5(t+z/Delta1t)\u2248V\u00b5(t)+z/Delta1V\u00b5and\nlikewise for V\u00b5\u00b11. Substituting this into equation 6.48 gives\n/Delta1V\u00b5=a\u00b5/Delta1V\u00b5\u22121+b\u00b5/Delta1V\u00b5+c\u00b5/Delta1V\u00b5+1+d\u00b5 (6.49)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Model Neurons II: Conductances and Morphology\nwhere\na\u00b5=A\u00b5z/Delta1t,b\u00b5=B\u00b5z/Delta1t,c\u00b5=C\u00b5z/Delta1t,and\nd\u00b5=(D\u00b5+A\u00b5V\u00b5\u22121(t)+B\u00b5V\u00b5(t)+C\u00b5V\u00b5+1(t))/Delta1t. (6.50)\nEquation 6.49 for all \u00b5values provides a set of coupled linear equations for\nthe quantities /Delta1V\u00b5.A ne f \ufb01cient method exists for solving these equations\n(Hines 1984, Tuckwell 1988). We illustrate the method for a single, non-branching cable that begins with at compartment\n\u00b5=1, so that a1=0, and\nends at compartment \u00b5=N,s o cN=0. The method consists of solving\nequation 6.49 for /Delta1V\u00b5in terms of /Delta1V\u00b5+1sequentially starting at one end\nof the cable and proceeding to the other end. For example, if we start theprocedure at compartment one,\n/Delta1V1can be expressed as\n/Delta1V1=c1/Delta1V2+d1\n1\u2212b1. (6.51)\nSubstituting this into the equation 6.49 for \u00b5=2 gives\n/Delta1V2=b/prime\n2/Delta1V2+c2/Delta1V3+d/prime\n2 (6.52)\nwhere b/prime\n2=b2+a2c1/(1\u2212b1)and d/prime\n2=d2+a2d1/(1\u2212b1). We now repeat\nthe procedure going down the cable. At each stage, we solve for /Delta1V\u00b5\u22121in\nterms of /Delta1V\u00b5\ufb01nding\n/Delta1V\u00b5\u22121=c\u00b5\u22121/Delta1V\u00b5+d/prime\n\u00b5\u22121\n1\u2212b/prime\n\u00b5\u22121.

(6.55)\nFinally, when we get to the end of the cable we can solve for\n/Delta1VN=d/prime\nN\n1\u2212b/prime\nN(6.56)\nbecause cN=0.\nThe procedure for computing all the /Delta1V\u00b5is the following. De \ufb01neb/prime\n1=b1\nand d/prime\n1=d1and iterate equations 6.54 and 6.55 down the length of the cable\nto de\ufb01ne all the b/primeand d/primeparameters. Then, solve for /Delta1VNfrom equation\n6.56 and iterate back up the cable solving for the /Delta1V\u2019s using 6.53. This\nprocess takes only 2 Nsteps.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n6.7 Annotated Bibliography 35\nWe leave the extension of this method to the case of a branched cable as\nan exercise for the reader. The general procedure is similar to the one wepresented for an non-branching cable. The equations are solved startingat the ends of the branches and moving in toward their branching node,then continuing on as for an non-branching cable, and \ufb01nally reversing\ndirection and completing the solution moving in the opposite directionalong the cable and its branches.\n6.7 Annotated Bibliography\nMany of the references for chapter 5 apply to this chapter as well, includ-ingJack et al.

For ex-\nample, neurons in the mammalian neocortex each receive thousands ofsynaptic inputs. Network models allow us to explore the computationalpotential of such connectivity, using both analysis and simulations. Asillustrations, we study in this chapter how networks can perform the fol-lowing tasks: coordinate transformations needed in visually guided reach-ing, selective ampli \ufb01cation leading to models of simple and complex cells\nin primary visual cortex, integration as a model of short-term memory,noise reduction, input selection, gain modulation, and associative mem-ory. Networks that undergo oscillations are also analyzed, with applica-tion to the olfactory bulb. Finally, we discuss network models based onstochastic rather than deterministic dynamics, using the Boltzmann ma-chine as an example.\nNeocortical circuits are a major focus of our discussion. In the neocor-\ntex, which forms the convoluted outer surface of the (for example) humanbrain, neurons lie in six vertical layers highly coupled within cylindricalcolumns. Such columns have been suggested as basic functional units, and cortical columns\nstereotypical patterns of connections both within a column and betweencolumns are repeated across cortex. There are three main classes of inter-connections within cortex, and in other areas of the brain as well. Feed-forward connections bring input to a given region from another region lo- feedforward,\nrecurrent, and\ntop-down\nconnectionscated at an earlier stage along a particular processing pathway. Recurrent\nsynapses interconnect neurons within a particular region that are consid-ered to be at the same stage along the processing pathway. These may in-clude connections within a cortical column as well as connections betweenboth nearby and distant cortical columns within a region. Top-down con-nections carry signals back from areas located at later stages. These de \ufb01ni-\ntions depend on the how the region being studied is speci \ufb01ed and on the\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Network Models\nhierarchical assignment of regions along a pathway. In general, neurons\nwithin a given region send top-down projections back to the areas fromwhich they receive feedforward input, and receive top-down input fromthe areas to which they project feedforward output. The numbers, thoughnot necessarily the strengths, of feedforward and top-down \ufb01bers between\nconnected regions are typically comparable, and recurrent synapses typi-cally outnumber feedforward or top-down inputs. We begin this chapterby studying networks with purely feedforward input and then study theeffects of recurrent connections. The analysis of top-down connections, forwhich it is more dif \ufb01cult to establish clear computational roles, is left until\nchapter 10.\nThe most direct way to simulate neural networks is to use the methods dis-\ncussed in chapters 5 and 6 to synaptically connect model spiking neurons.This is a worthwhile and instructive enterprise, but it presents signi \ufb01cant\ncomputational, calculational, and interpretational challenges. In this chap-ter, we follow a simpler approach and construct networks of neuron-likeunits with outputs consisting of \ufb01ring rates rather than action potentials.\nSpiking models involve dynamics over time scales ranging from channelopenings that can take less than a millisecond, to collective network pro-cesses that may be several orders of magnitude slower. Firing-rate modelsavoid the short time scale dynamics required to simulate action potentialsand thus are much easier to simulate on computers. Firing-rate modelsalso allow us to present analytic calculations of some aspects of networkdynamics that could not be treated in the case of spiking neurons. Finally,spiking models tend to have more free parameters than \ufb01ring-rate models,\nand setting these appropriately can be dif \ufb01cult.\nThere are two additional arguments in favor of \ufb01ring-rate models. The\n\ufb01rst concerns the apparent stochasticity of spiking. The models discussed\nin chapters 5 and 6 produce spike sequences deterministically in responseto injected current or synaptic input. Deterministic models can only pre-dict spike sequences accurately if all their inputs are known. This is un-likely to be the case for the neurons in a complex network, and networkmodels typically include only a subset of the many different inputs to indi-vidual neurons. Therefore, the greater apparent precision of spiking mod-els may not actually be realized in practice. If necessary, \ufb01ring-rate models\ncan be used to generate stochastic spike sequences from a deterministicallycomputed rate, using the methods discussed in chapters 1 and 2.\nThe second argument comes involves a complication with spiking models\nthat arises when they are used to construct simpli \ufb01ed networks. Although\ncortical neurons receive many inputs, the probability of \ufb01nding a synaptic\nconnection between a randomly chosen pair of neurons is actually quitelow. Capturing this feature, while retaining a high degree of connectiv-ity through polysynaptic pathways, requires including a large number ofneurons in a network model. A standard way of dealing with this problemis to use a single model unit to represent the average response of severalneurons that have similar selectivities. These \u2018averaging\u2019 units can then\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.2 Firing-Rate Models 3\nbe interconnected more densely than the individual neurons of the actual\nnetwork, and so fewer of them are needed to build the model. If neuralresponses are characterized by \ufb01ring rates, the output of the model unit is\nsimply the average of the \ufb01ring rates of the neurons it represents collec-\ntively. However, if the response is a spike, it is not clear how the spikesof the represented neurons can be averaged. The way spiking models aretypically constructed, an action potential \ufb01red by the model unit dupli-\ncates the effect of all the neurons it represents \ufb01ring synchronously. Not\nsurprisingly, such models tend to exhibit large-scale synchronization un-like anything seen in a healthy brain.\nFiring-rate models also have their limitations. Most importantly, they can-\nnot account for aspects of spike timing and spike correlations that may beimportant for understanding nervous system function. Firing-rate modelsare restricted to cases where the \ufb01ring of neurons in a network is uncor-\nrelated, with little synchronous \ufb01ring, and where precise patterns spike\ntiming are unimportant. In such cases, comparisons of spiking networkmodels with models that use \ufb01ring-rate descriptions have shown that they\nproduce similar results. Nevertheless, the exploration of neural networksundoubtedly requires the use of both \ufb01ring-rate and spiking models.\n7.2 Firing-Rate Models\nAs discussed in chapter 1, the sequence of spikes generated by a neuron\nis completely characterized by the neural response function \u03c1(t), which\nconsists of \u03b4function spikes located at times when the neuron \ufb01red action\npotentials. In \ufb01ring-rate models, the exact description of a spike sequence\nprovided by the neural response function \u03c1(t)is replaced by the approxi-\nmate description provided by the \ufb01ring rate r(t). Recall from chapter 1 that\nr(t)is de\ufb01ned as the probability density of \ufb01ring and is obtained from \u03c1(t)\nby averaging over trials. The validity of a \ufb01ring-rate model depends on\nhow well the trial-averaged \ufb01ring rate of network units approximates the\neffect of actual spike sequences on the dynamic behavior of the network.\nThe replacement of the neural response function by the corresponding \ufb01r-\ning rate is typically justi \ufb01ed by the fact that each network neuron has a\nlarge number of inputs. Replacing \u03c1(t), which describes an actual spike\ntrain, by the trial-averaged \ufb01ring rate r(t)is justi \ufb01ed if the quantities of\nrelevance for network dynamics are relatively insensitive to the trial-to-trial\ufb02uctuations in the spike sequences represented by\n\u03c1(t). In a network\nmodel, the relevant quantities that must be modeled accurately are thetotal inputs to all the neurons in the network. For any single synaptic in-put, the trial-to-trial variability is likely to be large. However, if we sumthe input over many synapses activated by uncorrelated presynaptic spiketrains, the mean of the total input typically grows linearly with the numberof synapses, while its standard deviation grows only as the square root ofthe number of synapses. Thus, for uncorrelated presynaptic spike trains,\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Network Models\nusing presynaptic \ufb01ring rates in place of the actual presynaptic spike trains\nmay not signi \ufb01cantly modify the dynamics of the network. Conversely, a\n\ufb01ring-rate model will fail to describe a network adequately if the presy-\nnaptic inputs to a substantial fraction of its neurons are correlated. Thiscan occur, for example, if the presynaptic neurons \ufb01re synchronously.\nThe synaptic input arising from a presynaptic spike train is effectively \ufb01l-\ntered by the dynamics of the conductance changes that each presynapticaction potential evokes in the postsynaptic neuron (see chapter 5), and thedynamics of propagation of the current from the synapse to the soma. Thetemporal averaging provided by slow synaptic or membrane dynamicscan reduce the effects of spike train variability and help justify the approx-imation of using \ufb01ring rates instead of presynaptic spike trains. Firing-rate\nmodels are more accurate if the network being modeled has a signi \ufb01cant\namount of synaptic transmission that is slow relative to typical presynap-tic interspike intervals.\nThe construction of a \ufb01ring-rate model proceeds in two steps. First, we\ndetermine how the total synaptic input to a neuron depends on the \ufb01r-\ning rates of its presynaptic afferents. This is where we use \ufb01ring rates to\napproximate neural response functions. Second, we model how the \ufb01ring\nrate of the postsynaptic neuron depends on its total synaptic input. Firing-rate response curves are typically measured by injecting current into thesoma of a neuron. We therefore \ufb01nd it most convenient to de \ufb01ne the total\nsynaptic input as the total current delivered to the soma as a result of allthe synaptic conductance changes resulting from presynaptic action po-tentials. We denote this total synaptic current by I\ns. We then determine synaptic current I s\nthe postsynaptic \ufb01ring rate from Is. In general, Isdepends on the spa-\ntially inhomogeneous membrane potential of the neuron, but we assumethat, other than during action potentials or transient hyperpolarizations,the membrane potential remains close to, but slightly below, the thresh-old for action potential generation. An example of this type of behavioris seen in the upper panels of \ufb01gure 7.2. I\nsis then approximately equal to\nthe synaptic current that would be measured from the soma in a voltage-clamp experiment, except for a reversal of sign. In the next section, wemodel how I\nsdepends on presynaptic \ufb01ring rates.\nIn the network models we consider, both the output from, and input to, a\nneuron are characterized by \ufb01ring rates. To avoid a proliferation of sub-\nand superscripts on the quantity r(t), we use the letter uto denote a presy-\nnaptic \ufb01ring rate, and vto denote a postsynaptic rate. Note that vis used input rate u\noutput rate v here to denote a \ufb01ring rate, not a membrane potential. In addition, we use\nthese two letters to distinguish input and output \ufb01ring rates in network\nmodels, a convention we retain through the remaining chapters. Whenwe consider multiple input or output neurons, we use vectors uand vto input rate vector u\noutput rate vector vrepresent their \ufb01ring rates collectively, with the components of these vec-\ntors representing the \ufb01ring rates of the individual input and output units.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.2 Firing-Rate Models 5\nThe Total Synaptic Current\nConsider a neuron receiving Nusynaptic inputs labeled by b=1,2,..., Nu\n(\ufb01gure 7.1). The \ufb01ring rate of input bis denoted by ub, and the input rates\nare represented collectively by the Nu-component vector u. We model how\nthe synaptic current Isdepends on presynaptic \ufb01ring rates by \ufb01rst consid-\nering how it depends on presynaptic spikes. If an action potential arrivesat input bat time zero, we write the synaptic current generated in the soma\nof the postsynaptic neuron at time tas\nwbKs(t)where wbis the synaptic\nweight and Ks(t)is called the synaptic kernel. Collectively, the synap-\ntic weights are represented by a synaptic weight vector w, which has Nusynaptic weights w\ncomponents wb. The amplitude and sign of the synaptic current generated\nby input bare determined by wb. For excitatory synapses, wb>0, and for\ninhibitory synapses, wb<0. In this formulation of the effect of presynaptic\nspikes, the probability of transmitter release from a presynaptic terminal isabsorbed into the synaptic weight factor\nwb, and we do not include short-\nterm plasticity in the model (although this can be done by making wba\ndynamic variable).\nThe synaptic kernel, Ks(t)\u22650, describes the time course of the synaptic synaptic kernel\nKs(t) current in response to a presynaptic spike arriving at time t=0. This time\ncourse depends on the dynamics of the synaptic conductance activated bythe presynaptic spike and also on both the passive and active propertiesof the dendritic cables that carry the synaptic current to the soma. Forexample, long passive cables broaden the synaptic kernel and slow its risefrom zero. Cable calculations or multicompartment simulations, such asthose discussed in chapter 6, can be used to compute K\ns(t)f o ras p e c i \ufb01c\ndendritic structure. To avoid ambiguity, we normalize Ks(t)by requiring\nits integral over all positive times to be one. At this point, for simplicity,we use the same function K\ns(t)to describe all synapses.\noutput v\ninput uweights w\nFigure 7.1: Feedforward inputs to a single neuron.

The equality follows from integrating over the sum of \u03b4\nfunctions in the de \ufb01nition of \u03c1b(\u03c4). If there is no nonlinear interaction be-\ntween different synaptic currents, the total synaptic current coming fromall presynaptic inputs is obtained simply by summing,\nI\ns=Nu/summationdisplay\nb=1wb/integraldisplayt\n\u2212\u221ed\u03c4Ks(t\u2212\u03c4)\u03c1 b(\u03c4). (7.2)\nAs discussed previously, the critical step in the construction of a \ufb01ring-rate\nmodel is the replacement of the neural response function \u03c1b(\u03c4)in equation\n7.2 by the \ufb01ring rate of neuron b, namely ub(\u03c4), so that we write\nIs=Nu/summationdisplay\nb=1wb/integraldisplayt\n\u2212\u221ed\u03c4Ks(t\u2212\u03c4)ub(\u03c4). (7.3)\nThe synaptic kernel most frequently used in \ufb01ring-rate models is an expo-\nnential, Ks(t)=exp(\u2212t/\u03c4r)/\u03c4 r. With this kernel, we can describe Isby a\ndifferential equation if we take the derivative of equation 7.3 with respecttot,\n\u03c4sdIs\ndt=\u2212 Is+Nu/summationdisplay\nb=1wbub=\u2212 Is+w\u00b7u. (7.4)\nIn the second equality, we have expressed the sum/summationtextwbubas the dot\nproduct of the weight and input vectors, w\u00b7u. In this and the follow- dot product\ning chapters, we primarily use the vector versions of equations such asequation 7.4, but when we \ufb01rst introduce an important new equation, we\noften write it in its subscripted form as well.\nRecall that Kdescribes the temporal evolution of the synaptic current due\nto both synaptic conductance and dendritic cable effects. For an electro-tonically compact dendritic structure,\n\u03c4swill be close to the time constant\nthat describes the decay of the synaptic conductance. For fast synapticconductances such as those due to AMPA glutamate receptors, this maybe as short as a few milliseconds. For a long, passive dendritic cable,\n\u03c4s\nmay be larger than this, but its measured value is typically quite small.\nThe Firing-Rate\nEquation 7.4 determines the synaptic current entering the soma of a post-\nsynaptic neuron in terms of the \ufb01ring rates of the presynaptic neurons. To\n\ufb01nish formulating a \ufb01ring-rate model, we must determine the postsynap-\ntic\ufb01ring rate from our knowledge of Is. For constant synaptic current, the\n\ufb01ring rate of the postsynaptic neuron can be expressed as v=F(Is), where\nFis the steady-state \ufb01ring rate as a function of somatic input current. F\nis also called an activation function. Fis sometimes taken to be a satu- activation\nfunction F (Is) rating function such as a sigmoid function. This is useful in cases where\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.2 Firing-Rate Models 7\nthe derivative of Fis needed in the analysis of network dynamics. It is\nalso bounded from above, which can be important in stabilizing a networkagainst excessively high \ufb01ring rates. More often, we use a threshold linear\nfunction F\n(Is)=[Is\u2212\u03b3]+, where \u03b3is the threshold and the notation [ ] + threshold \u03b3\ndenotes half-wave recti \ufb01cation as in previous chapters. For convenience,\nwe treat Isin this expression as if its were measured in units of a \ufb01ring rate\n(Hz), i.e. as if Isis multiplied by a constant that converts its units from nA\nto Hz. This makes the synaptic weights dimensionless. The threshold \u03b3\nalso has units of Hz.\nFor time-independent inputs, the relation v=F(Is)is all we need to know\nto complete the \ufb01ring-rate model. The total steady-state synaptic current\npredicted by equation 7.4 for time-independent uisIs=w\u00b7u. This gener-\nates a steady-state output \ufb01ring rate v=v\u221egiven by\nv\u221e=F(w\u00b7u). (7.5)\nThe steady-state \ufb01ring rate tells us how a neuron responds to constant cur-\nrent, but not to a current that changes with time. To model time-dependentinputs, we need to know the \ufb01ring rate in response to a time-dependent\nsynaptic current I\ns(t). The simplest assumption is that this is still given\nby the activation function, so v=F(Is(t))even when the total synaptic\ncurrent varies with time. This leads to a \ufb01ring-rate model in which all the\ndynamics arise exclusively from equation 7.4, \ufb01ring-rate model\nwith current\ndynamics\u03c4sdIs\ndt=\u2212 Is+w\u00b7uwith v=F(Is). (7.6)\nAn alternative formulation of a \ufb01ring-rate model can be constructed by\nassuming that the \ufb01ring rate does not follow changes in the total synaptic\ncurrent instantaneously, as was assumed for the model of equation 7.6. Ac-tion potentials are generated by the synaptic current through its effect onthe membrane potential of the neuron. Due to the membrane capacitanceand resistance, the membrane potential is, roughly speaking, a low-pass\ufb01ltered version of I\ns(see the Mathematical Appendix). For this reason, the\ntime-dependent \ufb01ring rate is often modeled as a low-pass \ufb01ltered version\nof the steady-state \ufb01ring rate,\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+F(Is(t)). (7.7)\nThe constant \u03c4rin this equation determines how rapidly the \ufb01ring rate\napproaches its steady-state value for constant Is, and how closely vcan\nfollow rapid \ufb02uctuations for a time-dependent Is(t). Equivalently, it mea-\nsures the time-scale over which vaverages F(Is(t)). The low-pass \ufb01ltering\neffect of equation 7.7 is described in the Mathematical Appendix in thecontext of electrical circuit theory. The argument we have used to moti-vate equation 7.7 would suggest that\n\u03c4rshould be approximately equal to\nthe membrane time constant of the neuron. However, this argument really\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Network Models\napplies to the membrane potential not the \ufb01ring rate, and the dynamics of\nthe two are not the same. Most network models use a value of \u03c4rthat is\nconsiderably less than the membrane time constant. We re-examine thisissue in the following section.\nThe second model that we have described involves the pair of equa-\ntions 7.4 and 7.7. If one of these equations relaxes to its equilibrium pointmuch more rapidly than the other, the pair can be reduced to a single equa-tion. For example, if\n\u03c4r/lessmuch\u03c4s, we can make the approximation that equation\n7.7 rapidly sets v=F(Is(t)), and then the second model reduces to the \ufb01rst\nmodel that is de \ufb01ned by equation 7.6. If instead, \u03c4r/greatermuch\u03c4s, we can make the\napproximation that equation 7.4 comes to equilibrium quickly comparedto equation 7.7. Then, we can make the replacement I\ns=w\u00b7uin equation\n7.7 and write \ufb01ring-rate equation\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+F(w\u00b7u). (7.8)\nFor most of this chapter, we analyze network models described by the\n\ufb01ring-rate dynamics of equation 7.8, although occasionally we consider\nnetworks based on equation 7.6.\nFiring-Rate Dynamics\nThe\ufb01ring-rate models described by equations 7.6 and 7.8 differ in their\nassumptions about how \ufb01ring rates respond to and track changes in the\ninput current to a neuron. In one case (equation 7.6), it is assumed that\ufb01ring rates follow time varying input currents instantaneously without\nattenuation or delay. In the other case (equation 7.8), the \ufb01ring rate is a\nlow-pass \ufb01ltered version of the input current. To study the relationship\nbetween input current and \ufb01ring rate, it is useful to examine the \ufb01ring rate\nof a spiking model neuron in response to a time-varying injected current,\nI\n(t). The model used for this purpose in \ufb01gure 7.2 is an integrate-and- \ufb01re\nneuron receiving balanced excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input alongwith a current injected into the soma that is the sum of constant and oscil-lating components. This model was discussed in chapter 5. The balancedsynaptic input is used to represent background input not included in thecomputation of I\ns, and it acts as a source of noise. The noise prevents ef-\nfects such as locking of the spiking to the oscillations of the injected currentthat would invalidate a \ufb01ring-rate description.\nFigure 7.2 shows the \ufb01ring rates of the model integrate-and- \ufb01re neuron\nin response to an input current I\n(t)=I0+I1cos(\u03c9t).T h e \ufb01ring rate is\nplotted at different times during the cycle of the input current oscillationsfor\n\u03c9corresponding to frequencies of 1, 50, and 100 Hz. For the panels\non the left side, the constant component of the injected current ( I0) was\nadjusted so the neuron never stopped \ufb01ring during the cycle. In this case,\nthe relation v(t)=F(I(t))(solid curves) provides an accurate description\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

As long as\nthe neuron keeps \ufb01ring fairly rapidly, the low-pass \ufb01ltering properties of\nthe membrane potential are not relevant for the dynamics of the \ufb01ring\nrate. Low-pass \ufb01ltering is irrelevant in this case, because the neuron is\ncontinually being shuttled between the threshold and reset values, and soit never has a chance to settle exponentially anywhere near its steady-statevalue.\nThe right panels in \ufb01gure 7.2 show that the situation is different if the\ninput current is below the threshold for \ufb01ring through a signi \ufb01cant part\nof the oscillation cycle. In this case, the \ufb01ring is delayed and attenuated\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Network Models\nat high frequencies as would be predicted by equation 7.7. In this case,\nthe membrane potential stays below threshold for long enough periods oftime that its dynamics become relevant for the \ufb01ring of the neuron.\nThe essential message from \ufb01gure 7.2 is that neither equation 7.6 nor 7.8\nprovides a completely accurate prediction of the dynamics of the \ufb01ring\nrate at all frequencies and for all levels of injected current. A more com-plex model can be constructed that accurately describes the \ufb01ring rate over\nthe entire range of input currents amplitudes and frequencies. The solidcurves in \ufb01gure 7.2 were generated by a model that expresses the \ufb01ring\nrate as a function of both F\n(I)and of vcomputed from equation 7.8 (al-\nthough it reduces to v=F(I(t))in the case of the left panel of \ufb01gure 7.2).\nIn other words, it is a combination of the two models discussed in theprevious section. This compound model provides quite an accurate de-scription of the \ufb01ring rate of the integrate-and- \ufb01re model, but it is more\ncomplex than the models used in this chapter.\nFeedforward and Recurrent Networks\nFigure 7.3 shows examples of network models with feedforward and re-current connectivity. The feedforward network of \ufb01gure 7.3A has N\nvout-\nput units with rates va(a=1,2,..., Nv), denoted collectively by the vector\nv, driven by Nuinput units with rates u. Equations 7.8 and 7.6 can easily\nbe extended to cover this case by replacing the vector of synaptic weightswby a matrix W, with the matrix component W\nabrepresenting the strength\nof the synapse from input unit bto output unit a. Using the formulation of\nequation 7.8, the output \ufb01ring rates are then determined by feedforward model\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+F(W\u00b7u)or\u03c4rdva\ndt=\u2212v+F/parenleftBiggNu/summationdisplay\nb=1Wabub/parenrightBigg\n. (7.9)\nWe use the notation W\u00b7uto denote the vector with components/summationtext\nbWabub.\nThe use of the dot to represent a sum of a product of two quantities overa shared index is borrowed from the notation for the dot product of twovectors. The expression F\n(W\u00b7u)represents the vector with components\nF(/summationtextWabub)fora=1,2,..., Nv.\nThe recurrent network of \ufb01gure 7.3B also has two layers of neurons with\nrates uand v, but in this case the neurons of the output layer are intercon-\nnected with synaptic weights described by a matrix M. Matrix element\nMaa/primedescribes the strength of the synapse from output unit a/primeto output\nunit a. The output rates in this case are determined by recurrent model\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+F(W\u00b7u+M\u00b7v). (7.10)\nIt is often convenient to de \ufb01ne the total feedforward input to each neuron\nin the network of \ufb01gure 7.3B as h=W\u00b7u. Then, the output rates are\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(7.11)\nNeurons are typically classi \ufb01ed as either excitatory or inhibitory, meaning\nthat they have either excitatory or inhibitory effects on all of their postsy-naptic targets. This property is formalized in Dale\u2019s law, which states that Dale\u2019s law\na neuron cannot excite some of its postsynaptic targets and inhibit others.In terms of the elements of M, this means that for each presynaptic neuron\na\n/prime,Maa/primemust have the same sign for all postsynaptic neurons a.T o i m -\npose this restriction, it is convenient to describe excitatory and inhibitoryneurons separately. The \ufb01ring-rate vectors v\nEand vIfor the excitatory and\ninhibitory neurons are then described by a coupled set of equations iden-tical in form to equation 7.11, excitatory-\ninhibitory\nnetwork\n\u03c4EdvE\ndt=\u2212vE+FE(hE+MEE\u00b7vE+MEI\u00b7vI) (7.12)\nand\n\u03c4IdvI\ndt=\u2212vI+FI(hI+MIE\u00b7vE+MII\u00b7vI). (7.13)\nThere are now four synaptic weight matrices describing the four possible\ntypes of neuronal interactions. The elements of MEEand MIEare greater\nthan or equal to zero, and those of MEIand MIIare less than or equal to\nzero. These equations allow the excitatory and inhibitory neurons to havedifferent time constants, activation functions, and feedforward inputs.\nIn this chapter, we consider several recurrent network models described\nby equation 7.11 with a symmetric weight matrix, M\naa/prime=Ma/primeafor all aand\na/prime. Requiring Mto be symmetric simpli \ufb01es the mathematical analysis, but symmetric coupling\nit violates Dale\u2019s law. Suppose, for example, that neuron a, which is exci-\ntatory, and neuron a/prime, which is inhibitory, are mutually connected. Then,\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Network Models\nMaa/primeshould be negative and Ma/primeapositive, so they cannot be equal. Equa-\ntion 7.11 with symmetric Mcan be interpreted as a special case of equa-\ntions 7.12 and 7.13 in which the inhibitory dynamics are instantaneous(\n\u03c4I\u21920) and the inhibitory rates are given by vI=MIEvE.T h i s p r o d u c e s\nan effective recurrent weight matrix M=MEE+MEI\u00b7MIE, which can be\nmade symmetric by the appropriate choice of the dimension and form ofthe matrices M\nEIand MIE. The dynamic behavior of equation 7.11 is re-\nstricted by requiring the matrix Mto be symmetric. For example symmet-\nric coupling typically does not allow for network oscillations. In the latterpart of this chapter, we consider the richer dynamics of models describedby equations 7.12 and 7.13.\nContinuously Labeled Networks\nIt is often convenient to identify each neuron in a network using a pa-rameter that describes some aspect of its selectivity rather than the integerlabel aorb. For example, neurons in primary visual cortex can be charac-\nterized by their preferred orientation angles, preferred spatial phases andfrequencies, or other stimulus-related parameters (see chapter 2). In manyof the examples in this chapter, we consider stimuli characterized by asingle angle\n/Theta1, which represents, for example, the orientation of a visual\nstimulus. Individual neurons are identi \ufb01ed by their preferred stimulus\nangles, which are typically the values of /Theta1for which they \ufb01re at maxi-\nmum rates. Thus, neuron ais identi \ufb01ed by an angle \u03b8a. The weight of\nthe synapse from neuron bor neuron a/primeto neuron ais then expressed as a\nfunction of the preferred stimulus angles \u03b8b,\u03b8a/primeand\u03b8aof the pre- and post-\nsynaptic neurons, Wab=W(\u03b8a,\u03b8b)orMaa/prime=M(\u03b8a,\u03b8a/prime). We often consider\ncases in which these synaptic weight functions depend only on the differ-ence between the pre- and postsynaptic angles, so that W\nab=W(\u03b8a\u2212\u03b8b)\norMaa/prime=M(\u03b8a\u2212\u03b8a/prime).\nIn large networks, the preferred stimulus parameters for different neurons\nwill typically take a wide range of values. In the models we consider,the number of neurons is large and the angles\n\u03b8a, for different values of a\ncover the range from 0 to 2 \u03c0densely. For simplicity, we assume that this\ncoverage is uniform so that the density of coverage, the number of neuronswith preferred angles falling within a unit range, which we denote by\n\u03c1\u03b8, \u03c1\u03b8density of\ncoverage is constant. For mathematical convenience in these cases, we allow the\npreferred angles to take continuous values rather than restricting them tothe actual discrete values\n\u03b8afora=1,2,..., N. Thus, we label the neurons\nby a continuous angle \u03b8and express the \ufb01ring rate as a function of \u03b8, so that\nu(\u03b8)andv(\u03b8) describe the \ufb01ring rates of neurons with preferred angles \u03b8.\nSimilarly, the synaptic weight matrices Wand Mare replaced by functions\nW(\u03b8,\u03b8/prime)and M(\u03b8,\u03b8/prime)that characterizes the strength of synapses from a\npresynaptic neuron with preferred angle \u03b8/primeto a postsynaptic neuron with\npreferred angle \u03b8in the feedforward and recurrent case, respectively.\nIf the number of neurons in a network is large and the density of cover-\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.3 Feedforward Networks 13\nage of preferred stimulus values is high, we can approximate the sums in\nequation 7.10 by integrals over \u03b8/prime. The number of postsynaptic neurons\nwith preferred angles within a range /Delta1\u03b8/primeis\u03c1\u03b8/Delta1\u03b8/prime, so, when we take the\nlimit/Delta1\u03b8/prime\u21920, the integral over \u03b8/primeappears multiplied by the density fac-\ntor\u03c1\u03b8. Thus, in the case of continuous labeling of neurons, equation 7.10\nbecomes (for constant \u03c1\u03b8) continuous model\n\u03c4rdv(\u03b8)\ndt=\u2212v(\u03b8)+F/parenleftbigg\n\u03c1\u03b8/integraldisplay\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0d\u03b8/primeW(\u03b8,\u03b8/prime)u(\u03b8/prime)+M(\u03b8,\u03b8/prime)v(\u03b8/prime)/parenrightbigg\n.(7.14)\nAs we did previously in equation 7.11, we can write the \ufb01rst term inside\nthe integral of this expression as an input function h(\u03b8). We make frequent\nuse of continuous labeling for network models, and we often approximatesums over neurons by integrals over their preferred stimulus parameters.\n7.3 Feedforward Networks\nSubstantial computations can be performed by feedforward networks inthe absence of recurrent connections. Much of the work done on feed-forward networks centers on plasticity and learning, as discussed in thefollowing chapters. Here, we present an example of the computationalpower of feedforward circuits, the calculation of the coordinate transfor-mations needed in visually guided reaching tasks.\nNeural Coordinate Transformations\nReaching for a viewed object requires a number of coordinate transforma-tions that turn information about where the image of the object falls onthe retina into movement commands in shoulder-, arm-, or hand-basedcoordinates. To perform a transformation from retinal to body-based co-ordinates, information about the retinal location of an image and aboutthe direction of gaze relative to the body must be combined. Figure 7.4Aand B illustrate, in a one-dimensional example, how a rotation of the eyesaffects the relationship between gaze direction, retinal location, and loca-tion relative to the body. Figure 7.4C introduces the notation we use. Theangle gdescribes the orientation of a line extending from the head to the\npoint of visual \ufb01xation. The visual stimulus in retinal coordinates is given\nby the angle sbetween this line and a line extending out to the target. The\nangle describing the reach direction, the direction to the target relative tothe body, is the sum s\n+g.\nVisual neurons have receptive \ufb01elds \ufb01xed to speci \ufb01c locations on the\nretina. Neurons in motor areas can display visually evoked responses thatare not tied to speci \ufb01c retinal locations, but rather depend on the relation-\nship of a visual image to various parts of the body.

Surprisingly, when the\nhead of the monkey was held stationary during \ufb01xation on three different\ntargets, the tuning curves did not shift as the eyes rotated ( \ufb01gure 7.5A).\nAlthough the recorded neurons respond to visual stimuli, the responsesdo not depend directly on the location of the image on the retina. Whenthe head of the monkey is rotated but the \ufb01xation point remains the same,\nthe tuning curves shift by precisely the amount of the head rotation ( \ufb01g-\nure 7.5B). Thus, these neurons encode the location of the image in head- orbody-based, not retinal, coordinates.\nTo account for these data, we need to construct a model neuron that is\ndriven by visual input, but that nonetheless has a tuning curve for imagelocation that is not a function of s, the retinal location of the image, but\nofs\n+g, the location of the object in body-based coordinates. A possible\nbasis for this construction is provided by a combined representation of s\nand gby neurons in area 7a in the posterior parietal cortex of the monkey.\nRecordings made in area 7a reveal neurons that \ufb01re at rates that depend on\nboth the location of the stimulating image on the retina and on the direc-tion of gaze ( \ufb01gure 7.6A). The response tuning curves, expressed as func-\ntions of the retinal location of the stimulus, do not shift when the directionof gaze is varied. However, shifts of gaze direction affect the magnitudeof the visual response. Thus, responses in area 7a exhibit gaze-dependentgain modulation of a retinotopic visual receptive \ufb01eld. gain modulation\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Network Models\nFigure 7.6B shows a mathematical description of a gain-modulated tuning\ncurve. The response tuning curve is expressed as a product of a Gaussianfunction of s\n\u2212\u03be, where \u03beis the preferred retinal location ( \u03be=\u221220\u25e6in\ufb01g-\nure 7.6B), and a sigmoid function of g\u2212\u03b3,w h e r e \u03b3is the gaze direction\nproducing half of the maximum gain ( \u03b3=20\u25e6in\ufb01gure 7.6B). Although it\ndoes not correspond to the maximum neural response, we refer to \u03b3as the\n\u2018preferred\u2019 gaze direction.\nTo model a neuron with a body-centered response tuning curve, we con-\nstruct a feedforward network with a single output unit representing, forexample, the premotor neuron shown in \ufb01gure 7.5. The input layer of the\nnetwork consists of a population of area 7a neurons with gain-modulatedresponses similar to those shown in \ufb01gure 7.6B. Neurons with gains that\nboth increase and decrease as a function of gare included in the model.\nThe average \ufb01ring rates of the input layer neurons are described by tuning\ncurves u\n=fu(s\u2212\u03be,g\u2212\u03b3)with the different neurons taking a range of \u03be\nand\u03b3values.\nWe use continuous labeling of neurons, and replace the sum over presy-\nnaptic neurons by an integral over their \u03beand\u03b3values, inserting the ap-\npropriate density factors \u03c1\u03beand\u03c1\u03b3, which we assume are constant. The\nsteady-state response of the single output neuron is determined by thecontinuous analog of equation 7.5. The synaptic weight from a presynap-tic neuron with preferred stimulus location\n\u03beand preferred gaze direction\n\u03b3is denoted by w(\u03be,\u03b3) , so the steady-state response of the output neurons\nis given by\nv\u221e=F/parenleftbigg\n\u03c1\u03be\u03c1\u03b3/integraldisplay\nd\u03bed\u03b3w ( \u03be ,\u03b3) fu(s\u2212\u03be,g\u2212\u03b3)/parenrightbigg\n. (7.15)\nFor the output neuron to respond to stimulus location in body-based coor-\ndinates, its \ufb01ring rate must be a function of s+g. To see if this is possible,\nwe shift the integration variables in 7.15 by \u03be\u2192\u03be\u2212gand\u03b3\u2192\u03b3+g.I g n o r -\ning effects from the end points of the integration (which is valid if sand g\nare not too close to these limits), we \ufb01nd\nv\u221e=F/parenleftbigg\n\u03c1\u03be\u03c1\u03b3/integraldisplay\nd\u03bed\u03b3w ( \u03be\u2212g,\u03b3+g)fu(s+g\u2212\u03be,\u2212\u03b3)/parenrightbigg\n. (7.16)\nThis is a function of s+gprovided that w(\u03be\u2212g,\u03b3+g)=w(\u03be,\u03b3) , which\nholds if w(\u03be,\u03b3) is a function of the sum \u03be+\u03b3. Thus, the coordinate trans-\nformation can be accomplished if the synaptic weight from a given neurondepends only the sum of its preferred retinal and gaze angles. It has beensuggested that weights of this form can arise naturally from random handand gaze movements through correlation-based synaptic modi \ufb01cation of\nthe type discussed in chapter 8.\nFigure 7.5C shows responses predicted by equation 7.15 when the synaptic\nweights are given by a function\nw(\u03be+\u03b3). The retinal location of the tuning\ncurve shifts as a function of gaze direction, but would remain stationary if\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.4 Recurrent Networks 17\nit were plotted instead as a function of s+g. This can be seen by noting\nthat the peaks of all three curves in \ufb01gure 7.5C occur at s+g=0.\nGain-modulated neurons provide a general basis for combining two dif-\nferent input signals in a nonlinear way. In the network we studied, it ispossible to \ufb01nd appropriate synaptic weights\nw(\u03be,\u03b3) to construct output\nneurons with a wide range of response tuning curves expressed as func-tions of sand g. The mechanism by which sensory and modulatory inputs\ncombine in a multiplicative way in gain-modulated neurons is not known.Later in this chapter, we discuss a recurrent network model for generatinggain-modulated responses.\n7.4 Recurrent Networks\nRecurrent networks have richer dynamics than feedforward networks, butthey are more dif \ufb01cult to analyze. To get a feel for recurrent circuitry, we\nbegin by analyzing a linear model, that is, a model for which the rela-tionship between \ufb01ring rate and synaptic current is linear, F\n(h+M\u00b7r)=\nh+M\u00b7r. The linear approximation is a drastic one that allows, among\nother things, the components of vto become negative, which is impossi-\nble for real \ufb01ring rates. Furthermore, some of the features we discuss in\nconnection with linear, as opposed to nonlinear, recurrent networks canalso be achieved by a feedforward architecture. Nevertheless, the linearmodel is extremely useful for exploring properties of recurrent circuits,and this approach will be used both here and in the following chapters. Inaddition, the analysis of linear networks forms the basis for studying thestability properties of nonlinear networks. We augment the discussion oflinear networks with results from simulations of nonlinear networks.\nLinear Recurrent Networks\nUnder the linear approximation, the recurrent model of equation 7.11 takesthe form linear recurrent\nmodel\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+h+M\u00b7v. (7.17)\nBecause the model is linear, we can solve analytically for the vector of\noutput rates vin terms of the feedforward inputs hand the initial values\nv(0). The analysis is simplest when the recurrent synaptic weight matrix is\nsymmetric, and we assume this to be the case. Equation 7.17 can be solvedby expressing vin terms of the eigenvectors of M. The eigenvectors e\n\u00b5for\n\u00b5=1,2,..., Nvsatisfy eigenvector e\nM\u00b7e\u00b5=\u03bb\u00b5e\u00b5 (7.18)\nfor some value of the constant \u03bb\u00b5which is called the eigenvalue. For a eigenvalue \u03bb\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Network Models\nsymmetric matrix, the eigenvectors are orthogonal, and they can be nor-\nmalized to unit length so that e\u00b5\u00b7e\u03bd=\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd. Such eigenvectors de \ufb01ne an\northogonal coordinate system or basis that can be used to represent any\nNv-dimensional vector. In particular, we can write eigenvector\nexpansion\nv(t)=Nv/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1c\u00b5(t)e\u00b5 (7.19)\nwhere c\u00b5(t)for\u00b5=1,2,..., Nvare a set of time-dependent coef \ufb01cients\ndescribing v(t).\nIt is easier to solve equation 7.17 for the coef \ufb01cients c\u00b5than for vdirectly.\nSubstituting the expansion 7.19 into equation 7.17 and using property 7.18,we\ufb01nd that\n\u03c4rNv/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1dc\u00b5\ndte\u00b5=\u2212Nv/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1(1\u2212\u03bb\u00b5)c\u00b5(t)e\u00b5+h. (7.20)\nThe sum over \u00b5can be eliminated by taking the dot product of each side of\nthis equation with one of the eigenvectors, e\u03bd, and using the orthogonality\nproperty e\u00b5\u00b7e\u03bd=\u03b4\u00b5\u03bdto obtain\n\u03c4rdc\u03bd\ndt=\u2212(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd)c\u03bd(t)+e\u03bd\u00b7h. (7.21)\nThe critical feature of this equation is that it involves only one of the co-\nef\ufb01cients, c\u03bd. For time-independent inputs h, the solution of equation 7.44\nis\nc\u03bd(t)=e\u03bd\u00b7h\n1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd/parenleftbigg\n1\u2212exp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212t(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd)\n\u03c4r/parenrightbigg/parenrightbigg\n+c\u03bd(0)exp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212t(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd)\n\u03c4r/parenrightbigg\n(7.22)\nwhere c\u03bd(0)is the value of c\u03bdat time zero, which is given in terms of the\ninitial \ufb01ring-rate vector v(0)byc\u03bd(0)=e\u03bd\u00b7v(0).\nEquation 7.22 has several important characteristics. If \u03bb\u03bd>1, the exponen-\ntial functions grow without bound as time increases, re \ufb02ecting a funda-\nmental instability of the network. If \u03bb\u03bd<1,c\u03bdapproaches the steady-state\nvalue e\u03bd\u00b7h/(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd)exponentially with time constant \u03c4r/(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd). This\nsteady-state value is proportional to e\u03bd\u00b7h, which is the projection of the\ninput vector onto the relevant eigenvector. For 0 <\u03bb\u03bd<1, the steady-state\nvalue is ampli \ufb01ed relative to this projection by the factor 1 /(1\u2212\u03bb\u03bd), which\nis greater than one. The approach to equilibrium is slowed relative to thebasic time constant\n\u03c4rby an identical factor. The steady-state value of v(t),\nwhich we call v\u221e, can be derived from equation 7.19 as steady state v\u221e\nv\u221e=Nv/summationdisplay\n\u03bd=1(e\u03bd\u00b7h)\n1\u2212\u03bb\u03bde\u03bd. (7.23)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.4 Recurrent Networks 19\nThis steady-state response can also arise from a purely feedforward\nscheme if the feedforward weight matrix is chosen appropriately, as weinvite the reader to verify as an exercise.\nWe have considered ampli \ufb01cation when 0\n<\u03bb 1<1. The linear network\nbecomes unstable if \u03bb1>1. The case \u03bb\u03bd=1 is special and will be discussed\nin a later section.\nSelective Ampli \ufb01cation\nSuppose that one of the eigenvalues of a recurrent weight matrix, denoted\nby\u03bb1, is very close to one, and all the others are signi \ufb01cantly smaller than\n1. In this case, the denominator of the \u03bd=1 term on the right side of equa-\ntion 7.23 is near zero, and, unless e1\u00b7his extremely small, this single term\nwill dominate the sum. As a result, we can write\nv\u221e\u2248(e1\u00b7h)e1\n1\u2212\u03bb1. (7.24)\nSuch a network performs selective ampli \ufb01cation. The response is domi-\nnated by the projection of the input vector along the axis de \ufb01ned by e1,\nand the amplitude of the response is ampli \ufb01ed by the factor 1 /(1\u2212\u03bb1),\nwhich may be quite large if \u03bb1is near one. The steady-state response of\nsuch a network, which is proportional to e1, therefore encodes an ampli-\n\ufb01ed projection of the input vector onto e1.\nFurther information can be encoded if more eigenvalues are close to one.\nSuppose, for example, that two eigenvectors, e1and e2have the same\neigenvalue, \u03bb1=\u03bb2, close to but less than one. Then, equation 7.24 is re-\nplaced by\nv\u221e\u2248(e1\u00b7h)e1+(e2\u00b7h)e2\n1\u2212\u03bb1(7.25)\nwhich shows that the network now ampli \ufb01es and encodes the projection\nof the input vector onto the plane de \ufb01ned by e1and e2. In this case, the ac-\ntivity pattern of the network is not simply scaled when the input changes.Instead, changes in the input shift both the magnitude and pattern of net-work activity. Eigenvectors that share the same eigenvalue are termeddegenerate, and degeneracy is often the result of a symmetry. In the ex-amples considered in this chapter, degeneracy arises from invariance toshifts of the parameter\n\u03b8by a constant amount. Degeneracy is not limited\nto just two eigenvectors. A recurrent network with ndegenerate eigenval-\nues near one can amplify and encode a projection of the input vector fromtheN-dimensional space in which it is de \ufb01ned onto the n-dimensional\nsubspace spanned by the degenerate eigenvectors.\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Network Models\nInput Integration\nIf the recurrent weight matrix has an eigenvalue exactly equal to one, \u03bb1=\n1, and all the other eigenvalues satisfy \u03bb\u03bd<1, a linear recurrent network\ncan act as an integrator of its input. In this case, c1satis\ufb01es the equation\n\u03c4rdc1\ndt=e1\u00b7h (7.26)\nobtained by setting \u03bb1=1 in equation 7.44. For arbitrary time-dependent\ninputs, the solution of this equation is\nc1(t)=c1(0)+1\n\u03c4r/integraldisplayt\n0dt/primee1\u00b7h(t/prime). (7.27)\nIfh(t)is constant, c1(t)grows linearly with t. This explains why equation\n7.24 diverges as \u03bb1\u21921. Suppose, instead, that h(t)is nonzero for a while,\nand then is set to zero for an extended period of time. When h=0, equa-\ntion 7.22 shows that c\u03bd\u21920 for all \u03bd/negationslash=1, because for these eigenvectors\n\u03bb\u03bd<1. Assuming that c1(0)=0, this means that, after such a period, the\n\ufb01ring-rate vector is given, from equation 7.27 and 7.19, by network\nintegration\nv(t)\u2248e1\n\u03c4r/integraldisplayt\n0dt/primee1\u00b7h(t/prime). (7.28)\nThis shows that the network activity provides a measure of the running\nintegral of the projection of the input vector onto e1. One consequence of\nthis is that the activity of the network does not cease if h=0, provided that\nthe integral up to that point in time is nonzero. The network thus exhibitssustained activity in the absence of input, which provides a memory of theintegral of prior input.\nNetworks in the brain stem of vertebrates responsible for maintaining eye\nposition appear to act as integrators, and networks similar to the one wehave been discussing have been suggested as models of this system. Asoutlined in \ufb01gure 7.7, eye position changes in response to bursts of ac-\ntivity in ocular motor neurons located in the brain stem. Neurons in themedial vestibular nucleus and prepositus hypoglossi appear to integratethese motor signals to provide a persistent memory of eye position. Thesustained \ufb01ring rates of these neurons are approximately proportional to\nthe angular orientation of the eyes in the horizontal direction, and activ-ity persists at an approximately constant rate when the eyes are held \ufb01xed\n(bottom trace in \ufb01gure 7.7).\nThe ability of a linear recurrent network to integrate and display persistent\nactivity relies on one of the eigenvalues of the recurrent weight matrix be-ing exactly one. Any deviation from this value will cause the persistentactivity to change over time. Eye position does indeed drift, but matchingthe performance of the ocular positioning system requires \ufb01ne tuning of\nthe eigenvalue to a value extremely close to one. Including nonlinear in-teractions does not alleviate the need for a precisely tuned weight matrix.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The upper trace represents horizontal eye position during two saccadiceye movements. Motion of the eye is driven by burst neurons that move the eyesin opposite directions (second and third traces from top). The steady-state \ufb01ring\nrate (labeled persistent activity) of the integrator neuron is proportional to the timeintegral of the burst rates, integrated positively for the ON-direction burst neuronand negatively for the OFF-direction burst neuron, and thus provides a memorytrace of the maintained eye position. (Adapted from Seung et al., 2000.)\nSynaptic modi \ufb01cation rules can be used to establish the necessary synaptic\nweights, but it is not clear how such precise tuning is accomplished in thebiological system.\nContinuous Linear Recurrent Networks\nFor a linear recurrent network with continuous labeling, the equation for\nthe\ufb01ring rate\nv(\u03b8) of a neuron with preferred stimulus angle \u03b8is a linear\nversion of equation 7.14,\n\u03c4rdv(\u03b8)\ndt=\u2212v(\u03b8)+h(\u03b8)+\u03c1\u03b8/integraldisplay\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0d\u03b8/primeM(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8/prime)v(\u03b8/prime) (7.29)\nwhere h(\u03b8)is the feedforward input to a neuron with preferred stimulus\nangle \u03b8, and we have assumed a constant density \u03c1\u03b8. Because \u03b8is an angle,\nh,M, andvmust all be periodic functions with period 2 \u03c0. By making Ma\nfunction of \u03b8\u2212\u03b8/prime, we are imposing a symmetry with respect to translations\nor shifts of the angle variables on the network. In addition, we assumethat Mis an even function, M\n(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8/prime)=M(\u03b8/prime\u2212\u03b8). This is the analog, in a\ncontinuously labeled model, of a symmetric synaptic weight matrix.\nEquation 7.29 can be solved by methods similar to those used for discrete\nnetworks.

The Fourier ampli-tude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the cosine and sineFourier integrals. No particular\n\u00b5value is overwhelmingly dominant.

The network model\nshown in \ufb01gure 7.8 has \u03bb1=0.9, so that 1 /(1\u2212\u03bb1)=10. Input ampli \ufb01-\ncation can be quanti \ufb01ed by comparing the Fourier amplitude of v\u221e, for a\ngiven \u00b5value, with the analogous amplitude for the input h. According\nto equation 7.32, the ratio of these quantities is 1 /(1\u2212\u03bb\u00b5), so, in this case,\nthe\u00b5=1 amplitude should be ampli \ufb01ed by a factor of ten while all other\namplitudes are unampli \ufb01ed.

The most signi \ufb01cant problem is that the\n\ufb01ring rates in a linear network can take negative values.

In this\nsection, we show some examples illustrating the effect of including such arectifying nonlinearity. Some of the features of linear recurrent networksremain when recti \ufb01cation is included, but several new features also ap-\npear.\nIn the examples given below, we consider a continuous model, similar to\nthat of equation 7.29, with recurrent couplings given by equation 7.33, but\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n24 Network Models\n-50\n-180 -90 0 90 180020406080\n-180 -90 0 90 180\n   0   1    2   3    4   5    6   7   8    9    0   1    2   3    4   5    6   7   8    9   00.20.40.60.81\u03b8 (deg) \u03b8 (deg)v (Hz)\n\u00b5\u00b5A B\nC D\n   00.020.040.060.080.15Fourier amplitude\nFourier amplitudeh (Hz)\nFigure 7.9: Selective ampli \ufb01cation in a recurrent network with recti \ufb01cation.

Once again, a noisy input ( \ufb01gure 7.9A)\ngenerates a much smoother output response pro \ufb01le (\ufb01gure 7.9B). The out-\nput response of the recti \ufb01ed network corresponds roughly to the positive\npart of the sinusoidal response pro \ufb01le of the linear network ( \ufb01gure 7.8B).\nThe negative output has been eliminated by the recti \ufb01cation. Because\nfewer neurons in the network have nonzero responses than in the linearcase, the value of the parameter\n\u03bb1in equation 7.33 has been increased to\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.4 Recurrent Networks 25\n1.9. This value, being larger than one, would lead to an unstable network\nin the linear case. While nonlinear networks can also be unstable, the re-striction to eigenvalues less than one is no longer the relevant condition.\nIn a nonlinear network, the Fourier analysis of the input and output re-\nsponses is no longer as informative as it is for a linear network. Due tothe recti \ufb01cation, the\n\u03bd=0,1, and 2 Fourier components are all ampli \ufb01ed\n(\ufb01gure 7.9D) compared to their input values ( \ufb01gure 7.9C). Nevertheless,\nexcept for recti \ufb01cation, the nonlinear recurrent network ampli \ufb01es the in-\nput signal selectively in a similar manner as the linear network.\nA Recurrent Model of Simple Cells in Primary Visual Cortex\nIn chapter 2, we discussed a feedforward model in which the elongated\nreceptive \ufb01elds of simple cells in primary visual cortex were formed by\nsumming the inputs from lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons with their re-ceptive \ufb01elds arranged in alternating rows of ON and OFF cells. While this\nmodel quite successfully accounts for a number of features of simple cells,such as orientation tuning, it is dif \ufb01cult to reconcile with the anatomy and\ncircuitry of the cerebral cortex. By far the majority of the synapses ontoany cortical neuron arise from other cortical neurons, not from thalamicafferents. Therefore, feedforward models account for the response prop-erties of cortical neurons while ignoring the inputs that are numericallymost prominent. The large number of intracortical connections suggests,instead, that recurrent circuitry might play an important role in shapingthe responses of neurons in primary visual cortex.\nBen-Yishai, Bar-Or, and Sompolinsky (1995) developed a model at the\nother extreme, for which recurrent connections are the primary determin-ers of orientation tuning. The model is similar in structure to the modelof equations 7.35 and 7.33, except that it includes a global inhibitory inter-action. In addition, because orientation angles are de \ufb01ned over the range\nfrom\n\u2212\u03c0/2t o\u03c0/2, rather than over the full 2 \u03c0range, the cosine functions\nin the model have extra factors of 2 in them. The basic equation of themodel, as we implement it, is\n\u03c4rdv(\u03b8)\ndt=\u2212v(\u03b8)+/bracketleftBigg\nh(\u03b8)+/integraldisplay\u03c0/2\n\u2212\u03c0/2d\u03b8/prime\n\u03c0/parenleftbig\u2212\u03bb0+\u03bb1cos(2(\u03b8\u2212\u03b8/prime))/parenrightbigv(\u03b8/prime)/bracketrightBigg\n+\n(7.36)\nwhere v(\u03b8) is the \ufb01ring rate of a neuron with preferred orientation \u03b8.\nThe input to the model represents the orientation-tuned feedforward in-\nput arising from ON-center and OFF-center LGN cells responding to anoriented image. As a function of preferred orientation, the input for animage with orientation angle\n/Theta1=0i s\nh(\u03b8)=Ac(1\u2212/epsilon1+/epsilon1cos(2\u03b8)) (7.37)\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Network Models\nwhere Asets the overall amplitude and cis equal to the image contrast.\nThe factor /epsilon1controls how strongly the input is modulated by the orien-\ntation angle. For /epsilon1=0, all neurons receive the same input, while /epsilon1=0.5\nproduces the maximum modulation consistent with a positive input. Westudy this model in the case when\n/epsilon1is small, which means that the input\nis only weakly tuned for orientation and any strong orientation selectivitymust arise through recurrent interactions.\nTo study orientation selectivity, we want to examine the tuning curves of\nindividual neurons in response to stimuli with different orientation an-gles\n/Theta1. The plots of network responses that we have been using show the\n\ufb01ring rates v(\u03b8) of all the neurons in the network as a function of their\npreferred stimulus angles \u03b8when the input stimulus has a \ufb01xed value,\ntypically /Theta1=0. As a consequence of the translation invariance of the net-\nwork model, the response for other values of /Theta1can be obtained simply by\nshifting this curve so that it plots v(\u03b8\u2212/Theta1). Furthermore, except for the\nasymmetric effects of noise on the input, v(\u03b8\u2212/Theta1)is a symmetric function.\nThese features follow from the fact that the network we are studying isinvariant with respect to translations and sign changes of the angle vari-ables that characterize the stimulus and response selectivities. An impor-tant consequence of this result is that the curve\nv(\u03b8), showing the response\nof the entire population, can also be interpreted as the tuning curve of asingle neuron. If the response of the population to a stimulus angle\n/Theta1is\nv(\u03b8\u2212/Theta1), the response of a single neuron with preferred angle \u03b8=0i s\nv(\u2212/Theta1)=v(/Theta1) from the symmetry of v. Because v(/Theta1) is the tuning curve\nof a single neuron with \u03b8=0 to a stimulus angle /Theta1, the plots we show of\nv(\u03b8) can be interpreted in a dual way, as both population responses and\nindividual neuronal tuning curves.\nFigure 7.10A shows the feedforward input to the model network for four\ndifferent levels of contrast. Because the parameter /epsilon1was chosen to be 0.1,\nthe modulation of the input as a function of orientation angle is small.Due to network ampli \ufb01cation, the response of the network is much more\nstrongly tuned to orientation ( \ufb01gure 7.10B). This is the result of the selec-\ntive ampli \ufb01cation of the tuned part of the input by the recurrent network.\nThe modulation and overall height of the input curve in \ufb01gure 7.10A in-\ncrease linearly with contrast. The response shown in \ufb01gure 7.10B, inter-\npreted as a tuning curve, increases in amplitude for higher contrast, butdoes not broaden. This can be seen by noting that all four curves in \ufb01gure\n7.10B go to zero at the same two points. This effect, which occurs becausethe shape and width of the response tuning curve are determined primar-ily by the recurrent interactions within the network, is a feature of orien-tation curves of real simple cells, as seen in \ufb01gure 7.10C. The width of the\ntuning curve can be reduced by including a positive threshold in the re-sponse function of equation 7.34, or by changing the amount of inhibition,but it stays roughly constant as a function of stimulus strength.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

If the pattern of network connec-\ntivity ampli \ufb01es nonselective rather than selective responses, recurrent in-\nteractions can also decrease selectivity. Recall from chapter 2 that neuronsin the primary visual cortex are classi \ufb01ed as simple or complex depend-\ning on their sensitivity to the spatial phase of a grating stimulus. Simplecells respond maximally when the spatial positioning of the light and darkregions of a grating matches the locations of the ON and OFF regions oftheir receptive \ufb01elds. Complex cells do not have distinct ON and OFF re-\ngions in their receptive \ufb01elds and respond to gratings of the appropriate\norientation and spatial frequency relatively independently of where theirlight and dark stripes fall. In other words, complex cells are insensitive tospatial phase.\nChance, Nelson, and Abbott (1999) showed that complex cell responses\ncould be generated from simple cell responses by a recurrent network. Asin chapter 2, we label spatial phase preferences by the angle\n\u03c6. The feed-\nforward input h(\u03c6)in the model is set equal to the recti \ufb01ed response of\na simple cell with preferred spatial phase \u03c6(\ufb01gure 7.11A). Each neuron\nin the network is labeled by the spatial phase preference of its feedfor-ward input. The network neurons also receive recurrent input given bythe weight function M\n(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6/prime)=\u03bb1/(2\u03c0\u03c1\u03c6)that is the same for all con-\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Network Models\nnected neuron pairs.

A) The input to the network as\na function of spatial phase preference. The input h(\u03c6)is equivalent to that of a\nsimple cell with spatial phase preference \u03c6responding to a grating of zero spatial\nphase. B) Network response, which can also be interpreted as the spatial phasetuning curve of a network neuron. The network was given by equation 7.38 with\n\u03bb1=0.95. (Adapted from Chance et al., 1999.)\nIn the absence of recurrent connections ( \u03bb1=0), the response of a neuron\nlabeled by \u03c6isv(\u03c6)=h(\u03c6), which is equal to the response of a simple\ncell with preferred spatial phase \u03c6. However, for \u03bb1suf\ufb01ciently close to\none, the recurrent model produces responses that resemble those of com-plex cells. Figure 7.11B shows the population response, or equivalently thesingle-cell response tuning curve, of the model in response to the tuned in-put shown in Figure 7.11A. The input, being the response of a simple cell,shows strong tuning for spatial phase. The output tuning curve, however,is almost constant as a function of spatial phase, like that of a complexcell. The spatial-phase insensitivity of the network response is due to thefact that the network ampli \ufb01es the component of the input that is inde-\npendent of spatial phase, because the eigenfunction of Mwith the largest\neigenvalue is spatial-phase invariant. This changes simple cell inputs intocomplex cell outputs.\nWinner-Take-All Input Selection\nFor a linear network, the response to two superimposed inputs is simply\nthe sum of the responses to each input separately. Figure 7.12 shows oneway in which a rectifying nonlinearity modi \ufb01es this superposition prop-\nerty. In this case, the input to the recurrent network consists of activitycentered around two preferred stimulus angles,\n\u00b190\u25e6. The output of the\nnonlinear network shown in \ufb01gure 7.12B is not of this form, but instead\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

This occurs because the nonlinear recurrent net-\nwork supports the stereotyped unimodal activity pattern seen in \ufb01gure\n7.12B, so a multimodal input tends to generate a unimodal output. Theheight of the input peak has a large effect in determining where the singlepeak of the network output is located, but it is not the only feature thatdetermines the response. For example, the network output can favor abroader, lower peak over a narrower, higher one.\nGain Modulation\nA nonlinear recurrent network can generate an output that resembles the\ngain-modulated responses of posterior parietal neurons shown in \ufb01gure\n7.6, as noted by Salinas and Abbott (1996). To obtain this result, we in-terpret the angle\n\u03b8as a preferred direction in the visual \ufb01eld in retinal\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n30 Network Models\ncoordinates (the variable we called searlier in the chapter). The signal cor-\nresponding to gaze direction (what we called gbefore) is represented as a\nconstant input to all neurons irrespective of their preferred stimulus angle.Figure 7.13 shows the effect of adding such a constant term to the input ofthe nonlinear network. The input shown in \ufb01gure 7.13A corresponds to\na visual target located at a retinal position of 0\n\u25e6. The different lines show\ndifferent values of the constant input, representing three different gaze di-rections. The responses shown in \ufb01gure 7.13B all have localized activity\ncentered around\n\u03b8=0\u25e6, indicating that the individual neurons have \ufb01xed\ntuning curves expressed in retinal coordinates. The effect of the constantinput, representing gaze direction, is to scale up or gain modulate thesetuning curves, producing a result similar to that shown in \ufb01gure 7.6. The\nadditive constant in the input shown in \ufb01gure 7.13A has a multiplicative\neffect on the output activity shown in 7.13B. This is primarily due to thefact that the width of the activity pro \ufb01les is \ufb01xed by the recurrent network\ninteraction, so a constant positive input raises (and a negative input low-ers) the peak of the response curve without broadening the base of thecurve.\nSustained Activity\nThe effects illustrated in \ufb01gures 7.12 and 7.13 arise because the nonlinear\nrecurrent network has a stereotyped pattern of activity that is largely de-termined by interactions with other neurons in the network rather thanby the feedforward input. If the recurrent connections are strong enough,the pattern of population activity, once established, can become indepen-dent of the structure of the input. For example, the recurrent network wehave been studying can support a pattern of activity localized around agiven preferred stimulus value, even when the input is uniform. This isseen in \ufb01gure 7.14. The neurons of the network initially receive inputs that\ndepend on their preferred angles, as seen in \ufb01gure 7.14A. This produces\na localized pattern of network activity ( \ufb01gure 7.14B). When the input is\nswitched to the same constant value for all neurons ( \ufb01gure 7.14C), the net-\nwork activity does not become uniform. Instead, it stays localized aroundthe value\n\u03b8=0(\ufb01gure 7.14D). This means that constant input can main-\ntain a state that provides a memory of previous localized input activity.Networks similar to this have been proposed as models of sustained activ-ity in the head-direction system of the rat and in prefrontal cortex duringtasks involving working memory.\nThis memory mechanism is related to the integration seen in the linear\nmodel of eye position maintenance discussed previously. The linear net-work has an eigenvector e\n1with eigenvalue \u03bb1=1. This allows v=c1e1to\nbe a static solution of the equations of the network (7.17) in the absenceof input for any value of c\n1. As a result, the network can preserve any\ninitial value of c1as a memory. In the case of \ufb01gure 7.14, the steady-state\nactivity in the absence of tuned input is a function of \u03b8\u2212/Theta1, for any value\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The model is the same as that used in \ufb01gures 7.9, 7.12,\nand 7.13.\nof the angle /Theta1. As a result, the network can preserve any initial value of\n/Theta1as a memory ( /Theta1=0\u25e6in the \ufb01gure). The activities of the units v(\u03b8) de-\npend on /Theta1in an essentially nonlinear manner, but, if we consider linear\nperturbations around this nonlinear solution, there is an eigenvector witheigenvalue\n\u03bb1=1 associated with shifts in the value of /Theta1. In this case,\nit can be shown that \u03bb1=1 because the network was constructed to be\ntranslationally invariant.\nMaximum Likelihood and Network Recoding\nRecurrent networks can generate characteristic patterns of activity even\nwhen they receive complex inputs ( \ufb01gure 7.9) and can maintain these pat-\nterns while receiving constant input ( \ufb01gure 7.14). Pouget, Zhang, Deneve\nand Latham (1998) suggested that the location of the characteristic pat-tern (i.e. the value of\n/Theta1associated with the peak of the population activity\npro\ufb01le) could be interpreted as a match of a \ufb01xed template curve to the\ninput activity pro \ufb01le. This curve \ufb01tting operation is at the heart of the\nmaximum likelihood decoding method we described in chapter 3 for esti-mating a stimulus variable such as\n/Theta1. In the maximum likelihood method,\nthe\ufb01tting curve is determined by the tuning functions of the neurons, and\nthe curve \ufb01tting procedure is de \ufb01ned by the characteristics of the noise\nperturbing the input activities. If the properties of the recurrent networkmatch these optimal characteristics, the network can approximate maxi-mum likelihood decoding. Once the activity of the population of neurons\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n32 Network Models\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0h (Hz)\n-90-4504590\n\u03b8 (deg)70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0v (Hz)\n-90-4504590\n\u03b8 (deg)A B\nFigure 7.15: Recoding by a network model.

The net-\nwork model was similar to that used in \ufb01gure 7.9 except that the recurrent synap-\ntic weights were in the form of a Gabor-like function rather than a cosine, and therecurrent connections had short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. (seePouget et al., 1998.)\nhas stabilized to its sterotyped shape, a simple decoding method such as\nvector decoding can be applied to extract the estimated value of /Theta1. This\nallows the accuracy of a vector decoding method to approach that of morecomplex optimal methods, because the computational work of curve \ufb01t-\nting has been performed by the nonlinear recurrent interactions.\nFigure 7.15 shows how this idea works in a network of 64 neurons re-\nceiving inputs that have Gaussian (rather than cosine) tuning curves as afunction of\n/Theta1. Vector decoding applied to the reconstruction of /Theta1from the\nactivity of the network or its inputs turns out to be almost unbiased. Theway to judge decoding accuracy is therefore to compute the standard devi-ation of the decoded\n/Theta1values (chapter 3).

Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.4 Recurrent Networks 33\nNetwork Stability\nWhen a network responds to a constant input by relaxing to a steady state\nwith dv/dt=000, it is said to exhibit \ufb01xed-point behavior. Almost all the net- \ufb01xed-point behavior\nwork activity we have discussed thus far involves such \ufb01xed points. This\nis by no means the only type of long-term activity that a network modelcan display. In a later section of this chapter, we discuss networks that os-cillate, and chaotic behavior is also possible. But if certain conditions aremet, a network will inevitably reach a \ufb01xed point in response to constant\ninput. The theory of Lyapunov functions, to which we give an informalintroduction, can be used to prove when this occurs.\nIt is easier to discuss the Lyapunov function for a network if we use the\n\ufb01ring-rate dynamics of equation 7.6 rather than equation 7.8. For a net-\nwork model, this means expressing the vector of network \ufb01ring rates as\nv\n=F(I), where Iis the total synaptic current vector, i.e. Iarepresents the\ntotal synaptic current for unit a.Iobeys the dynamic equation derived\nfrom generalizing equation 7.6 to a network situation, recurrent model\nwith current\ndynamics \u03c4sdI\ndt=\u2212I+h+M\u00b7F(I). (7.39)\nNote that we have made the substitution v=F(I)in the last term of the\nright side of this equation. Equation 7.39 is sometimes used instead ofequation 7.11 as the dynamical equation governing recurrent \ufb01ring-rate\nmodel networks. For this form of \ufb01ring-rate model with a symmetric re-\ncurrent weight matrix satisfying M\naa=0 for all a, Cohen and Grossberg\n(1983) showed that the function Lyapunov\nfunction L\nL(I)=Nv/summationdisplay\na=1/parenleftBigg/integraldisplayIa\n0dzazaF/prime(za)\u2212haF(Ia)\u22121\n2Nv/summationdisplay\na/prime=1F(Ia)Maa/primeF(Ia/prime)/parenrightBigg\n(7.40)\nhasdL/dt<0 whenever dI/dt/negationslash=000.

(7.41)\nBecause F/prime>0,Ldecreases unless dI/dt=000. If Lis bounded from below,\nit cannot decrease inde \ufb01nitely, so I=h+M\u00b7vmust converge to a \ufb01xed\npoint. This implies that vmust converge to a \ufb01xed point as well.\nWe have required that F/prime(I)>0 for all values of its argument I. However,\nwith some technical complications, it can be shown that the Lyapunovfunction we have presented also applied to the case of the rectifying ac-tivation function F\n(I)=[I]+, even though it is not differentiable at I=0\nand F/prime(I)=0f o r I<0. Convergence to a \ufb01x e dp o i n t ,o ro n eo fas e to f\n\ufb01xed points, requires the Lyapunov function to be bounded from below.\nOne way to ensure this is to use a saturating activation function F, so that\nF(I)is bounded as I\u2192\u221e . Another way is to keep the eigenvalues of M\nsuf\ufb01ciently small.\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Network Models\nAssociative Memory\nIn an associative memory, a partial or approximate representation of a\nstored item is used to recall the full item. Unlike a standard random ac-cess memory, recall in an associative memory is based on content ratherthan on an address. For this reason, associative memory is also knownas content-addressable memory. An example would be recalling everydigit of a known phone number given a few of its digits as an initialclue. Associative memory networks have been suggested as models ofvarious parts of the mammalian brain in which there is substantial recur-rent feedback. These include area CA3 of the hippocampus and parts ofthe prefrontal cortex, structures which have long been implicated in var-ious forms of memory. A number of network models exhibit associativememory, the best known being the so-called Hop \ufb01eld networks (Hop \ufb01eld,\n1982 & 1984).\nThe models of memory we discussed previously in this chapter store infor-\nmation by means of persistent activity, with a particular item representedby the position of a stereotyped population activity pro \ufb01le. The idea un-\nderlying an associative (more strictly, auto-associative) memory is to ex-tend persistent activity to a broader set of different population pro \ufb01les,\nwhich are called memory patterns. Each of these is a \ufb01xed point of the\ndynamics of the network. The memory patterns are determined by andstored within the recurrent synaptic weights of the network, so memoryretention does not require persistent activity. Rather, persistent activity isused to signal memory recall and to retain the identity of the most recentlyretrieved item.\nDuring recall, an associative memory performs the computational oper-\nation of pattern matching, \ufb01nding the memory pattern that most closely\nmatches a distorted or partial activity pattern. This is achieved by initial-izing the network with an activity pro \ufb01le similar (but not identical) to one\nof the memory patterns, letting it relax to a \ufb01xed point, and treating the\nnetwork activity at the \ufb01xed point as the best matching pattern. This is\nexactly the analog of the way that the recurrent model of maximum like-lihood decoding executes a curve \ufb01tting procedure. Each memory pattern\nhas a basin of attraction, de \ufb01ned as the set of initial states for which the\nnetwork relaxes to that \ufb01xed point. The structure of these basins of attrac-\ntion de \ufb01nes the matching properties of the network. The network dynam-\nics is governed by a Lyapunov function of the form described above, andtherefore the network will always relax to a \ufb01xed point. Provided that not\ntoo many memories are stored, the \ufb01xed points will closely resemble the\nstored memory patterns.\nThe associative network satis \ufb01es the dynamic equation 7.11, with the sat-\nurating activation function\nF\n(Is)=150 Hz/bracketleftbigg\ntanh/parenleftbiggIs\u2212\u03b3\n150 Hz/parenrightbigg/bracketrightbigg\n+(7.42)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.4 Recurrent Networks 35\nchosen to ensure that the Lyapunov function 7.40 is bounded from below.\nThis is similar to a half-wave recti \ufb01ed activation function with threshold\n\u03b3, except that it saturates at a \ufb01ring rate of 150 Hz, which is outside the\nnormal operating range of the units. We use a negative threshold, \u03b3=\n\u221220 Hz, which corresponds to a constant source of excitation rather than\na conventional threshold and generates background activity.\nWhen this model is used for memory storage, a number of patterns, de-\nnoted by vmwith m=1,2,..., Nmem, are stored. Associative recall is\nachieved by starting the network in an initial state that is almost, but notexactly, proportional to one of the memory patterns, v\n(0)\u2248cvmfor some\nvalue of mand constant c. In this case, approximately proportional means\nthat a signi \ufb01cant number, but not all, of the elements of v(0)are close to\nthe corresponding elements of cvm. The network then evolves according\nto equation 7.11 (with h=000). If the recall is successful, the dynamics con-\nverge to a \ufb01xed point proportional to the memory pattern associated with\nthe initial state, that is v(t)\u2192c/primevmfor large t, where c/primeis another constant.\nFailure of recall occurs if the \ufb01xed point reached by the network is not\nproportional to the memory state vm.\nIn the example we consider, the components of the patterns to be stored are\nset to either 0 or 1. The assignment of these two values to the componentsof a given v\nmis usually random with the probability of assigning a 1 equal\nto\u03b1and of assigning a 0 equal to 1 \u2212\u03b1. However, in the example we show,\ntwo of the patterns have been assigned non-randomly to make them easierto detect in the \ufb01gures. The parameter\n\u03b1is known as the sparseness of the memory\nsparseness \u03b1 memory patterns. The sparser the patterns, the more can be stored, but theless information each contains. We are interested in the limit of large N\nv,\nin which case the maximum number of patterns that can be stored, Nmem, number of\nmemories N mem is proportional to Nv.\nThe key to successful recall is in the choice of the matrix M, which is given\nby\nM=1.25\n(1\u2212\u03b1)\u03b1NvNmem/summationdisplay\nm=1(vm\u2212\u03b1n)(vm\u2212\u03b1n)\u22121\n\u03b1Nvnn. (7.43)\nHere nis de\ufb01ned as a vector that has each of its Nvcomponents equal vector of ones n\nto one. This form of coupling is called a covariance rule, because the \ufb01rstcovariance rule\nterm on the right side is proportional to the covariance matrix of the collec-\ntion of patterns. In chapter 8, we study synaptic plasticity rules that leadto this term. The second term introduces inhibition between the units.\nFigure 7.16 shows an example of a network of N\nv=50 units exhibiting\nassociative memory. This network stores 4 patterns with \u03b1=0.25. Re-\ncall of two of these patterns is shown in \ufb01gure 7.16B and 7.16C. From an\ninitial activity pattern only vaguely resembling one of the stored patterns,the network is able to attain a \ufb01xed activity pattern approximately propor-\ntional to the best matching memory pattern. Similar results would apply\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n36 Network Models\n20\n51015vE (Hz)\nt (ms)50 15020\n51015vE (Hz)\n150 50 150 50\nt (ms) t (ms)cell\ncellAB C\nFigure 7.16: Associative recall of memory patterns in a network model.

The initial state of the network was random but with a biastoward this particular pattern. The \ufb01nal state is similar to the memory pattern. C)\nRecall of another of the stored memory patterns. The stored pattern had nonzerovalues only for every fourth cell. The initial state of the network was again randombut biased toward this pattern. The \ufb01nal state is similar to the memory pattern.\nfor the other two memory patterns stored by the network, but it would be\nmore dif \ufb01cult to see these patterns in the \ufb01gure because they are random.\nThe rationale behind the weight matrix comes from considering the effect\nof the recurrent interactions if the activities match one of the memories,v\n=c/primev1for example. A network activity pattern v=c/primev1can only be a\n\ufb01xed point if\nc/primev1=F(c/primeM\u00b7v1), (7.44)\nwhich ensures that the right side of equation 7.11 (with h=000) vanishes.\nWe assume that \u03b1Nvcomponents of v1are equal to one and the remaining\n(1\u2212\u03b1)Nvare zero.

(7.47)\nThe inequality follows from the requirement that the total synaptic current\nplus the threshold is less than zero so that F(Is)=0 for these components.\nOn the other hand, the \ufb01rst equation requires that (0.25\u22121.25\u03b1)c/prime\u2212\u03b3>\n0 so that F>0 for the nonzero components of v1.I f/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1can be ignored\nand these two conditions are satis \ufb01ed,v=c/primev1will be a \ufb01xed point of the\nnetwork dynamics.\nThe term /epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1in equation 7.45, which we have been ignoring, is only negligi-\nble if Nmem/lessmuchNv.I fNmem\u2248N,/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1can become large enough to destabilize\nthe memory states as \ufb01xed points. This limits the number of memories that\ncan be stored in the network. Detailed analysis of the maximum value of\nNmem is complicated by correlations among the terms that contribute to\n/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1, but rigorous evaluations can be made of the capacity of the network,\nboth for binary stored patterns (as here), and for real-valued patterns forwhich the activities of each element are drawn from a probability distri-bution. Different network architectures can also be considered, includingones with very sparse connectivity between units.\nThe basic conclusions from studies of associative memory models with\nthreshold linear or saturating units is that large networks can store evenlarger numbers of patterns, particularly if the patterns are sparse (\n\u03b1is near\n0) and if a few errors in recall can be tolerated. Nevertheless, the informa-tion stored per synapse is typically quite small. However, the simple co-variance prescription for the weights in equation 7.43 is far from optimal.More sophisticated methods (such as the delta rule discussed in chapter 8)can achieve signi \ufb01cantly higher storage densities.\n7.5 Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks\nIn this section, we discuss models in which excitatory and inhibitory neu-\nrons are described separately by equations 7.12 and 7.13. These modelsexhibit richer dynamics than the single population models with symmet-ric coupling matrices we have analyzed up to this point. In models withexcitatory and inhibitory sub-populations, the full synaptic weight matrix\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n38 Network Models\nis not symmetric, and network oscillations can arise. We begin by analyz-\ning a model of homogeneous coupled excitatory and inhibitory popula-tions. We introduce methods for determining whether this model exhibitsconstant or oscillatory activity. We then present two network models inwhich oscillations appear. The \ufb01rst is a model of the olfactory bulb, and\nthe second displays selective ampli \ufb01cation in an oscillatory mode.\nHomogeneous Excitatory and Inhibitory Populations\nAs an illustration of the dynamics of excitatory-inhibitory network mod-\nels, we analyze a simple model in which all of the excitatory neurons aredescribed by a single \ufb01ring rate\nvE, and all of the inhibitory neurons are\ndescribed by a second rate vI. Although we think of this example as a\nmodel of interacting neuronal populations, it is constructed as if it con-sists of just two neurons. Equations 7.12 and 7.13 with threshold linearresponse functions are used to describe the two \ufb01ring rates, so that\n\u03c4EdvE\ndt=\u2212vE+[MEEvE+MEIvI\u2212\u03b3E]+ (7.48)\nand\n\u03c4IdvI\ndt=\u2212vI+[MIIvI+MIEvE\u2212\u03b3I]+. (7.49)\nThe synaptic weights MEE,MIE,MEI, and MIIare numbers rather than\nmatrices in this model. In the example we consider, we set MEE=1.25,\nMIE=1,MII=0,MEI=\u2212 1,\u03b3E=\u2212 10 Hz, \u03b3I=10 Hz, \u03c4E=10 ms, and\nwe vary the value of \u03c4I. The negative value of \u03b3Emeans that this param-\neter serves as a source of constant background activity rather than as athreshold.\nPhase-Plane Methods and Stability Analysis\nThe model of interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations given by\nequations 7.48 and 7.49 provides an opportunity for us to illustrate someof the techniques used to study the dynamics of nonlinear systems. Thismodel exhibits both static (constant\nvEandvI) and oscillatory activity de-\npending on the values of its parameters. Stability analysis can be usedto determine the parameter values where transitions between these twotypes of activity take place.\nThe\ufb01ring rates\nvE(t)andvI(t)arising from equations 7.48 and 7.49 can\nbe displayed by plotting them as functions of time, as in \ufb01gures 7.18A\nand 7.19A. Another useful way of depicting these results, illustrated in\ufb01gures 7.18B and 7.19B, is to plot pairs of points\n(vE(t),v I(t))for a range\noftvalues. As the \ufb01ring rates change, these points trace out a curve or\ntrajectory in the vE-vIplane, which is called the phase plane of the model. phase plane\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The recti \ufb01cation nonlinearity prevents the spiral\ntrajectory from expanding past zero and thereby stabilizes the limit cycle.\nThere are a number of ways that a nonlinear system can make a transi-\ntion from a stable \ufb01xed point to a limit cycle. Such transitions are called\nbifurcations. The transition seen between \ufb01gures 7.18 and 7.19 is a Hopf\nbifurcation. In this case, a \ufb01xed point becomes unstable as a parameter Hopf bifurcation\nis changed (in this case\n\u03c4I) when the real part of a complex eigenvalue\nchanges sign. In a Hopf bifurcation, the limit cycle emerges at a \ufb01nite fre-\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n42 Network Models\nquency, which is similar to the behavior of a type II neuron when it starts\n\ufb01ring action potentials, as discussed in chapter 6. Other types of bifurca-\ntions produce type I behavior with oscillations emerging at zero frequency(chapter 6). One example of this is a saddle-node bifurcation, which occurs saddle-node\nbifurcation when parameters are changed such that two \ufb01xed points, one stable and\none unstable, meet at the same point in the phase plane.\nThe Olfactory Bulb\nThe olfactory bulb, and analogous olfactory areas in insects, provide exam-ples where sensory processing involves oscillatory activity. The olfactorybulb represents the \ufb01rst stage of processing beyond the olfactory receptors\nin the vertebrate olfactory system. Olfactory receptor neurons respond toodor molecules and send their axons to the olfactory bulb. These axonsterminate in glomeruli where they synapse onto mitral and tufted cells, mitral cells\ntufted cells and also local interneurons. The mitral and tufted cells provide the out-\nput of the olfactory bulb by sending projections to the primary olfactorycortex. They also synapse onto the larger population of inhibitory granulecells. The granule cells in turn inhibit the mitral and tufted cells. granule cells\nA\nv\nhEvI\nreceptor inputsmitral\ncellsgranule\ncells\nEB\n100 ms\nFigure 7.20: A) Extracellular \ufb01eld potential recorded in the olfactory bulb during\nrespiratory waves representing three successive sniffs.

(A adapted from Freeman and Schneider, 1982; B adaptedfrom Li, 1995.)\nThe activity in the olfactory bulb of many vertebrates is strongly in \ufb02u-\nenced by a sniff cycle in which a few quick sniffs bring odors past the ol-factory receptors. Figure 7.20A shows an extracellular potential recordedduring three successive sniffs. The three large oscillations in the \ufb01gure\nare due to the sniffs. The oscillations we discuss in this section are thesmaller, higher frequency oscillations seen around the peak of each sniffcycle. These arise from oscillatory neural activity. Individual mitral cellshave quite low \ufb01ring rates, and do not \ufb01re on each cycle of the oscillations.\nThe oscillations are phase-locked across the bulb, but different odors in-duce oscillations of different amplitudes and phases.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.5 Excitatory-Inhibitory Networks 43\nLi and Hop \ufb01eld (1989) modeled the mitral and granule cells of the ol-\nfactory bulb as a nonlinear input-driven network oscillator. Figure 7.20Bshows the architecture of the model, which uses equations 7.12 and 7.13with M\nEE=MII=0. The absence of these couplings in the model is in ac-\ncord with the anatomy of the bulb. The rates vEand vIrefer to the mitral\nand granule cells, respectively ( \ufb01gure 7.20B). Figure 7.21A shows the acti-\nvation functions of the model. The time constants for the two populationsof cells are the same,\n\u03c4E=\u03c4I=6.7 ms. hEis the input from the receptors\nto the mitral cells, and hIis a constant representing top-down input that\nexists from the olfactory cortex to the granule cells.\n02468050100150200\nmitralgranuleF (Hz)\ninputAB\n0 200 4000.811.2\n0 200 400050100\nt (ms)Re{\u03bb}  (s-1)\nIm{\u03bb} /2\u03c0 (Hz)\nFigure 7.21: Activation functions and eigenvalues for the olfactory bulb model.\nA) The activation functions FE(solid curve) for the mitral cells, and FI(dashed\ncurve) for the granule cells.

These are plotted as a function of time\nduring a sniff cycle. When the real part of the eigenvalue becomes greater thanone, it determines the growth rate away from the \ufb01xed point and the imaginary\npart divided by 2\n\u03c0determines the initial frequency of the resulting oscillations.\n(Adapted from Li, 1995.)\nThe\ufb01eld potential in \ufb01gure 7.20A shows oscillations during each sniff,\nbut not between sniffs. For the model to match this pattern of activity, theinput from the olfactory receptors, h\nE, must induce a transition between\n\ufb01xed-point and oscillatory activity. Before a sniff, the network must have\na stable \ufb01xed point with low activities. As hEincreases during a sniff, this\nsteady-state con \ufb01guration must become unstable leading to oscillatory ac-\ntivity. The analysis of the stability of the \ufb01xed point and the onset of oscil-\nlations is closely related to our previous stability analysis of the model ofhomogeneous populations of coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons.It is based on properties of the eigenvalues of the linear stability matrix(see the Mathematical Appendix). In this case, the stability matrix includescontributions from the derivatives of the activation functions evaluated atthe\ufb01xed point. For the \ufb01xed point to become unstable, the real part of at\nleast one of the eigenvalues that arise in this analysis must become largerthan 1. To ensure oscillations, at least one of these destabilizing eigenval-\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n44 Network Models\nmitral cells\ngranule cells400 ms5Hz 15Hzodor 1 odor 2\nFigure 7.22: Activities of four of ten mitral (upper) and granule (lower) cells dur-\ning a single sniff cycle for two different odors.

These requirements impose\nconstraints on the connections between the mitral and granule cells andon the inputs.\nFigure 7.21B shows the real and imaginary parts of the relevant eigen-\nvalue, labeled\n\u03bb, during one sniff cycle. About 100 ms into the cycle the\nreal part of \u03bbgets bigger than 1. Reading off the imaginary part of \u03bbat\nthis point, we \ufb01nd that this sets off roughly 40 Hz oscillations in the net-\nwork. These oscillations stop about 300 ms into the sniff cycle when thereal part of\n\u03bbdrops below 1. The input hEfrom the receptors plays two\ncritical roles in this process. First, it makes the eigenvalue great than 1 bymodifying where the \ufb01xed point lies on the activation function curves in\n\ufb01gure 7.21A. Second, it affects which particular neurons are destabilized\nand thus, which begin to oscillate. The ultimate pattern of oscillatory ac-tivity is determined both by the input h\nEand by the recurrent couplings\nof the network.\nFigure 7.22 shows the behavior of the network during a single sniff cycle\nin the presence of two different odors, represented by two different valuesofh\nE. The top rows show the activity of four mitral cells, and the bottom\nrows four granule cells. The amplitudes and phases of the oscillations seenin these traces, along with the identities of the mitral cells taking part inthem, provide a signature of the identity of the odor that was presented.\nOscillatory Ampli \ufb01cation\nAs a \ufb01nal example of network oscillations, we return to ampli \ufb01cation of\ninput signals by a recurrently connected network. Two factors controlthe amount of selective ampli \ufb01cation that is viable in networks such as\nthat shown in \ufb01gure 7.9. The most important constraint on the recurrent\nweights is that the network must be stable, so the activity does not increasewithout bound. Another possible constraint is suggested by \ufb01gure 7.14D\nwhere the output shows a tuned response even though the input to the net-\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.6 Stochastic Networks 45\nwork is constant as a function of \u03b8. Tuned output in the absence of tuned\ninput can serve as a memory mechanism, but it would produce persistentperceptions if it occurs in a primary sensory area, for example. Avoidingthis in the network limits the recurrent weights and the amount of ampli-\ufb01cation that can be supported.\nLi and Dayan (1999) showed that this restriction can be signi \ufb01cantly eased\nusing the richer dynamics of networks of coupled inhibitory and excita-tory neurons. Figure 7.23 shows an example with continuous neuron la-beling based on a continuous version of equations 7.12 and 7.13. The inputis either h\nE(\u03b8)=8(1+5\n8cos(2\u03b8))in the modulated case ( \ufb01gure 7.23B) or\nhE(\u03b8)=8 in the unmodulated case ( \ufb01gure 7.23C). Noise with standard de-\nviation 0 .4 corrupts this input. The input to the network is constant in\ntime.\nThe network oscillates in response to either constant or tuned input. Fig-\nure 7.23A shows the time average of the oscillating activities of the neu-rons in the network as a function of their preferred angles for noisy tuned(solid curve) and untuned (dashed curve) inputs. Neurons respond to thetuned input in a highly tuned and ampli \ufb01ed manner. Despite the high de-\ngree of amplication, the average response of the neurons to untuned inputis almost independent of\n\u03b8. Figures 7.23B and 7.23C show the activities of\nindividual neurons with \u03b8=0\u25e6(\u2019o\u2019) and \u03b8=\u2212 37\u25e6) (\u2018x\u2019) over time for the\ntuned and untuned inputs respectively. The network does not producepersistent perception, because the output to an untuned input is itself un-tuned. In contrast, a non-oscillatory version of this network, with\n\u03c4I=0,\nexhibits tuned sustained activity in response to an untuned intput for re-current weights this strong. The oscillatory network can thus operate in aregime of high selective ampli \ufb01cation without generating spurious tuned\nactivity.\n7.6 Stochastic Networks\nUp to this point, we have considered models in which the output of a cell isa deterministic function of its input. In this section, we consider a networkmodel called the Boltzmann machine in which the input-output relation- Boltzmann\nmachine ship is stochastic. Boltzmann machines are interesting from the perspec-\ntive of learning, and also because they offer an alternative interpretationof the dynamics of network models.\nIn the simplest form of Boltzmann machine, the neurons are treated as\nbinary, so\nva(t)=1 if unit ais active at time t(e.g. it \ufb01res a spike between\ntimes tand t+/Delta1tfor some small value of /Delta1t), and va(t)=0 if it is inactive.\nThe state of unit ais determined by its total input current,\nIa(t)=ha(t)+Nv/summationdisplay\na/prime=1Maa/primeva/prime(t), (7.52)\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n46 Network Models\n0 250 50002004006008001000\ntime (ms)v(Hz)B\ntime (ms)C\n-90-45 04590050100150200\n\u03b8 (deg)average v(Hz)A\n0 250 50002004006008001000\nFigure 7.23: Selective ampli \ufb01cation in an excitatory-inhibitory network.

In the model, units can only change state at\nintegral multiples of /Delta1t. At each time step, a single unit is selected, usually\nat random, to be updated. This update is based on a probabilistic ratherthan a deterministic rule. If unit ais selected, its state at the next time step\nis set stochastically to 1 with probability\nP[\nva(t+/Delta1t)=1]=F(Ia(t))with F(Ia)=1\n1+exp(\u2212Ia). (7.53)\nOf course, it follows that P[va(t+/Delta1t)=0]=1\u2212F(Ia(t)).Fis a sigmoidal\nfunction, which has the property that the larger the value of Ia,t h em o r e\nlikely unit ais to take the value one.\nUnder equation 7.53, the state of activity of the network evolves as a\nMarkov chain. This means that the components of vat different times are Markov chain\nsequences of random variables with the property that v(t+1)depends\nonly on v(t), and not on the previous history of the network. The update\nof equation 7.53 is known as Glauber dynamics. Glauber dynamics\nAn advantage of using Glauber dyanmics to de \ufb01ne the evolution of a net-\nwork model is that general results from statistical mechanics can be usedto determine the equilibrium distribution of activities. Under Glauber dy-namics, vdoes not converge to a \ufb01xed point, but can be described by a\nprobability distribution associated with an energy function energy function\nE\n(v)=\u2212h\u00b7v\u22121\n2v\u00b7M\u00b7v.

(7.55)\nThe notion of convergence as t\u2192\u221e can be formalized precisely, but in-\nformally, it means that after repeated updating according to equation 7.53,the states of the network are described statistically by equation 7.55. Z\nis called the partition function and P[v] the Boltzmann distribution. Un- partition function\nBoltzmann\ndistributionder the Boltzmann distribution, states with lower energies are more likely.\nIn this case, Glauber dynamics implements a statistical operation calledGibbs sampling for the distribution given in equation 7.55.Gibbs sampling\nThe Boltzmann machine is an inherently stochastic device. An approxima-\ntion to the Boltzmann machine, known as the mean- \ufb01eld approximation, mean- \ufb01eld\napproximation can be constructed on the basis of the deterministic synaptic current dy-\nnamics of a \ufb01ring-rate model. In this case, Iis determined by the dynamic\nequation 7.39 rather than by equation 7.52, and the model runs in contin-uous rather than discrete time. The function Fin equation 7.39 is taken to\nbe the same sigmoidal function as in equation 7.53. Although the mean-\ufb01eld formulation of the Boltzmann machine is inherently deterministic,\nF\n(Ia)can be used to generate a probability distribution over a binary out-\nput vector v. This is done by treating the output of each unit a,va,a sa n\nindependent binary variable set to either 1 or 0 with probability F(Ia)or\n1\u2212F(Ia)respectively. This replaces the deterministic rule va=F(Ia)used\nin the \ufb01ring-rate version of the model. Because va=1 has probability F(Ia)\nandva=0 probability 1 \u2212F(Ia)and the units are independent, the proba-\nbility distribution for the entire vector vis\nQ[v]=Nv/productdisplay\na=1F(Ia)va(1\u2212F(Ia))1\u2212va. (7.56)\nThis is called the mean- \ufb01eld distribution for the Boltzmann machine. Note mean \ufb01eld\ndistribution that this distribution (and indeed vitself) plays no role in the dynamics of\nthe mean- \ufb01eld formulation of the Boltzmann machine. It is rather a way\nof interpreting the outputs.\nWe have presented two formulations of the Boltzmann machine, Gibbs\nsampling and the mean- \ufb01eld approach, that lead to the two distributions\nP[v] and Q[v] (equations 7.55 and 7.56). The Lyapunov function of equa-\ntion 7.40, that decreases steadily under the dynamics of equation 7.39 un-til a\ufb01xed point is reached, provides a key insight into the relationship\nbetween these two distributions. In the appendix, we show that this Lya-punov function can be expressed as\nL\n(I)=DKL(Q,P)+K (7.57)\nwhere Kis a constant, and DKLis the Kullback-Liebler divergence de \ufb01ned\nin chapter 4. DKL(Q,P)is a measure of how different the two distributions\nQand Pare from each other. The fact that the dynamics of equation 7.39\nDraft: December 19, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n48 Network Models\nreduces the Lyapunov function to a minimum value means that it also\nreduces the difference between Qand P, as measured by the Kullback-\nLiebler divergence. This offers an interesting interpretation of the mean-\ufb01eld dynamics; it modi \ufb01es the current value of the vector Iuntil the dis-\ntribution of binary output values generated by the mean- \ufb01eld formulation\nof the Boltzmann machine matches as closely as possible (to at least a localminimum of D\nKL(Q,P)) the distribution generated by Gibbs sampling. In\nthis way, the mean- \ufb01eld procedure can be viewed as an approximation of\nGibbs sampling.\nThe power of the Boltzmann machine lies in the relationship between the\ndistribution of output values, equation 7.55, and the quadratic energyfunction of equation 7.54. This makes it is possible to determine howchanging the weights Maffects the distribution of output states. In chap-\nter 8, we present a learning rule for the weights of the Boltzmann machinethat allows P[v] to approximate a probability distribution extracted from\na set of inputs. In chapter 10, we study other models that construct outputdistributions in this way.\nNote that the mean \ufb01eld distribution Q[v] is simpler than the full Boltz-\nmann distribution P[v] because the units are statistically independent.\nThis prevents Q[v] from providing a good approximation in some cases,\nparticularly if there are negative weights between units, which tend tomake their activities mutually exclusive. Correlations such as these in the\ufb02uctuations of the states about their mean values can be important for\nlearning. The mean- \ufb01eld analysis of the Boltzmann machine illustrates\nthe limitations of rate-based descriptions in capturing the full extent of thecorrelations that can exist between spiking neurons.\n7.7 Chapter Summary\nThe models in this chapter mark the start of our discussion of computa-tion, as opposed to coding. Using a description of the \ufb01ring rates of net-\nwork neurons, we showed how to construct linear and nonlinear feedfor-ward and recurrent networks that transform information from one coordi-nate system to another, selectively amplify input signals, integrate inputsover extended periods of time, select between competing inputs, sustainactivity in the absence of input, exhibit gain modulation, allow simple de-coding with performance near the Cram \u00b4er-Rao bound, and act as content\naddressable memories. We used network responses to a continuous stim-ulus variable as an extended example. This led to models of simple andcomplex cells in primary visual cortex. We described a model of the ol-factory bulb as an example of a system for which computation involvesoscillations arising from asymmetric couplings between excitatory and in-hibitory neurons. Linear stability analysis was applied to a simpli \ufb01ed ver-\nsion of this model. We also considered a stochastic network model calledthe Boltzmann machine.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\n7.7 Chapter Summary 49\nAppendix\nLyapunov Function for the Boltzmann Machine\nHere, we show that the Lyapunov function of equation 7.40 can be reduced\nto equation 7.57 when applied to the mean- \ufb01eld version of the Boltzmann\nmachine.

Abbott Draft: December 19, 2000\nChapter 8\nPlasticity and Learning\n8.1 Introduction\nActivity-dependent synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the basic\nphenomenon underlying learning and memory, and it is also thought toplay a crucial role in the development of neural circuits. To understandthe functional and behavioral signi \ufb01cance of synaptic plasticity, we must\nstudy how experience and training modify synapses, and how these mod-i\ufb01cations change patterns of neuronal \ufb01ring to affect behavior. Experimen-\ntal work has revealed ways in which neuronal activity can affect synapticstrength, and experimentally inspired synaptic plasticity rules have beenapplied to a wide variety of tasks including auto- and hetero-associativememory, pattern recognition, storage and recall of temporal sequences,and function approximation.\nIn 1949, Donald Hebb conjectured that if input from neuron A often con-\ntributes to the \ufb01ring of neuron B, the synapse from A to B should be\nstrengthened. Hebb suggested that such synaptic modi \ufb01cation could pro- Hebb rule\nduce neuronal assemblies that re \ufb02ect the relationships experienced dur-\ning training. The Hebb rule forms the basis of much of the research doneon the role of synaptic plasticity in learning and memory. For example,consider applying this rule to neurons that \ufb01re together during training\ndue to an association between a stimulus and a response. These neu-rons would develop strong interconnections, and subsequent activationof some of them by the stimulus could produce the synaptic drive neededto activate the remaining neurons and generate the associated response.Hebb\u2019s original suggestion concerned increases in synaptic strength, butit has been generalized to include decreases in strength arising from therepeated failure of neuron A to be involved in the activation of neuron B.General forms of the Hebb rule state that synapses change in proportion tothe correlation or covariance of the activities of the pre- and postsynapticneurons.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Plasticity and Learning\n00.10.20.30.4\n1\n100s\nHz10\n2min\nHzfield potential amplitude ( mV)\ntime (min)01 02 03 0 40LTP\nLTD\ncontrol leveldepressed, partially\ndepotentiated levelpotentiated level\nFigure 8.1: LTP and LTD at the Schaffer collateral inputs to the CA1 region of a\nrat hippocampal slice.

Some of this increase decayed away following the stimulation, butmost of it remained over the following 15 min test period, indicating LTP. Next,stimulation at 2 Hz was applied for 10 min (between times 20 and 30 minutes).This reduced that amplitude of the response. After a transient dip, the responseamplitude remained at a reduced level approximately midway between the origi-nal and post-LTP values, indicating LTD. The arrows at the right show the levelsinitially (control), after LTP (potentiated), and after LTD (depressed, partially de-potentiated). (Unpublished data of J Fitzpatrick and J Lisman.)\nExperimental work in a number of brain regions including hippocampus,\nneocortex, and cerebellum, has revealed activity-dependent processes thatcan produce changes in the ef \ufb01cacies of synapses that persist for vary-\ning amounts of time. Figure 8.1 shows an example in which the datapoints indicate amplitudes of \ufb01eld potentials evoked in the CA1 region\nof a slice of rat hippocampus by stimulation of the Schaffer collateral af-ferents. In experiments such as this, \ufb01eld potential amplitudes (or more\noften slopes) are used as a measure of synaptic strength. In Figure 8.1,high-frequency stimulation induced synaptic potentiation (an increase in potentiation\nstrength), and then long-lasting, low-frequency stimulation resulted insynaptic depression (a decrease in strength) that partially removed the depression\neffects of the previous potentiation. This is in accord with a generalizedHebb rule because high-frequency presynaptic stimulation evokes a post-synaptic response, whereas low-frequency stimulation does not. Changesin synaptic strength involve both transient and long-lasting effects, as seenin\ufb01gure 8.1. The longest-lasting forms appear to require protein synthe-\nsis. Changes that persist for tens of minutes or longer are generally calledlong-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). Inhibitory LTP and LTD\nsynapses can also display plasticity, but this has been less thoroughly in-vestigated both experimentally and theoretically, and we focus on the plas-\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The postsynaptic concentration of calciumions appears to play a critical role in the induction of both long-term poten-tiation and depression. However, we will not consider mechanistic mod-els. Rather, we study synaptic plasticity at a functional level, attemptingto relate the impact of synaptic plasticity on neurons and networks to thebasic rules governing its induction.\nStudies of plasticity and learning involve analyzing how synapses are af-\nfected by activity over the course of a training period. In this and thefollowing chapters, we consider three types of training procedures. In un-supervised (or sometimes self-supervised) learning, a network responds unsupervised\nlearning to a series of inputs during training solely on the basis of its intrinsic con-\nnections and dynamics. The network then self-organizes in a manner thatdepends on the synaptic plasticity rule being applied and on the natureof inputs presented during training. We consider unsupervised learningin a more general setting called density estimation in chapter 10. In su-pervised learning, which we consider in the last section of this chapter, a supervised\nlearning desired set of input-output relationships is imposed on the network by a\n\u2018teacher\u2019 during training. Networks that perform particular tasks can beconstructed in this way by letting a modi \ufb01cation rule adjust the synapses\nuntil the desired computation emerges as a consequence of the trainingprocess. This is an alternative to explicitly specifying the synaptic weights,as was done in chapter 7. In this case, \ufb01nding a biological plausible teach-\ning mechanism may not be a concern, if the scienti \ufb01c question being ad-\ndressed is whether any weights can be found that allow a network to im-plement a particular function. In more biologically plausible examples ofsupervised learning, one network can act as the teacher for another net-work. In chapter 9, we discuss a third form of learning, reinforcementlearning, that is somewhat intermediate between these cases. In reinforce- reinforcement\nlearning ment learning, the network output is not constrained by a teacher, but\nevaluative feedback on network performance is provided in the form ofreward or punishment. This can be used to control the synaptic modi \ufb01ca-\ntion process. We will see that the same synaptic plasticity rule can be usedfor different types of learning procedures.\nIn this chapter we focus on activity-dependent synaptic plasticity of the\nHebbian type, meaning plasticity based on correlations of pre- and post-synaptic \ufb01ring. To ensure stability and to obtain interesting results, we\nmust often augment Hebbian plasticity with more global forms of synapticmodi \ufb01cation that, for example, scale the strengths of all the synapses onto\na given neuron. These can have a major impact on the outcome of develop-ment or learning. Non-Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity, such as those non-Hebbian\nplasticity that modify synaptic strengths solely on the basis of pre- or postsynaptic\n\ufb01ring, are likely to play important roles in homeostatic, developmental,\nand learning processes. Activity can also modify the intrinsic excitabil-ity and response properties of neurons. Models of such intrinsic plasticity\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Plasticity and Learning\nshow that neurons can be remarkably robust to external perturbations if\nthey adjust their conductances to maintain speci \ufb01ed functional character-\nistics. Intrinsic and synaptic plasticity can interact in interesting ways. Forexample, shifts in intrinsic excitability can compensate for changes in thelevel of input to a neuron caused by synaptic plasticity. It is likely that allof these forms of plasticity, and many others, are important elements ofboth the stability and adaptability of nervous systems.\nIn this chapter, we describe and analyze basic correlation- and covariance-\nbased synaptic plasticity rules in the context of unsupervised learning, anddiscuss their extension to supervised learning. One running example is thedevelopment of ocular dominance in single cells in primary visual cortexand the ocular dominance stripes they collectively form.\nStability and Competition\nIncreasing synaptic strength in response to activity is a positive feedbackprocess. The activity that modi \ufb01es synapses is reinforced by Hebbian plas-\nticity, which leads to more activity and further modi \ufb01cation. Without ap-\npropriate adjustments of the synaptic plasticity rules or the imposition ofconstraints, Hebbian modi \ufb01cation tends to produce uncontrolled growth\nof synaptic strengths.\nThe easiest way to control synaptic strengthening is to impose an upper\nlimit on the value that a synaptic weight (de \ufb01ned as in chapter 7) can take.\nSuch an upper limit is supported by LTP experiments. Further, it makessense to prevent weights from changing sign, because the plasticity pro-cesses we are modeling cannot change an excitatory synapse into an in-hibitory synapse or vice versa. We therefore impose the constraint, whichwe call a saturation constraint, that all excitatory synaptic weights must lie synaptic saturation\nbetween zero and a maximum value\nwmax, which is a constant. The sim-\nplest implementation of saturation is to set any weight that would crossa saturation bound due to application of a plasticity rule to the limitingvalue.\nUncontrolled growth is not the only problem associated with Hebbian\nplasticity. Synapses are modi \ufb01ed independently under a Hebbian rule,\nwhich can have deleterious consequences. For example, all of the synapticweights may be driven to their maximum allowed values\nwmax, causing\nthe postsynaptic neuron to lose selectivity to different patterns of input.The development of input selectivity typically requires competition be-tween different synapses, so that some are forced to weaken when others synaptic\ncompetition become strong. We discuss a variety of synaptic plasticity rules that intro-\nduce competition between synapses. In some cases, the same mechanismthat leads to competition also stabilizes growth of the synaptic weights. Inother cases, it does not, and saturation constraints must also be imposed.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.2 Synaptic Plasticity Rules 5\n8.2 Synaptic Plasticity Rules\nRules for synaptic modi \ufb01cation take the form of differential equations de-\nscribing the rate of change of synaptic weights as a function of the pre-and postsynaptic activity and other possible factors. In this section, wegive examples of such rules. In later sections, we discuss their computa-tional implications.\nIn the models of plasticity we study, the activity of each neuron is de-\nscribed by a continuous variable, not by a spike train. As in chapter 7, weuse the letter uto denote the presynaptic level of activity and\nvto denote\nthe postsynaptic activity. Normally, uandvrepresent the \ufb01ring rates of\nthe pre- and postsynaptic neurons, in which case they should be restrictedto non-negative values. Sometimes, to simplify the analysis, we ignorethis constraint. An activity variable that takes both positive and nega-tive values can be interpreted as the difference between a \ufb01ring rate and\na\ufb01xed background rate, or between the \ufb01ring rates of two neurons being\ntreated as a single unit. Finally, to avoid extraneous conversion factors inour equations, we take uand\nvto be dimensionless measures of the cor-\nresponding neuronal \ufb01ring rates or activities. For example, uandvcould\nbe the \ufb01ring rates of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons divided by their\nmaximum or average values.\nIn the \ufb01rst part of this chapter, we consider unsupervised learning as ap-\nplied to a single postsynaptic neuron driven by Nupresynaptic inputs with\nactivities represented by ubforb=1,2,..., Nu, or collectively by the vec-\ntoru. Because we study unsupervised learning, the postsynaptic activity\nvis evoked directly by the presynaptic activity u, not by an external agent.\nWe use a linear version of the \ufb01ring-rate model discussed in chapter 7,\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+w\u00b7u=\u2212v+Nu/summationdisplay\nb=1wbub (8.1)\nwhere \u03c4ris a time constant that controls the \ufb01ring rate response dynam-\nics. Recall that wbis the synaptic weight that describes the strength of\nthe synapse from presynaptic neuron bto the postsynaptic neuron, and w\nis the vector formed by all Nusynaptic weights. The individual synaptic wweight vector\nweights can be either positive, representing excitation, or negative, rep-resenting inhibition. Equation 8.1 does not include any nonlinear depen-dence of the \ufb01ring rate on the total synaptic input, not even recti \ufb01cation.\nUsing such a linear \ufb01ring-rate model considerably simpli \ufb01es the analysis\nof synaptic plasticity. The restriction to non-negative\nvwill either be im-\nposed by hand, or sometimes it will be ignored to simplify the analysis.\nThe processes of synaptic plasticity are typically much slower than the\ndynamics characterized by equation 8.1. If, in addition, the stimuli arepresented slowly enough to allow the network to attain its steady-stateactivity during training, we can replace the dynamic equation 8.1 by\nv=w\u00b7u, (8.2)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Plasticity and Learning\nwhich sets vinstantaneously to the asymptotic, steady-state value deter-\nmined by equation 8.1. This is the equation we primarily use in our anal-ysis of synaptic plasticity in unsupervised learning. Synaptic modi \ufb01ca-\ntion is included in the model by specifying how the vector wchanges as a\nfunction of the pre- and postsynaptic levels of activity. The complex time-course of plasticity seen in \ufb01gure 8.1 is simpli \ufb01ed by modeling only the\nlonger-lasting changes.\nThe Basic Hebb Rule\nThe simplest plasticity rule that follows the spirit of Hebb\u2019s conjecturetakes the form\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=vu, (8.3)\nwhich implies that simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic \ufb01ring increases\nsynaptic strength. We call this the basic Hebb rule. If the activity variables basic Hebb rule\nrepresent \ufb01ring rates, the right side of this equation can be interpreted as\na measure of the probability that the pre- and postsynaptic neurons both\ufb01re spikes during a small time interval. Here,\n\u03c4wis a time constant that\ncontrols the rate at which the weights change.\nSynaptic plasticity is generally modeled as a slow process that gradually\nmodi \ufb01es synaptic weights over a time period during which the compo-\nnents of utake a variety of different values. Each set of uvalues is called\nan input pattern. The direct way to compute the weight changes inducedby a series of input patterns is to sum the small changes caused by eachof them separately. A convenient alternative is to average over all of thedifferent input patterns and compute the weight changes induced by thisaverage. As long as the synaptic weights change slowly enough, the aver-aging method provides a good approximation of the weight changes pro-duced by the set of input patterns.\nIn this chapter, we use angle brackets\n/angbracketleft/angbracketrightto denote averages over the en-\nsemble of input patterns presented during training (which is a slightly dif-ferent usage from earlier chapters). The Hebb rule of equation 8.3, whenaveraged over the inputs used during training, becomes averaged Hebb rule\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=/angbracketleftvu/angbracketright. (8.4)\nIn unsupervised learning, vis determined by equation 8.2, and, if we re-\nplacevbyw\u00b7u, we can rewrite the averaged plasticity rule (equation 8.4)\nas correlation-based\nrule\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=Q\u00b7wor\u03c4wdwb\ndt=Nu/summationdisplay\nb/prime=1Qbb/primewb/prime (8.5)\nwhere Qis the input correlation matrix given by Qinput correlation\nmatrix\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.2 Synaptic Plasticity Rules 7\nQ=/angbracketleftuu/angbracketrightor Qbb/prime=/angbracketleftubub/prime/angbracketright. (8.6)\nEquation 8.5 is called a correlation-based plasticity rule because of the\npresence of the input correlation matrix.\nWhether or not the pre- and postsynaptic activity variables are restricted to\nnon-negative values, the basic Hebb rule is unstable. To show this, we con-sider the square of the length of the weight vector,\n|w|2=w\u00b7w=/summationtext\nbw2\nb.\nTaking the dot product of equation 8.3 with wand noting that d|w|2/dt=\n2w\u00b7dw/dtand that w\u00b7u=v,w e\ufb01nd that \u03c4wd|w|2/dt=2v2, which is al-\nways positive (except in the trivial case v=0). Thus, the length of the\nweight vector grows continuously when the rule 8.3 is applied. To avoidunbounded growth, we must impose an upper saturation constraint. Alower limit is also required if the activity variables are allowed to be nega-tive. Even with saturation, the basic Hebb rule fails to induce competitionbetween different synapses.\nSometimes, we think of the presentation of patterns over discrete rather\nthan continuous time. In this case, the effect of equation 8.5, integratedover a time Twhile ignoring the weight changes that occur during this\nperiod, is approximated by making the replacement\nw\n\u2192w+T\n\u03c4wQ\u00b7w. (8.7)\nThe Covariance Rule\nIf, as in Hebb\u2019s original conjecture, uandvare interpreted as represent-\ning\ufb01ring rates (which must be positive), the basic Hebb rule only de-\nscribes LTP. Experiments, such as the one shown in \ufb01gure 8.1, indicate\nthat synapses can depress in strength if presynaptic activity is accompa-nied by a low level of postsynaptic activity. High levels of postsynapticactivity, on the other hand, produce potentiation. These results can bemodeled by a synaptic plasticity rule of the form\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=(v\u2212\u03b8v)u (8.8)\nwhere \u03b8vis a threshold that determines the level of postsynaptic activ- \u03b8vpostsynaptic\nthreshold ity above which LTD switches to LTP. As an alternative to equation 8.8,\nwe can impose the threshold on the input rather than output activity andwrite\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=v(u\u2212\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8u). (8.9)\nHere\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8uis a vector of thresholds that determines the levels of presynaptic\nactivities above which LTD switches to LTP. It is also possible to combine \u03b8\u03b8\u03b8upresynaptic\nthreshold these two rules by subtracting thresholds from both the uandvterms, but\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Plasticity and Learning\nthis has the undesirable feature of predicting LTP when pre- and postsy-\nnaptic activity levels are both low.\nA convenient choice for the thresholds is the average value of the corre-\nsponding variable over the training period. In other words, we set thethreshold in equation 8.8 to the average postsynaptic activity,\n\u03b8v=/angbracketleftv/angbracketright,o r\nthe threshold vector in equation 8.9 to the average presynaptic activity vec-tor,\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8u=/angbracketleftu/angbracketright. As we did for equation 8.5, we use the relation v=w\u00b7uand\naverage over training inputs to obtain an averaged form of the plasticityrule. When the thresholds are set to their corresponding activity averages,equations 8.8 and 8.9 both produce the same averaged rule, Cinput covariance\nmatrix\ncovariance rules\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=C\u00b7w (8.10)\nwhere Cis the input covariance matrix,\nC=/angbracketleft(u\u2212/angbracketleftu/angbracketright)(u\u2212/angbracketleftu/angbracketright)/angbracketright=/angbracketleftuu/angbracketright\u2212/angbracketleft u/angbracketright/angbracketleftu/angbracketright=/angbracketleft(u\u2212/angbracketleftu/angbracketright)u/angbracketright. (8.11)\nBecause of the presence of the covariance matrix in equation 8.10, equa-\ntions 8.8 and 8.9 are known as covariance rules.\nAlthough they both average to give equation 8.10, the rules in equations\n8.8 and 8.9 have their differences. Equation 8.8 only modi \ufb01es synapses\nwith nonzero presynaptic activities. When v<\u03b8 v, this produces an ef-\nfect called homosynaptic depression. In contrast, equation 8.9 reduces the homosynaptic and\nheterosynapticdepressionstrengths of inactive synapses if\nv> 0. This is called heterosynaptic de-\npression. Note that the threshold in equation 8.8 must change as theweights are modi \ufb01ed to keep\n\u03b8v=/angbracketleftv/angbracketright, whereas the threshold in equa-\ntion 8.9 is independent of the weights and does not need to change duringthe training period to keep\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8u=/angbracketleftu/angbracketright.\nEven though covariance rules include LTD, allowing weights to decrease,\nthey are unstable because of the same positive feedback that makes thebasic Hebb rule unstable. For either rule 8.8 with\n\u03b8v=/angbracketleftv/angbracketrightor rule 8.9 with\n\u03b8\u03b8\u03b8u=/angbracketleftu/angbracketright,d|w|2/dt=2v(v\u2212/angbracketleftv/angbracketright). The time average of the right side of this\nequation is proportional to the variance of the output, /angbracketleftv2/angbracketright\u2212/angbracketleftv/angbracketright2, which is\npositive except in the trivial case when vis constant. The covariance rules,\nlike the Hebb rule, are non-competitive, but competition can be introducedby allowing the thresholds to slide, as described below.\nThe BCM Rule\nThe covariance-based rule of equation 8.8 does not require any postsy-naptic activity to produce LTD, and rule 8.9 can produce LTD withoutpresynaptic activity. Bienenstock, Cooper and Munro (1982), suggested analternative plasticity rule, for which there is experimental evidence, thatrequires both pre- and postsynaptic activity to change a synaptic weight.This rule, which is called the BCM rule, takes the form BCM rule\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.2 Synaptic Plasticity Rules 9\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=vu(v\u2212\u03b8v). (8.12)\nAs in equation 8.8, \u03b8vacts as a threshold on the postsynaptic activity that\ndetermines whether synapses are strengthened or weakened.\nIf the threshold \u03b8vis held \ufb01xed, the BCM rule, like the basic Hebbian rule,\nis unstable. Synaptic modi \ufb01cation can be stabilized against unbounded\ngrowth by allowing the threshold to vary. The critical condition for stabil-ity is that\n\u03b8vmust grow more rapidly than vif the output activity grows\nlarge. In one instantiation of the BCM rule with a sliding threshold, \u03b8v sliding threshold\nfollows v2according to the equation\n\u03c4\u03b8d\u03b8v\ndt=v2\u2212\u03b8v (8.13)\nwhere \u03c4\u03b8sets the time scale for modi \ufb01cation of the threshold. This is usu-\nally slower than the presentation of individual presynaptic patterns, butfaster than the rate at which the weights change, which is determined by\n\u03c4w. With a sliding threshold, the BCM rule implements competition be-\ntween synapses because strengthening some synapses increases the post-synaptic \ufb01ring rate, which raises the threshold and makes it more dif \ufb01cult\nfor other synapses to be strengthened or even to remain at their currentstrengths.\nSynaptic Normalization\nThe BCM rule stabilizes Hebbian plasticity by means of a sliding thresh-old that reduces synaptic weights if the postsynaptic neuron becomes tooactive. This amounts to using the postsynaptic activity as an indicator ofthe strengths of synaptic weights. A more direct way to stabilize a Heb-bian plasticity rule is to add terms that depend explicitly on the weights.This typically leads to some form of weight normalization, the idea thatpostsynaptic neurons can only support a \ufb01xed total synaptic weight, so\nincreases in some weights must be accompanied by decreases in others.\nNormalization of synaptic weights involves imposing some sort of global\nconstraint. Two types of constraints are typically used. If the synapticweights are non-negative, their growth can be limited by holding the sumof all the weights of the synapses onto a given postsynaptic neuron to aconstant value. An alternative, which also works for weights that can beeither positive or negative, is to constrain the sum of the squares of theweights instead of their linear sum. In either case, the constraint can beimposed either rigidly, requiring that it be satis \ufb01ed at all times during a\ntraining process, or dynamically, only requiring that it be satis \ufb01ed asymp-\ntotically at the end of training. We discuss one example of each type; arigid scheme for imposing a constraint on the sum of synaptic weights anda dynamic scheme for constraining the sum over their squares. Dynamicconstraints can be applied in the former case and rigid constraints in the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Plasticity and Learning\nlatter, but we restrict our discussion to two widely used schemes. We dis-\ncuss synaptic normalization in connection with the basic Hebb rule, butthe results we present can be applied to covariance rules as well. Weightnormalization can drastically alter the outcome of a training procedure,and different normalization methods may lead to different outcomes.\nSubtractive Normalization\nThe sum over synaptic weights that is constrained by subtractive normal-\nization can be written as/summationtext\nwb=n\u00b7wwhere nis an Nu-dimensional vector\nwith all its components equal to one (as introduced in chapter 7). This sumcan be constrained by replacing equation 8.3 with Hebb rule with\nsubtractivenormalization\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=vu\u2212v(n\u00b7u)n\nNu(8.14)\nThis rule imposes what is called subtractive normalization because the\nsame quantity is subtracted from the change to each weight whether thatweight is large or small. Subtractive normalization imposes the constrainton the sum of weights rigidly because it does not allow the Hebbian termto change n\n\u00b7w. To see this, we take the dot product of equation 8.14 with\nnto obtain\n\u03c4wdn\u00b7w\ndt=vn\u00b7u/parenleftbigg\n1\u2212n\u00b7n\nNu/parenrightbigg\n=0. (8.15)\nThe last equality follows because n\u00b7n=Nu. Hebbian modi \ufb01cation with\nsubtractive normalization is non-local in that it requires the value of thesum of all weights, n\n\u00b7wto be available to the mechanism that modi \ufb01es\nany particular synapse. This scheme could conceivably be implementedby some form of intracellular signaling system.\nSubtractive normalization must be augmented by a saturation constraint\nthat prevents weights from becoming negative. If the rule 8.14 attemptsto drive any of the weights below zero, the saturation constraint preventsthis change. At this point, the rule is not applied to any saturated weights,and its effect on the other weights is modi \ufb01ed. Both modi \ufb01cations can be\nachieved by setting the components of the vector ncorresponding to any\nsaturated weights to zero and the factor of N\nuin equation 8.14 equal to\nthe sum of the components of this modi \ufb01ednvector. Without any upper\nsaturation limit, this procedure often results in a \ufb01nal outcome in which\nall weights but one have been set to zero. To avoid this, an upper satu-ration limit is also typically imposed. Hebbian plasticity with subtractivenormalization is highly competitive because small weights are reduced bya larger proportion of their sizes than large weights.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.2 Synaptic Plasticity Rules 11\nMultiplicative Normalization and the Oja Rule\nA constraint on the sum of the squares of the synaptic weights can be im-\nposed dynamically using a modi \ufb01cation of the basic Hebb rule known as\nthe Oja rule (Oja, 1982), Oja rule\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=vu\u2212\u03b1v2w (8.16)\nwhere \u03b1is a positive constant. This rule only involves information that\nis local to the synapse being modi \ufb01ed, namely the pre- and postsynap-\ntic activities and the local synaptic weight, but its form is based more ontheoretical arguments than on experimental data. The normalization it im-poses is called multiplicative because the amount of modi \ufb01cation induced\nby the second term in equation 8.16 is proportional to w.\nThe stability of the Oja rule can be established by repeating the analysis of\nchanges in length of the weight vector presented above to \ufb01nd that\n\u03c4wd|w|2\ndt=2v2(1\u2212\u03b1|w|2). (8.17)\nThis indicates that |w|2will relax over time to the value 1 /\u03b1, which ob-\nviously prevents the weights from growing without bound, proving sta-bility. It also induces competition between the different weights because,when one weight increases, the maintenance of a constant length for theweight vector forces other weights to decrease.\nTiming-Based Rules\nExperiments have shown that the relative timing of pre- and postsynapticaction potentials plays a critical role in determining the sign and ampli-tude of the changes in synaptic ef \ufb01cacy produced by activity. Figure 8.2\nshows examples from an intracellular recording of a pair of cortical pyra-midal cells in a slice experiment, and from an in vivo experiment on retino-\ntectal synapses in a Xenopus tadpole. Both experiments involve repeated\npairing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials, and both show that therelative timing of these spikes is critical in determining the amount andtype of synaptic modi \ufb01cation that takes place. Synaptic plasticity only oc-\ncurs if the difference in the pre- and postsynaptic spike times falls within awindow of roughly\n\u00b150 ms. Within this window, the sign of the synaptic\nmodi \ufb01cation depends on the order of stimulation. Presynaptic spikes that\nprecede postsynaptic action potentials produce LTP. Presynaptic spikesthat follow postsynaptic action potentials produce LTD. This is in accordwith Hebb\u2019s original conjecture, because a synapse is strengthened onlywhen a presynaptic action potential precedes a postsynaptic action poten-tial and can therefore be interpreted as contributing to it. When the order isreversed and the presynaptic action potential could not have contributed\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Plasticity and Learning\n-50\n(\u00b1100 ms)\n0 25 50100110120130140\n90\n80\n70epsp amplitude (% of control)B A\n(+10 ms)\n(-10 ms)\n-100 5090\n60\n30\n0\n-60-30percent potentiation\n100 0\ntime (min) tpost - tpre (ms)\nFigure 8.2: LTP and LTD produced by paired action potentials with various tim-\nings.

The\nHfunction in equation 8.18 is proportional to the solid curve. (A adapted from\nMarkram et al., 1997; B adapted from Zhang et al., 1998.)\nto the postsynaptic response, the synapse is weakened. The maximum\namount of synaptic modi \ufb01cation occurs when the paired spikes are sepa-\nrated by only a few ms, and the evoked plasticity decreases to zero as thisseparation increases.\nSimulating the spike-timing dependence of synaptic plasticity requires a\nspiking model. However, an approximate model can be constructed on thebasis of \ufb01ring rates. The effect of pre- and postsynaptic timing can be in-\ncluded in a synaptic modi \ufb01cation rule by including a temporal difference\n\u03c4between the times when the \ufb01ring rates of the pre- and postsynaptic neu-\nrons are evaluated. A function H(\u03c4)determines the rate of synaptic mod-\ni\ufb01cation that occurs due to postsynaptic activity separated in time from\npresynaptic activity by an interval \u03c4. The total rate of synaptic modi \ufb01ca-\ntion is determined by integrating over all time differences \u03c4. If we assume\nthat the rate of synaptic modi \ufb01cation is proportional to the product of the\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Thesolid curve in \ufb01gure 8.2B is an example of such an Hfunction. The tem-\nporal asymmetry of Hhas a dramatic effect on synaptic weight changes\nbecause it causes them to depend on the temporal order of the activityduring training. Among other things, this allows synaptic weights to storeinformation about temporal sequences.\nRules in which synaptic plasticity is based on the relative timing of pre-\nand postsynaptic action potentials still require saturation constraints forstability, but they can generate competition between synapses without fur-ther constraints or modi \ufb01cations, at least in nonlinear, spike-based mod-\nels. This is because different synapses compete for control of the timing ofpostsynaptic spikes. Synapses that are able to evoke postsynaptic spikesrapidly get strengthened. These synapses then exert a more powerful in-\ufb02uence on the timing of postsynaptic spikes, and they tend to generate\nspikes at times that lead to the weakening of other synapses less capableof controlling spike timing.\n8.3 Unsupervised Learning\nWe now consider the computational properties of the different synapticmodi \ufb01cation rules we have introduced, in the context of unsupervised\nlearning. Unsupervised learning provides a model for the effects of ac-tivity on developing neural circuits and the effects of experience on ma-ture networks. We separate the discussion of unsupervised learning intocases involving a single postsynaptic neuron and cases in which there aremultiple postsynaptic neurons.\nSingle Postsynaptic Neuron\nEquation 8.5, which shows the consequence of averaging the basic Hebbrule over all the presynaptic training patterns, is a linear equation for w.\nProvided that we ignore any constraints on w, it can be analyzed using\nstandard techniques for solving differential equations (see chapter 7 andthe Mathematical Appendix). In particular, we use the method of matrixdiagonalization, which involves expressing win terms of the eigenvectors\nofQ. These are denoted by e\n\u00b5with\u00b5=1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7,Nu, and they satisfy\nQ\u00b7e\u00b5=\u03bb\u00b5e\u00b5. For correlation or covariance matrices, all the eigenvalues,\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Plasticity and Learning\n\u03bb\u00b5for all \u00b5, are real and non-negative, and, for convenience, we order\nthem so that \u03bb1\u2265\u03bb2\u2265...\u2265\u03bbNu.\nAny Nu-dimensional vector can be represented using the eigenvectors as\na basis, so we can write\nw(t)=Nu/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1c\u00b5(t)e\u00b5 (8.19)\nwhere the coef \ufb01cients are equal to the dot products of the eigenvectors\nwith w. For example, at time zero c\u00b5(0)=w(0)\u00b7e\u00b5. Writing was a sum\nof eigenvectors turns matrix multiplication into ordinary multiplication,making calculations easier. Substituting the expansion 8.19 into 8.5 andfollowing the procedure presented in chapter 7 for isolating uncoupledequations for the coef \ufb01cients, we \ufb01nd that c\n\u00b5(t)=c\u00b5(0)exp(\u03bb\u00b5t/\u03c4w).G o -\ning back to equation 8.19, this means that\nw(t)=Nu/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1exp/parenleftbigg\u03bb\u00b5t\n\u03c4w/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig\nw(0)\u00b7e\u00b5/parenrightbig\ne\u00b5. (8.20)\nThe exponential factors in 8.20 all grow over time, because the eigenval-\nues\u03bb\u00b5are positive for all \u00b5values. For large t, the term with the largest\nvalue of \u03bb\u00b5(assuming it is unique) becomes much larger than any of the\nother terms and dominates the sum for w. This largest eigenvalue has the\nlabel\u00b5=1, and its corresponding eigenvector e1is called the principal\neigenvector. Thus, for large t,w\u221de1to a good approximation, provided principal\neigenvector that w(0)\u00b7e1/negationslash=0. After training, the response to an arbitrary input vector\nuis well-approximated by\nv\u221de1\u00b7u. (8.21)\nBecause the dot product corresponds to a projection of one vector onto an-\nother, Hebbian plasticity can be interpreted as producing an output pro-portional to the projection of the input vector onto the principal eigenvec-tor of the correlation matrix of the inputs used during training. We discussthe signi \ufb01cance of this result in the next section.\nThe proportionality sign in equation 8.21 hides the large factor exp\n(\u03bb1t/\u03c4w),\nwhich is a result of the positive feedback inherent in Hebbian plasticity.One way to limit growth of the weight vector in equation 8.5 is to im-pose a saturation constraint. This can have signi \ufb01cant effects on the out-\ncome of Hebbian modi \ufb01cation, including, in some cases, preventing the\nweight vector from ending up proportional to the principal eigenvector.Figure 8.3 shows examples of the Hebbian development of the weightsin a case with just two inputs. For the correlation matrix used in this ex-\nample, the principal eigenvector is e\n1=(1,\u22121)/\u221a\n2, so an analysis that\nignored saturation would predict that one weight would increase whilethe other decreases. Which weight moves in which direction is controlledby the initial conditions. Given the constraints, this would suggest that\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The correlation matrix of\nthe input vectors had diagonal elements equal to 1 and off-diagonal elements of\n-0.4. The principal eigenvector, e1=(1,\u22121)/\u221a\n2, dominates the dynamics if the\ninitial values of the weights are small enough (below and the the left of the dashedlines). This makes the weight vector move to the corners\n(wmax,0)or(0,w max).\nHowever, starting the weights with larger values (between the dashed lines) allowssaturation to occur at the corner\n(wmax,w max). (Adapted from MacKay and Miller,\n1990.)\n(wmax,0)and(0,wmax)are the most likely \ufb01nal con \ufb01gurations. This anal-\nysis only gives the correct answer for the regions in \ufb01gure 8.3 below or\nto the left of the dashed lines. Between the dashed lines, the \ufb01nal state is\nw=(wmax,wmax)because the weights hit the saturation boundary before\nthe exponential growth is large enough to allow the principal eigenvectorto dominate.\nAnother way to eliminate the large exponential factor in the weights is to\nuse the Oja rule, 8.16, instead of the basic Hebb rule. The weight vectorgenerated by the Oja rule, in the example we have discussed, approachesw\n=e1/(\u03b1)1/2ast\u2192\u221e . In other words, the Oja rule gives a weight vector\nthat is parallel to the principal eigenvector, but normalized to a length of1\n/(\u03b1)1/2rather than growing without bound.\nFinally, we examine the effect of including a subtractive constraint, as in\nequation 8.14. Averaging equation 8.14 over the training inputs, we \ufb01nd averaged Hebb rule\nwith subtractive\nconstraint \u03c4wdw\ndt=Q\u00b7w\u2212(w\u00b7Q\u00b7n)n\nNu. (8.22)\nIf we once again express was a sum of eigenvectors of Q,w e \ufb01nd that\nt h eg r o w t ho fe a c hc o e f \ufb01cient in this sum is unaffected by the extra term\nin equation 8.22 provided that e\u00b5\u00b7n=0. However, if e\u00b5\u00b7n/negationslash=0, the extra\nterm modi \ufb01es the growth. In our discussion of ocular dominance, we con-\nsider a case in which the principal eigenvector of the correlation matrix is\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Plasticity and Learning\nproportional to n. In this case, Q\u00b7e1\u2212(e1\u00b7Q\u00b7n)n/N=0 so the projection\nin the direction of the principal eigenvector is unaffected by the synapticplasticity rule. Further, e\n\u00b5\u00b7n=0f o r\u00b5\u22652 because the eigenvectors of the\ncorrelation matrix are mutually orthogonal, which implies that the evolu-tion of the remaining eigenvectors is unaffected by the constraint. As aresult,\nw\n(t)=(w(0)\u00b7e1)e1+Nu/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=2exp/parenleftbigg\u03bb\u00b5t\n\u03c4w/parenrightbigg/parenleftbig\nw(0)\u00b7e\u00b5/parenrightbig\ne\u00b5. (8.23)\nThus, ignoring the effects of any saturation constraints, the synaptic\nweight matrix tends to become parallel to the eigenvector with the secondlargest eigenvalue as t\n\u2192\u221e .\nIn summary, if weight growth is limited by some form of multiplicative\nnormalization, as in the Oja rule, the con \ufb01guration of synaptic weights\nproduced by Hebbian modi \ufb01cation will typically be proportional to the\nprincipal eigenvector of the input correlation matrix. When subtractivenormalization is used and the principal eigenvector is proportional to n,\nthe eigenvector with the next largest eigenvalue provides an estimate ofthe con \ufb01guration of \ufb01nal weights, again up to a proportionality factor. If,\nhowever, saturation constraints are used, as they must be in a subtractivescheme, this can invalidate the results of a simpli \ufb01ed analysis based solely\non these eigenvectors (as in \ufb01gure 8.3). Nevertheless, we base our analysis\nof the Hebbian development of ocular dominance, and cortical maps ina later section on an analysis of the eigenvectors of the input correlationmatrix. We present simulation results to verify that this analysis is notinvalidated by the constraints imposed in the full models.\nPrincipal Component Projection\nIf applied for a long enough time, both the basic Hebb rule (equation 8.3)\nand the Oja rule (equation 8.16) generate weight vectors that are parallel tothe principal eigenvector of the correlation matrix of the inputs used dur-ing training. Figure 8.4A provides a geometric picture of the signi \ufb01cance\nof this result. In this example, the basic Hebb rule was applied to a unitdescribed by equation 8.2 with two inputs ( N\nu=2). The constraint of pos-\nitive uandvhas been dropped to simplify the discussion. The inputs used\nduring the training period were chosen from a two-dimensional Gaussiandistribution with unequal variances, resulting in the elliptical distributionof points seen in the \ufb01gure. The initial weight vector w\n(0)was chosen ran-\ndomly. The two-dimensional weight vector produced by a Hebbian rule isproportional to the principal eigenvector of the input correlation matrix.The line in \ufb01gure 8.4A indicates the direction along which the \ufb01nalwlies,\nwith the u\n1and u2axes used to represent w1andw2as well. The weight\nvector points in the direction along which the cloud of input points has thelargest variance, a result with interesting implications.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Intuition suggests, and a technique known as principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) formalizes, that this projection is often the op- PCA principal\ncomponent analysis timal choice if a set of vectors is to be represented by, and reconstructed\nfrom, a set of single numbers. An information theoretic interpretation ofthis projection direction is also possible. The entropy of a Gaussian dis-tributed random variable with variance\n\u03c32grows with increasing variance\nas log2\u03c3. If the input statistics and output noise are Gaussian, maximizing\nthe variance of vby a Hebbian rule thus maximizes the amount of infor-\nmation vcarries about u. In chapter 10, we further consider the compu-\ntational signi \ufb01cance of \ufb01nding the direction of maximum variance in the\ninput data set, and we discuss the relationship between this and generaltechniques for extracting structure from input statistics.\nFigure 8.4B shows the consequence of applying correlational Hebbian\nplasticity when the average activities of the inputs are not zero, as is in-evitable if real \ufb01ring rates are employed. In this example, correlation-\nbased Hebbian modi \ufb01cation aligns the weight vector parallel to a line\nfrom the origin to the point\n/angbracketleftu/angbracketright. This clearly fails to capture the essence\nof the distribution of inputs. Figure 8.4C shows the result of applying acovariance-based Hebbian modi \ufb01cation instead.

This is especially true for neurons in layer ocular dominance\n4, which receives extensive innervation from the LGN. Neurons domi-nated by one eye or the other occupy different patches of cortex, and ar-eas with left- or right-eye ocular dominance alternate across the cortex infairly regular bands, forming a cortical map. The patterns of connections cortical map\nthat give rise to neuronal selectivities and cortical maps are establishedduring development by both activity-independent and activity-dependentprocesses. A conventional view is that activity-independent mechanismscontrol the initial targeting of axons, determine the appropriate layer forthem to innervate, and establish a coarse topographic order in their pro-jections. Other activity-independent and activity-dependent mechanismsthen re \ufb01ne this order and help to create and preserve neuronal selectivi-\nties and cortical maps. Although the relative roles of activity-independentand activity-dependent processes in cortical development are the subjectof extensive debate, developmental models based on activity-dependentplasticity rules have played an important role in suggesting key experi-ments and successfully predicting their outcomes. A detailed analysis ofthe more complex pattern-forming models that have been proposed is be-yond the scope of this book. Instead, in this and later sections, we givea brief overview of the different approaches and results that have beenobtained.\nAs an example of a developmental model of ocular dominance at the sin-\ngle neuron level, we consider the highly simpli \ufb01ed case of a layer 4 cell\nthat receives input from just two LGN afferents. One afferent is associ-ated with the right eye and has activity u\nR, and the other is from the left\neye with activity uL. Two synaptic weights w=(wR,wL)describe the\nstrengths of these projections, and the output activity vis determined by\nequation 8.2,\nv=wRuR+wLuL. (8.24)\nThe weights in this model are constrained to non-negative values. Initially,\nthe weights for the right- and left-eye inputs are set to approximately equalvalues. Ocular dominance arises when one of the weights is pushed tozero while the other remains positive.\nWe can estimate the results of a Hebbian developmental process by con-\nsidering the input correlation matrix. We assume that the two eyes areequivalent, so the correlation matrix of the right- and left-eye inputs takesthe form\nQ\n=/angbracketleftuu/angbracketright=/parenleftbigg/angbracketleftuRuR/angbracketright/angbracketleftuRuL/angbracketright\n/angbracketleftuLuR/angbracketright/angbracketleftuLuL/angbracketright/parenrightbigg\n=/parenleftbiggqSqD\nqDqS/parenrightbigg\n. (8.25)\nThe subscripts Sand Ddenote same- and different-eye correlations. The\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(8.26)\nPositive correlations between the two eyes are likely to exist ( qD>0) af-\nter eye opening has occurred. This means that qS+qD>qS\u2212qD, so, ac-\ncording to equations 8.26, w+grows more rapidly than w\u2212. Equivalently,\ne1=(1,1)/\u221a\n2 is the principal eigenvector. The basic Hebbian rule thus\npredicts a \ufb01nal weight vector proportional to e1, which implies equal in-\nnervation from both eyes. This is not the observed outcome.\nFigure 8.3 suggests that, for some initial weight con \ufb01gurations, satura-\ntion could ensure that the \ufb01nal con \ufb01guration of weights is (wmax,0)or\n(0,wmax),r e\ufb02ecting ocular dominance, rather than (wmax,wmax)as the\neigenvector analysis would suggest. However, this result would requirethe initial weights to be substantially unequal. To obtain a more ro-bust prediction of ocular dominance, we can use the Hebbian rule withsubtractive normalization, equation 8.14. This completely eliminates thegrowth of the weight vector in the direction of e\n1(i.e. the increase of\nw+) because, in this case, e1is proportional to n. On the other hand,\nit has no effect on growth in the direction e2(i.e. the growth of w\u2212)b e -\ncause e2\u00b7n=0. Thus, with subtractive normalization, the weight vector\ngrows parallel (or anti-parallel) to the direction e2=(1,\u22121)/\u221a\n2. The di-\nrection of this growth depends on initial conditions through the value of\nw(0)\u00b7e2=(wR(0)\u2212wL(0))/\u221a\n2. If this is positive, wRwill increase and\nwLwill decrease, and if it is negative wLwill increase and wRwill de-\ncrease. Eventually, the decreasing weight will hit the saturation limit ofzero, and the other weight will stop increasing due to the normalizationconstraint. At this point, total dominance by one eye or the other has beenachieved. This simple model shows that ocular dominance can arise fromHebbian plasticity if there is suf \ufb01cient competition between the growth of\nthe left- and right-eye weights.\nHebbian Development of Orientation Selectivity\nHebbian models can also account for the development of the orientation\nselectivity displayed by neurons in primary visual cortex. The model ofHubel and Wiesel for generating an orientation-selective simple cell re-sponse by summing linear arrays of alternating ON and OFF LGN inputswas presented in chapter 2. The necessary pattern of LGN inputs can arisefrom Hebbian plasticity on the basis of correlations between the responsesof different LGN cells and competition between ON and OFF units. Such\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Plasticity and Learning\nFigure 8.5: Different cortical receptive \ufb01elds arising from a correlation-based de-\nvelopmental model. White and black regions correspond to areas in the visual \ufb01eld\nwhere ON-center cells (white regions) or OFF-center (black regions) LGN cells ex-cite the cortical neuron being modeled. (Adapted from Miller, 1994.)\na model can be constructed by considering a simple cell receiving input\nfrom ON-center and OFF-center cells of the LGN and applying Hebbianplasticity, subject to appropriate constraints, to the feedforward weights ofthe model.\nAs in the case of ocular dominance, the development of orientation selec-\ntivity can be analyzed on the basis of properties of the correlation matrixdriving Hebbian development. However, constraints must be taken intoaccount and, in this case, the nonlinearities introduced by the constraintsplay a signi \ufb01cant role. For this reason, we do not analyze this model math-\nematically, but simply present simulation results.\nNeurons in primary visual cortex only receive afferents from LGN cells\ncentered over a \ufb01nite region of the visual space. This anatomical con-\nstraint can be included in developmental models by introducing what iscalled an arbor function. The arbor function, which is often taken to be arbor function\nGaussian, characterizes the density of innervation from different visual lo-cations to the cell being modeled. As a simpli \ufb01cation, this density is not al-\ntered during the Hebbian developmental process, but that the strengths ofsynapses within the arbor are modi \ufb01ed by the Hebbian rule. The outcome\nis oriented receptive \ufb01elds of a limited spatial extent. Figure 8.5 shows the\nweights resulting from a simulation of receptive- \ufb01eld development using\na large array of ON- and OFF-center LGN afferents. This illustrates a vari-ety of oriented receptive \ufb01eld structures that can arise through a Hebbian\ndevelopmental rule.\nTemporal Hebbian Rules and Trace Learning\nTemporal Hebbian rules exhibit a phenomenon called trace learning, be- trace learning\ncause the changes to a synapse depend on a history or trace of the pastactivity across the synapse. Integrating equation 8.18 from t\n=0 to a large\n\ufb01nal time t=T, assuming that w=0 initially, and shifting the integration\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.3 Unsupervised Learning 21\nvariable, we can approximate the \ufb01nal result of this temporal plasticity\nrule as\nw=1\n\u03c4w/integraldisplayT\n0dtv(t)/integraldisplay\u221e\n\u2212\u221ed\u03c4H(\u03c4)u(t\u2212\u03c4). (8.27)\nThe approximation comes from ignoring both small contributions asso-\nciated with the end points of the integral and the change in vproduced\nduring training by the modi \ufb01cation of w. Equation 8.27 shows that tem-\nporally dependent Hebbian plasticity depends on the correlation betweenthe postsynaptic activity and the presynaptic activity temporally \ufb01ltered\nby the function H.\nEquation 8.27 (with a suitably chosen H) can be used to model the de-\nvelopment of invariant responses. Neurons in infero-temporal cortex, forexample, can respond selectively to particular objects independent of theirlocation within a wide receptive \ufb01eld. The idea underlying the application\nof equation 8.27 is that objects persist in the visual environment for char-acteristic lengths of time, while moving across the retina. If the plastic-ity rule in equation 8.27 \ufb01lters presynaptic activity over this characteristic\ntime scale, it tends to strengthen the synapses from the presynaptic unitsthat are active for all the positions adopted by the object while it persists.As a result, the response of the postsynaptic cell comes to be independentof the position of the object, and position-invariant responses are gener-ated.\nMultiple Postsynaptic Neurons\nTo study the effect of plasticity on multiple neurons, we introduce thenetwork of \ufb01gure 8.6 in which N\nvoutput neurons receive input from Nu\nfeedforward connections and from recurrent interconnections. A vector v\nrepresents the activities of the multiple output units, and the feedforwardsynaptic connections are described by a matrix Wwith the element W\nab Wfeedforward\nweight matrix giving the strength and sign of the synapse from input unit bto output\nunit a.\nIt is important that different output neurons in a multi-unit network be\nselective for different aspects of the input, or else their responses will becompletely redundant. For the case of a single cell, competition betweendifferent synapses could be used to ensure that synapse-speci \ufb01c plasticity\nrules did not make the same modi \ufb01cations to all of the synapses onto a\npostsynaptic neuron. For multiple output networks, \ufb01xed or plastic linear\nor nonlinear recurrent interactions can be used to ensure that the units donot all develop the same selectivity.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n22 Plasticity and Learning\noutput v\ninput uWM\nu1 u2 u3 uNu\nFigure 8.6: A network with multiple output units driven by feedforward synapses\nwith weights W, and interconnected by recurrent synapses with weights M.\nFixed Linear Recurrent Connections\nWe\ufb01rst consider the case of linear recurrent connections from output cell a/prime\nto output cell adescribed by element Maa/primeof the matrix M.A si nc h a p t e r7 , Mrecurrent\nweight matrix the output activity is determined by\n\u03c4rdv\ndt=\u2212v+W\u00b7u+M\u00b7v.

The lower panel shows the pattern of innervation for a 512 unit model afterHebbian development. White and black regions denote units dominated by right-and left-eye projections respectively. (B data of S LeVay adapted from Nicholls etal. 1992.)\nWe consider a highly simpli \ufb01ed model of the development of ocular domi-\nnance maps including only a single direction across the cortex and a singlepoint in the visual \ufb01eld. Figure 8.7A shows the simpli \ufb01ed model, which\nhas only two input activities, u\nRand uL, with the correlation matrix of\nequation 8.25, connected to multiple output units through weight vectorsw\nRand wL.

This means\nthat all the input and output units have equivalent neighbors, a reasonablemodel of a patch of the cortex away from regional boundaries. Actually,edge effects can impose important constraints on the overall structure ofmaps such as that of ocular dominance stripes, but we do not analyze thishere.

In this simulation, constraints that limit the growth of synapticweights have been included, but these do not dramatically alter the con-clusions of our analysis.\nCompetitive Hebbian Learning\nLinear recurrent connections can only produce a limited amount of differ-\nentiation among network neurons, because they only induce fairly weakcompetition between output units. As detailed in chapter 7, recurrentconnections can lead to much stronger competition if the interactions arenonlinear. nonlinear\ncompetitionOne form of nonlinear competition represents the effect of cortical process-\ning in two somewhat abstract stages. One stage, modeling the effects oflong-range inhibition, involves competition among all the cortical cells forfeedforward input in a scheme related to that used in chapter 2 for contrastsaturation. The second stage, modeling shorter range excitation, involvescooperation in which neurons that receive feedforward input excite theirneighbors.\nIn the \ufb01rst stage, the feedforward input for unit a, and that for all the other\nunits, is fed through a nonlinear function to generate a competitive mea-sure of the local excitation generated at location a,\nz\na=/parenleftbig/summationtext\nbWabub/parenrightbig\u03b4\n/summationtext\na/prime/parenleftbig/summationtext\nbWa/primebub/parenrightbig\u03b4. (8.34)\nThe activities and weights are all assumed to be positive. The parameter\n\u03b4controls the degree of competition among units. For large \u03b4, only the\nlargest feedforward input survives. The case of \u03b4=1 is closely related to\nthe linear recurrent connections of the previous section.\nIn the cooperative stage, the local excitation of equation 8.34 is distributed\nacross the cortex by the recurrent connections, so that the \ufb01nal level of\nactivity in unit ais\nva=/summationdisplay\na/primeMaa/primeza/prime. (8.35)\nThis ensures that the localized excitation characterized by zais spread\nacross a local neighborhood of the cortex, rather than being concentratedentirely at location a. In this scheme, the recurrent connections are usually\npurely excitatory and fairly short-range, because the effect of longer rangeinhibition has been modeled by the competition.\nUsing the outputs of equation 8.35 in conjunction with a Hebbian rule for\nthe feedforward weights is called competitive Hebbian learning. The com- competitive\nHebbian learning\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Plasticity and Learning\nleft input bright input binput bL       Routput a\noutput a\noutput aAB C/CFL\n/CFR\n/CFR\n/A0 /CFL\nFigure 8.9: Ocular dominance patterns from a competitive Hebbian model.

The model used\nhere has 100 input units for each eye and for the output layer, and a coarse initialtopography was assumed. Circular (toroidal) boundary conditions were imposedto avoid edge effects. The input activity patterns during training represented sin-gle Gaussian illuminations in both eyes centered on a randomly chosen input unit\nb, with a larger magnitude for one eye (chosen randomly) than for the other. The\nrecurrent weights Mtook the form of a Gaussian.\npetition between neurons implemented by this scheme does not ensure\ncompetition among the synapses onto a given neuron, so some mechanismsuch as a normalization constraint is still required. Most importantly, theoutcome of training cannot be analyzed simply by considering eigenvec-tors of the covariance or correlation matrix because the activation processis nonlinear. Rather, higher-order statistics of the input distribution areimportant. Nonlinear competition can lead to differentiation of the outputunits and the removal of redundancy beyond the second order.\nAn example of the use of competitive Hebbian learning is shown in \ufb01g-\nure 8.9, in the form of a one-dimensional cortical map of ocular domi-nance with inputs arising from LGN neurons with receptive \ufb01elds cover-\ning an extended region of the visual \ufb01eld (rather than the single location\nof our simpler model). This example uses competitive Hebbian plastic-ity with non-dynamic multiplicative weight normalization. Two weightmatrices, W\nRand WL, corresponding to right- and left-eye inputs, char-\nacterize the connectivity of the model. These are shown separately in \ufb01g-\nure 8.9A, which illustrates that the cortical cells develop retinotopicallyordered receptive \ufb01elds and segregate into alternating patches dominated\nby one eye or the other. The ocular dominance pattern is easier to seein\ufb01gure 8.9B, which shows the difference between the right- and left-eye\nweights, W\nR\u2212WL, and 8.9C which shows the net ocularity of the total\ninput to each output neuron of the model (/summationtext\nb[WR\u2212WL]ab, for each a). It\nis possible to analyze the structure shown in \ufb01gure 8.9 and reveal the pre-\ncise effect of the competition (i.e. the effect of changing the competition\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.3 Unsupervised Learning 27\nparameter \u03b4in equation 8.34). Such an analysis shows, for example, that\nsubtractive normalization of the synaptic weight is not necessary to ensurethe robust development of ocular dominance as it is in the non-competitivecase.\nFeature-Based ModelsModels of cortical map formation can get extremely complex when mul-\ntiple neuronal selectivities such as retinotopic location, ocular dominanceand orientation preference are considered simultaneously. To deal withthis, a class of more abstract models, called competitive feature-basedmodels, has been developed. These use a general approach similar to feature-based\nmodels the competitive Hebbian models discussed in the previous section. These\nmodels are further from the biophysical reality of neuronal \ufb01ring rates and\nsynaptic strengths, but they provide a compact description of map devel-opment.\nFeature-based models characterize neurons and their inputs by their se-\nlectivities rather than by their synaptic weights. The idea, evident from\ufb01gure 8.9, is that the receptive \ufb01eld of cortical cell afor the weights shown\nin\ufb01gure 8.9A (at the end point of development) can be characterized by\njust two numbers. One, the ocularity,\n\u03b6a, is shown in the right hand plot\nof\ufb01gure 8.9C, and is the summed difference of the connections from the\nleft and right eyes to cortical unit a. The other, xa, is the mean topographic\nlocation in the input of cell a. For many developmental models, the stim-\nuli used during training, although involving the activities of a whole setof input units, can also be characterized abstractly using the same smallnumber of feature parameters.\nThe matrix element W\nabin a feature-based model is equal to the variable\ncharacterizing the selectivity on neuron ato the feature parameter b. Thus,\nin a one-dimensional model of topography and ocular dominance, Wa1=\nxa,Wa2=\u03b6a. Similarly, the inputs are considered in terms of the same\nfeature parameters and are expressed as u=(x,\u03b6).Nuis equal to the\nnumber of parameters being used to characterize the stimulus (here, Nu=\n2). In the case of \ufb01gure 8.9, the inputs are drawn from a distribution in\nwhich xis chosen randomly between 1 and 100, and \u03b6takes a \ufb01xed positive\nor negative value with equal probability. The description of the model iscompleted by specifying the feature-based equivalent of how a particularinput activates the cortical cells, and how this leads to plasticity in thefeature-based weights W.\nThe response of a selective neuron depends on how closely the stimulus\nmatches the characteristics of its preferred stimulus. The weights W\nabde-\ntermine the preferred stimulus features, and thus we assume that the ac-tivation of neuron ais high if the components of the input u\nbmatch the\ncomponents of Wab. A convenient way to achieve this is to express the\nactivation for unit aas exp (\u2212/summationtext\nb(ub\u2212Wab)2/(2\u03c32\nb)), which has its max-\nimum at ub=Wabfor all b, and falls off as a Gaussian function for less\nperfect matches of the stimulus to the selectivity of the cell. The param-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Plasticity and Learning\neter\u03c3bdetermines how selective the neuron is to characteristic bof the\nstimulus.\nThe Gaussian expression for the activation of neuron ais not used directly\nto determine its level of activity. Rather, as in the case of competitive Heb-bian learning, we introduce a competitive activity variable for cortical site\na,\nz\na=exp/parenleftbig\u2212/summationtext\nb(ub\u2212Wab)2/(2\u03c32\nb)/parenrightbig\n/summationtext\na/primeexp/parenleftbig\u2212/summationtext\nb(ub\u2212Wa/primeb)2/(2\u03c32\nb)/parenrightbig. (8.36)\nIn addition, some cooperative mechanism must be included to keep the\nmaps smooth, which means that nearby neurons should, as far as possi-ble, have similar selectivities. The two algorithms we discuss, the self-organizing map and the elastic net, differ in how they introduce this sec-ond element.\nThe self-organizing map spreads the activity de \ufb01ned by equation 8.36 to self-organizing map\nnearby cortical sites through equation 8.35,\nva=/summationtext\na/primeMaa/primeza/prime. This gives\ncortical cells aand a/primesimilar selectivities if they are nearby, because vaand\nva/primeare related through local recurrent connections. Hebbian development\nof the selectivities characterized by Wis then generated by an activity de-\npendent rule. In general, Hebbian plasticity adjusts the weights of acti-vated units so that they become more responsive to and selective for theinput patterns that excite them. Feature-based models achieve the samething by modifying the selectivities W\nabso they more closely match the\ninput parameters ubwhen output unit ais activated by u. In the case of\nthe self-organized map, this is achieved through the averaged rule feature-based\nlearning rule\n\u03c4wdW ab\ndt=/angbracketleftva(ub\u2212Wab)/angbracketright. (8.37)\nThe other feature-based algorithm, the elastic net, sets the activity of unit elastic net\nato the result of equation 8.36, va=za, which generates competition.\nSmoothness of the map is ensured not by spreading this activity, as in theself-organizing map, but by including an additional term in the plastic-ity rule that tends to make nearby selectivities the same. The elastic netmodi \ufb01cation rule is elastic net rule\n\u03c4wdW ab\ndt=/angbracketleftva(ub\u2212Wab)/angbracketright+\u03b2/summationdisplay\na/primeneighbor of a(Wa/primeb\u2212Wab) (8.38)\nwhere the sum is over all points a/primethat are neighbors of a, and\u03b2is a pa-\nrameter that controls the degree of smoothness in the map. The elastic netmakes W\nabsimilar to Wa/primeb,i faand a/primeare nearby on the cortex, by reducing\n(Wa/primeb\u2212Wab)2.\nFigure 8.10A shows the results of an optical imaging experiment that re-\nveals how ocularity and orientation selectivity are arranged across a re-gion of the primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey.

They also show howthese neighborhoods are arranged with respect to each other and withrespect to the ocular dominance stripes. There are singularities, calledpinwheels, in the orientation map where regions with different orienta-tion preferences meet at a point. These tend to occur near the centers ofthe ocular dominance stripes. There are also linear zones where the iso-orientation domains run parallel to each other. These tend to occur at, andrun perpendicular to, the boundaries of the ocular dominance stripes.\nFigure 8.10B shows the result of an elastic net model plotted in the\nsame form as the macaque map of \ufb01gure 8.10A.

The self-organizing map can produce almost identical results, andnon-competitive and competitive Hebbian developmental algorithms canalso lead to structures like this.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n30 Plasticity and Learning\nAnti-Hebbian Modi \ufb01cation\nWe previously alluded to the problem of redundancy among multiple out-\nput neurons that can arise from feedforward Hebbian modi \ufb01cation. The\nOja rule of equation 8.16 for multiple output units, which takes the form\n\u03c4wdW ab\ndt=vaub\u2212\u03b1v2\naWab, (8.39)\nprovides a good illustration of this problem. In the absence of recurrent\nconnections, this rule sets each row of the feedforward weight matrix tothe principal eigenvector of the input correlation matrix, making each out-put unit respond identically.\nOne way to reduce redundancy in a linear model is to make the linear\nrecurrent interactions of equation 8.29 plastic rather than \ufb01xed, using an plastic recurrent\nsynapses anti-Hebbian modi \ufb01cation rule. As the name implies, anti-Hebbian plas-\nanti-Hebbian\nplasticityticity causes synapses to decrease (rather than increase) in strength when\nthere is simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic activity. The recurrent interac-tions arising from an anti-Hebbian rule can prevent the output units fromrepresenting the same eigenvector. This occurs because the recurrent inter-actions tend to make the different output units less correlated by cancelingthe effects of common feedforward input. Anti-Hebbian modi \ufb01cation is\nbelieved to be the predominant form of plasticity at synapses from paral-lel\ufb01bers to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, although this may be a special\ncase because Purkinje cells inhibit rather than excite their targets. A basicanti-Hebbian rule for M\naa/primecan be created simply by changing the sign on\nthe right side of equation 8.3. However, just as Hebbian plasticity tends tomake weights increase without bound, anti-Hebbian modi \ufb01cation tends\nto make them decrease, and for reasons of stability, it is necessary to use\n\u03c4MdM\ndt=\u2212vv+\u03b2M or\u03c4MdM aa/prime\ndt=\u2212vava/prime+\u03b2Maa/prime (8.40)\nto modify the off-diagonal components of M(the diagonal components\nare de \ufb01ned to be zero). Here, \u03b2is a positive constant. For suitably chosen\n\u03b2and\u03c4M, the combination of rules 8.39 and 8.40 produces a stable con \ufb01gu-\nration in which the rows of the weight matrix Ware different eigenvectors\nof the correlation matrix Q, and all the elements of the recurrent weight\nmatrix Mare zero.\nGoodall (1960) proposed an alternative scheme for decorrelating different\noutput units. In his model, the feedforward weights Ware kept constant,\nwhile the recurrent weights adapt according to the anti-Hebbian rule Goodall rule\n\u03c4MdM\ndt=\u2212(W\u00b7u)v+I\u2212M (8.41)\nThe minus sign in the term \u2212(W\u00b7u)vembodies the anti-Hebbian modi \ufb01-\ncation. This term is non-local, because the change in the weight of a given\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.3 Unsupervised Learning 31\nsynapse depends on the total feedforward input to the postsynaptic neu-\nron, not merely on the input at that particular synapse (recall that v/negationslash=W\u00b7u\nin this case because of the recurrent connections). The term I\u2212Mprevents\nthe weights from going to zero by forcing them toward the identity matrixI. Unlike 8.40, this rule requires the existence of autapses, synapses that a\nneuron makes onto itself (i.e. the diagonal elements of Mare not zero).\nIf the Goodall plasticity rule converges and stops changing M, the right\nside of equation 8.41 must vanish on average, which requires (using thede\ufb01nition of K)\n/angbracketleft(W\u00b7u)v/angbracketright=I\u2212M=K\u22121. (8.42)\nMultiplying both sides by Kwe\ufb01nd, using equation 8.30,\n/angbracketleft(K\u00b7W\u00b7u)v/angbracketright=/angbracketleft vv/angbracketright=I. (8.43)\nThis means that the outputs are decorrelated and also indicates histogram\nequalization in the sense, discussed in chapter 4, that all the elements of v\nhave the same variance. Indeed, the Goodall algorithm can be used to im-plement the decorrelation and whitening discussed in chapter 4. Becausethe anti-Hebbian and Goodall rules are based on linear models, they areonly capable of removing second-order redundancy, meaning redundancycharacterized by the covariance matrix. In chapter 10, we consider modelsthat are based on eliminating higher orders of redundancy as well.\nTiming-Based Plasticity and Prediction\nTemporal Hebbian rules have been used in the context of multi-unit net-\nworks to store information about temporal sequences. To illustrate this,we consider a network with the architecture of \ufb01gure 8.6. We study the\neffect of time-dependent synaptic plasticity, as given by equation 8.18, onthe recurrent synapses of the model, leaving the feedforward synapsesconstant. Suppose that, before training, the average response of outputunit ato a stimulus characterized by a parameter sis given by the tuning\ncurve f\na(s), which reaches its maximum for the optimal stimulus s=sa.\nDifferent neurons have different optimal stimulus values, as depicted bythe dashed and thin solid curves in \ufb01gure 8.11A. We now examine what\nhappens when the plasticity rule 8.18 is applied throughout a training pe-riod during which the stimulus being presented is an increasing functionof time. Such a stimulus excites the different neurons in the network se-quentially. For example, the neuron with s\na=\u2212 2 is active before the neu-\nron with sa=0, which in turn is active before the neuron with sa=2. If\nthe stimulus changes rapidly enough, the interval between the \ufb01ring of\nthe neuron with sa=\u2212 2 and that with sa=0 will fall within the win-\nd o wf o rL T Pd e p i c t e di n \ufb01gure 8.2B. This means that a synapse from the\nneuron with sa=\u2212 2t ot h e sa=0 neuron will be strengthened. On the\nother hand, because the neuron with sa=2\ufb01res after the sa=0 neuron, a\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n32 Plasticity and Learning\nA\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n-4 -2 0 24\nsv\n05 1015\nlap number4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n-2place field  location  (cm)B\nFigure 8.11: A) Predicted and experimental shift of place \ufb01elds. A) Shift in a neu-\nronal \ufb01ring-rate tuning curve caused by repeated exposure to a time-dependent\nstimulus during training. The dashed curves and thin solid curve indicate theinitial response tuning curves of a network of interconnected neurons. The thicksolid curve is the response tuning curve of the neuron that initially had the thinsolid tuning curve after a training period involving a time-dependent stimulus.The tuning curve increased in amplitude, broadened, and shifted as a result oftemporally asymmetric Hebbian plasticity. The shift shown corresponds to a stim-ulus with a positive rate of change, that is, one that moved rightward on this plotas a function of time. The corresponding shift in the tuning curve is to the left. Theshift has been calculated using more neurons and tuning curves than are shownin this plot. B) Location of place \ufb01eld centers while a rat traversed laps around a\nclosed track (zero is de \ufb01ned as the average center location across the whole exper-\niment).

(B from Mehta et al., 1997.)\nsynapse from it to the sa=0 neuron will be weakened by the temporally\nasymmetric plasticity rule of equation 8.18.\nThe effect of this type of modi \ufb01cation on the tuning curve in the middle of\nthe array (the thin solid curve in \ufb01gure 8.11A centered at s=0) is shown\nby the thick solid curve in \ufb01gure 8.11A. After the training period, the neu-\nron with sa=0 receives strengthened input from the sa=\u2212 2 neuron and\nweakened input from the neuron with sa=2. This broadens and shifts the\ntuning curve of the neuron with sa=0 to lower stimulus values. The left-\nward shift seen in \ufb01gure 8.11A is a result of the temporal character of the\nplasticity rule and the temporal evolution of the stimulus during training.Note that the shift is in the direction opposite to the motion of the stimu-lus during training. This backward shift has an interesting interpretation.If the same time-dependent stimulus is presented again after training, theneuron with s\na=0 will respond earlier than it did prior to training. The\nresponses of other neurons will shift in a similar manner; we just chose theneuron with s\na=0 as a representative example. Thus, the training experi-\nence causes neurons to develop responses that predict the behavior of thestimulus.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.4 Supervised Learning 33\nEnlargements and backward shifts of neural response tuning curves simi-\nlar to those predicted from temporally asymmetric LTP and LTD inductionhave been seen in recordings of hippocampal place cells in rats. Figure8.11B shows the average location of place \ufb01elds recorded while a rat ran\nrepeated laps around a closed track. Over time, the place \ufb01eld shifted\nbackward along the track relative to the direction the rat moved.\n8.4 Supervised Learning\nIn unsupervised learning, inputs are imposed during a training period,and the output is determined by the network dynamics using the currentvalues of the weights. This means that the network and plasticity rulemust uncover patterns and regularities in the input data (such as the di-rection of maximal variance) by themselves. In supervised learning, botha set of inputs and the corresponding desired outputs are imposed duringtraining, so the network is essentially given the answer.\nTwo basic problems addressed in supervised learning are storage, which\nmeans learning the relationship between the input and output patternsprovided during training, and generalization, which means being able toprovide appropriate outputs for inputs that were not presented duringtraining, but are similar to those that were. The main task we considerwithin the context of supervised learning is function approximation (orregression), in which the output of a network unit is trained to approxi-mate a speci \ufb01ed function of the input. We also consider classi \ufb01cation of\ninputs into two categories. Understanding generalization in such settingshas been a major focus of theoretical investigations in statistics and com-puter science but lies outside the scope of our discussion.\nSupervised Hebbian Learning\nIn supervised learning, a set of paired inputs and output samples, umand\nvmform=1...NS, is presented during training. For a feedforward net-\nwork, an averaged Hebbian plasticity rule for supervised learning can beobtained from equation 8.4 by averaging across all the input-output pairs,\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=/angbracketleftvu/angbracketright=1\nNSNS/summationdisplay\nm=1vmum. (8.44)\nNote that this is similar to the unsupervised Hebbian learning case, except\nthat the output vmis imposed on the network rather than being deter-\nmined by it. This has the consequence that the input-input correlation isreplaced by the input-output cross-correlation\n/angbracketleftvu/angbracketright. cross-correlation\nUnless the cross-correlation is zero, equation 8.44 never stops changing\nthe synaptic weights. The methods introduced to stabilize Hebbian modi-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Plasticity and Learning\n\ufb01cation in the case of unsupervised learning can be applied to supervised\nlearning as well. However, stabilization is easier in the supervised case,because the right side of equation 8.44 does not depend on w. Therefore,\nthe growth is only linear, rather than exponential, in time, making a sim-ple multiplicative synaptic weight decay term suf \ufb01cient for stability. This\nis introduced by writing the supervised learning rule as supervised learning\nwith decay\n\u03c4wdw\ndt=/angbracketleftvu/angbracketright\u2212\u03b1w, (8.45)\nfor some positive constant \u03b1. Asymptotically, equation 8.45 makes w=\n/angbracketleftvu/angbracketright/\u03b1, that is, the weights become proportional to the input-output cross-\ncorrelation.\nWe have discussed supervised Hebbian learning in the case of a single out-\nput unit, but the results can obviously be generalized to multiple outputsas well.\nClassi \ufb01cation and The Perceptron\nThe perceptron is a nonlinear map that classi \ufb01es inputs into one of two perceptron\ncategories. It thus acts as a binary classi \ufb01er. To make the model consistentbinary classi \ufb01er\nwhen units are connected together in a network, we also require the in-\nputs to be binary. We can think of the two possible states as representingunits that are either active or inactive. As such, we would naturally assignthem the values 1 and 0. However, the analysis is simpler while producingsimilar results if, instead, we require the inputs u\naand output vto take the\ntwo values +1 and \u22121.\nThe output of the perceptron is based on a modi \ufb01cation of the linear rule\nof equation 8.2 to\nv=/braceleftbigg+1i f w\u00b7u\u2212\u03b3\u22650\n\u22121i f w\u00b7u\u2212\u03b3< 0.(8.46)\nThe threshold \u03b3thus determines the dividing line between values of w\u00b7u\nthat generate +1 and \u22121 outputs. The supervised learning task for the\nperceptron is to place each of NSinput patterns uminto one of two classes\ndesignated by the binary output vm. How well the perceptron performs\nthis task depends on the nature of the classi \ufb01cation. The weight vector and\nthreshold de \ufb01ne a subspace (called a hyperplane) of dimension Nu\u22121( t h e\nsubspace perpendicular to w) that cuts the Nu-dimensional space of input\nvectors into two regions. It is only possible for a perceptron to classifyinputs perfectly if a hyperplane exists that divides the input space into onehalf-space containing all the inputs corresponding to\nv=+1, and another\nhalf-space containing all those for v=\u2212 1. This condition is called linear\nseparability. An instructive case to consider is when each component of linear separability\neach input vector and the associated output values are chosen randomlyand independently with equal probabilities of being\n+1 and \u22121.

However, this does not mean that a Hebbianmodi \ufb01cation rule can construct such weights. A Hebbian rule based on\nequation 8.45 with\n\u03b1=Nu/NSconstructs the weight vector\nw=1\nNuNS/summationdisplay\nm=1vmum. (8.47)\nTo see how well such weights allow the perceptron to perform, we com-\npute the output generated by one input vector, un, chosen from the train-\ning set. For this example, we set \u03b3=0. Nonzero threshold values are\nconsidered later in the chapter.\nWith\u03b3=0, the value of vfor input unis determined solely by the sign of\nw\u00b7un.

(8.49)\nSubstituting this expression into equation 8.46 to determine the output of\nthe perceptron for the input un, we see that the term \u03b7nacts as a source of\nnoise, interfering with the ability of the perceptron to generate the correctanswer\nv=vn.\nWe can think of \u03b7nas a sample drawn from a probability distribution of \u03b7\nvalues. Consider the case when all the components of umandvmfor all m\nare chosen randomly with equal probabilities of being +1o r\u22121. Including\nthe dot product, the right side of the expression Nu\u03b7n=/summationtext\nm/negationslash=nvmum\u00b7un\nthat de \ufb01nes\u03b7nis the sum of (NS\u22121)Nuterms, each of which is equally\nlikely to be either +1o r\u22121. For large Nuand NS, the central limit theorem\n(see the Mathematical Appendix) tells us that the distribution of \u03b7values is\nGaussian with zero mean and variance (NS\u22121)/Nu. This suggests that the\nperceptron with Hebbian weights should work well if the number of inputpatterns being learned is signi \ufb01cantly less than the number of input vector\ncomponents. We can make this more precise by noting from equations 8.46with\n\u03b3=0 and equation 8.49 that, for vn=+1, the perceptron will give the\ncorrect answer if \u22121<\u03b7n<\u221e. Similarly, for vn=\u22121, the perceptron will\ngive the correct answer if \u2212\u221e<\u03b7n<1.

(8.50)\nThis result is plotted in \ufb01gure 8.12, which shows that the Hebbian percep-\ntron performs fairly well if NS\u22121 is less than about 0 .2Nu. It is possible for\nthe perceptron to perform considerably better than this if a non-Hebbianweight vector is used. We return to this in a later section.\nFunction Approximation\nIn chapter 1, we studied examples in which the \ufb01ring rate of a neuron was\ngiven by a function of a stimulus parameter, namely the response tuningcurve. When such a relationship exists, we can think of the neuronal \ufb01r-\ning rate as representing the function. Populations of neurons (labeled byan index b\n=1,2,..., Nu) that respond to a stimulus value s,b y\ufb01ring at\naverage rates fb(s)can similarly represent an entire set of functions. How-\never, a function h(s)that is not equal to any of the single neuron tuning\ncurves can only be represented by combining the responses of a numberof units. This can be done using the network shown in \ufb01gure 8.13. The\naverage steady-state activity level of the output unit in this network, inresponse to stimulus value s, is given by equation 8.2, function\napproximation\nv(s)=w\u00b7u=w\u00b7f(s)=N/summationdisplay\nb=1wbfb(s).

The value of an input variable\nsis encoded by the activity of a population of neurons with tuning curves f(s).\nThis activity drives an output neuron through a vector of weights wto create an\noutput activity vthat approximates the function h(s).\nNote that we have replaced ubyf(s)where f(s)is the vector with compo-\nnents fb(s). The network presented in chapter 7 that performs coordinate\ntransformation is an example of this type of function approximation.\nIn equation 8.51, the input tuning curves f(s)act as a basis for representing\nthe output function h(s), and for this reason they are called basis functions. basis functions\nDifferent sets of basis functions can be used to represent a given set of out-put functions. A set of basis functions that can represent any member of aclass of functions using a linear sum, as in equation 8.51, is called completefor this class. For the sets of complete functions typically used in mathe- completeness\nmatics, such as the sines and cosines used in a Fourier series, the weights inequation 8.51 are unique. When neural tuning curves are used to expand afunction, the weights tend not to be unique, and the set of input functionsis called overcomplete. In this chapter, we assume that the basis functions overcomplete\nare held \ufb01xed, and only the weights are adjusted to improve output per-\nformance, although it is interesting to consider methods for learning thebest basis functions for a particular application. One way of doing this isby applying backpropagation, which develops the basis functions guidedby the output errors of the network. Other methods, which we consider inchapter 10, involve unsupervised learning.\nSuppose that the function-representation network of \ufb01gure 8.13 is pro-\nvided a sequence of N\nSsample stimuli smform=1,2,..., NS, and the\ncorresponding function values h(sm)during a training period. To make\nv(sm)match h(sm)as closely as possible for all m, we minimize the error\nE=1\n2NSNS/summationdisplay\nm=1/parenleftbig\nh(sm)\u2212v(sm)/parenrightbig2=1\n2/angbracketleftBig\n(h(s)\u2212w\u00b7f(s))2/angbracketrightBig\n. (8.52)\nWe have made the replacement v(s)=w\u00b7f(s)in this equation and have\nused the bracket notation for the average over the training inputs. Equa-tions for the weights that minimize this error, called the normal equations, normal equations\nare obtained by setting its derivative with respect to the weights to zero,\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n38 Plasticity and Learning\nyielding the condition\n/angbracketleftf(s)f(s)/angbracketright\u00b7w=/angbracketleftf(s)h(s)/angbracketright. (8.53)\nThe supervised Hebbian rule of equation 8.45, applied in this case, ulti-\nmately sets the weight vector to w=/angbracketleftf(s)h(s)/angbracketright/\u03b1. These weights must\nsatisfy the normal equations 8.53 if they are to optimize function approx-imation. There are two circumstances under which this occurs. The obvi-ous one is when the input units are orthogonal across the training stimuli,\n/angbracketleftf(s)f(s)/angbracketright=I. In this case, the normal equations are satis \ufb01ed with \u03b1=1.\nHowever, this condition is unlikely to hold for most sets of input tuningcurves. An alternative possibility is that, for all pairs of stimuli s\nmand sm/prime\nin the training set,\nf(sm)\u00b7f(sm/prime)=c\u03b4mm/prime (8.54)\nfor some constant c. This is called a tight frame condition. If it is satis \ufb01ed, tight frame\nthe weights given by a supervised Hebbian learning with decay can satisfythe normal equations. To see this, we insert the weights w\n=/angbracketleftf(s)h(s)/angbracketright/\u03b1\ninto equation 8.53 and use 8.54 to obtain\n/angbracketleftf(s)f(s)/angbracketright\u00b7w=/angbracketleftf(s)f(s)/angbracketright\u00b7/angbracketleftf(s)h(s)/angbracketright\n\u03b1=1\n\u03b1N2\nS/summationdisplay\nmm/primef(sm)f(sm)\u00b7f(sm/prime)h(sm/prime)\n=c\n\u03b1N2\nS/summationdisplay\nmf(sm)h(sm)=c\n\u03b1NS/angbracketleftf(s)h(s)/angbracketright. (8.55)\nThis shows that the normal equations are satis \ufb01ed for \u03b1=c/NS. Thus,\nwe have shown two ways that supervised Hebbian learning can solve thefunction approximation problem, but both require special conditions onthe basis functions f\n(s). A more general scheme, discussed below, involves\nusing an error-correcting rule.\nSupervised Error-Correcting Rules\nAn essential limitation of supervised Hebbian rules is that synaptic mod-i\ufb01cation does not depend on the actual performance of the network. An\nalternative learning strategy is to start with an initial guess for the weights,compare the output\nvin response to input umwith the desired output vm,\nand change the weights to improve the performance. Two important error-correcting modi \ufb01cation rules are the perceptron rule, which applies to bi-\nnary classi \ufb01cation, and the delta rule, which can be applied to function\napproximation and many other problems.\nThe Perceptron Learning Rule\nSuppose that the perceptron of equation 8.46 incorrectly classi \ufb01es an input\npattern u\nm. If the output is v(um)=\u2212 1w h e n vm=1, the weight vector\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n8.4 Supervised Learning 39\nshould be modi \ufb01ed to make w\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3larger. Similarly, if v(um)=1 when\nvm=\u2212 1,w\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3should be decreased. A plasticity rule that performs\nsuch an adjustment is the perceptron learning rule, perceptron\nlearning rule\nw\u2192w+/epsilon1w\n2/parenleftbigvm\u2212v(um)/parenrightbig\num\u03b3\u2192\u03b3\u2212/epsilon1w\n2(vm\u2212v(um)) (8.56)\nHere, and in subsequent sections in this chapter, we use discrete updates\nfor the weights (indicated by the \u2192) rather than the differential equations\nused up to this point. This is due to the discrete nature of the presentationof the training patterns. Here,\n/epsilon1wdetermines the modi \ufb01cation rate and is\nanalogous to 1 /\u03c4w. In equation 8.56, we have assumed that the threshold\n\u03b3is also plastic. The learning rule for \u03b3is inverted compared with that for\nthe weights, because \u03b3enters equation 8.46 with a minus sign.\nTo verify that the perceptron learning rule makes appropriate weight ad-\njustments, we note that it implies that\n/parenleftbig\nw\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3/parenrightbig\u2192/parenleftbig\nw\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3/parenrightbig+/epsilon1w\n2(vm\u2212v(um))/parenleftbig|um|2+1/parenrightbig. (8.57)\nThis result shows that if vm=1 and v(um)=\u2212 1, the weight change in-\ncreases w\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3.I fvm=\u22121 and v(um)=1,w\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3is decreased. This\nis exactly what is needed to compensate for the error. Note that the per-ceptron learning rule does not modify the weights if the output is correct.\nTo learn a set of input pattern classi \ufb01cations, the perceptron learning rule is\napplied to each one sequentially. For \ufb01xed\n/epsilon1w, the perceptron learning rule\nof equation 8.56 is guaranteed to \ufb01nd a set of weights wand threshold \u03b3\nthat solve any linearly separable problem. This is proved in the appendix.\nThe Delta Rule\nThe perceptron learning rule is designed for binary outputs. The function\napproximation task with the error function Eof equation 8.52 can also be\nsolved using an error correcting scheme. A simple but extremely usefulversion of this is the gradient descent procedure, which modi \ufb01eswac- gradient descent\ncording to\nw\n\u2192w\u2212/epsilon1w\u2207wEorwb\u2192wb\u2212/epsilon1w\u2202E\n\u2202wb(8.58)\nwhere \u2207wEis the vector with components \u2202E/\u2202w b.

We will take /epsilon1wto be small, and ignore this concern.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n40 Plasticity and Learning\n-10 0 10-1.5-1-0.500.511.5\ns-10 0 10-1.5-1-0.500.511.5\ns-10 0 10-1.5-1-0.500.511.5\nsA BC\nv\nFigure 8.14: Eleven input neurons with Gaussian tuning curves drive an out-\nput neuron to approximate a sine function.

If Ehas many min-\nima, gradient descent will \ufb01nd only one of them (a local minimum), and\nnot necessarily the one with the lowest value of E(the global minimum).\nIn the case of linear function approximation using basis functions, as inequation 8.51, gradient descent \ufb01nds a value of wthat satis \ufb01es the normal\nequations, and therefore constructs an optimal function approximator, be-cause there are no non-global minima.\nFor function approximation, the error Ein equation 8.52 is an average over\na set of examples. As for the perceptron learning rule of equation 8.56, it ispossible to present randomly chosen input output pairs s\nmand h(sm), and\nchange waccording to \u2212\u2207 w(h(sm)\u2212v(sm))2/2. Using \u2207wv=u=f, this\nproduces what is called the delta rule, delta rule\nw\u2192w+/epsilon1w(h(sm)\u2212v(sm))f(sm). (8.60)\nThe procedure of applying the delta rule to each pattern sequentially is\ncalled stochastic gradient descent, and it is particularly useful because itallows learning to take place continuously while sample inputs are pre-sented. There are more ef \ufb01cient methods of searching for minima of func-\ntions than stochastic gradient descent, but many of them are complicated stochastic gradient\ndecent to implement. The weights wwill typically not completely settle down to\n\ufb01xed values during the training period for a \ufb01xed value of\n/epsilon1w. However,\ntheir averages will tend to satisfy the normal equations.\nFigure 8.14 shows the result of modifying an initially random set of\nweights using the delta rule. Ultimately, an array of input neurons with\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The difference between \ufb01gures 8.14B and C illus-\ntrates the difference between storage and generalization. Figure 8.14B isbased on 20 pairs of training inputs and outputs, while \ufb01gure 8.14C in-\nvolves 100 pairs. It is clear that\nv(s)in\ufb01gure 8.14B does not match the\nsine function very well, at least for values of sthat were not in the training\nset, while v(s)in\ufb01gure 8.14C provides a good approximation of the sine\nfunction for all svalues. The ability of the network to approximate the\nfunction h(s)for stimulus values not presented during training depends\nin a complicated way on its smoothness and the number and smoothnessof the basis functions f\n(s).\nIt is not obvious how the delta rule of equation 8.60 could be imple-\nmented biophysically, because the network has to compute the difference\nh(s)f(sm)\u2212v(sm)f(sm). One possibility is that the two terms h(sm)f(sm)\nandv(sm)f(sm)could be computed in separate phases. First, the output\nof the network is clamped to the desired value h(sm)and Hebbian plas-\nticity is applied. Then, the network runs freely to generate v(sm)and\nanti-Hebbian modi \ufb01cations are made. In the next section, we discuss a\nparticular example of this in the case of the Boltzmann machine, and weshow how learning rules intended for supervised learning can sometimesbe used for unsupervised learning as well.\nContrastive Hebbian Learning\nIn chapter 7, we presented the Boltzmann machine, which is a stochastic\nnetwork with binary units. One of the key innovations associated with theBoltzmann machine is a synaptic modi \ufb01cation rule that has a sound foun-\ndation in probability theory. We start by describing the case of supervisedlearning, although the underlying theory is similar for both supervisedand unsupervised learning with the Boltzmann machine.\nWe\ufb01rst consider a Boltzmann machine with only feedforward weights W\nconnecting utov. Given an input u, an output vis computed by setting\neach component\nvato one with probability F(/summationtext\nbWabub)(and zero other-\nwise) where F(I)=1/(1+exp(\u2212I)). This is the Gibbs sampling procedure\ndiscussed in chapter 7 applied to the feedforward Boltzmann machine. Be-cause there are no recurrent connections, the states of the output units areindependent, and they can all be sampled simultaneously. Analogous tothe discussion in chapter 7, this procedure gives rise to a conditional prob-ability distribution P[v\n|u;W]f o r vgiven uthat can be written as\nP[v|u;W]=exp(\u2212E(u,v))\nZ(u)with Z(u)=/summationdisplay\nvexp(\u2212E(u,v)) (8.61)\nwhere E(u,v)=\u2212v\u00b7W\u00b7u.\nSupervised learning in deterministic networks involves the development\nof a relationship between inputs uand outputs vthat matches, as closely as\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n42 Plasticity and Learning\npossible, a set of samples (um,vm)form=1,2,..., NS. An analogous task\nfor a stochastic network is to match the distribution P[v|u;W] as closely\nas possible to a probability distribution P[v|u] associated with the sam-\nples(um,vm). This is done by adjusting the feedforward weight matrix\nW. Note that we are using the argument Wto distinguish between two\ndifferent distributions, P[u|v], which is provided externally and generates\nthe sample data, and P[u|v;W], which is the distribution generated by the\nBoltzmann machine with weights W. The idea of constructing networks\nthat reproduce probability distributions inferred from sample data is cen-tral to the problem of density estimation covered more fully in chapter 10. density estimation\nThe natural measure for determining how well the distribution generated\nby the network P[v\n|u;W] matches the sampled distribution P[v|u]f o ra\nparticular input uis the Kullback-Leibler divergence,\nDKL(P[v|u],P[v|u;W])=/summationdisplay\nvP[v|u]l n/parenleftbiggP[v|u]\nP[v|u;W]/parenrightbigg\n=\u2212/summationdisplay\nvP[v|u]l n(P[v|u;W])+K, (8.62)\nwhere Kis a term that is proportional to the entropy of the distribution\nP[v|u] (see chapter 4). We do not write out this term explicitly because it\ndoes not depend on the feedforward weight matrix, so it does not affectthe learning rule used to modify W. As in chapter 7, we have, for conve-\nnience, used natural rather than base 2 logarithms in the de \ufb01nition of the\nKullback-Leibler divergence.\nTo estimate, from the samples, how well P[v\n|u;W] matches P[v|u]a c r o s s\nthe different values of u, we average the Kullback-Leibler divergence over\nall of the input samples um. We also use the sample outputs vmto pro-\nvide a stochastic approximation of the sum over all vin equation 8.62 with\nweighting factor P[v|u]. Using brackets to denote the average over sam-\nples, this results in the measure\n/angbracketleftDKL(P[v|u],P[v|u;W])/angbracketright=\u22121\nNSNS/summationdisplay\nm=1ln/parenleftbig\nP[vm|um;W]/parenrightbig+/angbracketleftK/angbracketright (8.63)\nfor comparing P[v|u;W] and P[v|u].

In a stochastic gradient ascent scheme, the\nchange in the weight matrix after sample mis presented only depends on\nthe log likelihood for that sample, so we only need to take the derivativewith respect to W\nabof the corresponding term in equation 8.63,\n\u2202lnP[vm|um;W]\n\u2202Wab=\u2202\n\u2202Wab/parenleftbigg\n\u2212E(um,vm)\u2212lnZ(um)/parenrightbigg\n=vm\naum\nb\u2212/summationdisplay\nvP[v|um;W]vaum\nb.

For Boltzmann machines with recurrent connections like the ones wediscuss below, this average cannot be calculated tractably. However, be-cause the learning rule is used repeatedly, it can be estimated by stochasticsampling. In other words, we approximate the average over vby a sin-\ngle instance of a particular output v\n(um)generated by the Boltzmann ma-\nchine in response to the input um. Making this replacement and setting\nthe change in the weight matrix proportional to the derivative in equation8.64, we obtain the learning rule supervised\nlearning for W\nW\nab\u2192Wab+/epsilon1w/parenleftbigvm\naum\nb\u2212va(um)um\nb/parenrightbig. (8.65)\nEquation 8.65 is identical in form to the perceptron learning rule of equa-\ntion 8.56, except that v(um)is computed from the input umby Gibbs sam-\npling rather than by a deterministic rule. As discussed at the end of theprevious section, equation 8.65 can also be interpreted as the differenceof Hebbian and anti-Hebbian terms. The Hebbian term\nvm\naum\nbis based on\nthe sample input umand output vm. The anti-Hebbian term \u2212va(um)um\nb\ninvolves the product of the sample input umwith an output v(um)gener-\nated by the Boltzmann machine in response to this input, rather than thesample output v\nm. In other words, while vmis provided externally, v(um)\nis obtained by Gibbs sampling using the input umand the current val-\nues of the network weights. The overall learning rule is sometimes calleda contrastive Hebbian rule because it depends on the difference between contrastive\nHebbian rule Hebbian and anti-Hebbian terms.\nSupervised learning for the Boltzmann machine is run in two phases, both\nof which use a sample input u\nm.T h e \ufb01rst phase, sometimes called the\nwake phase, involves Hebbian plasticity between sample inputs and out- wake phase\nputs. The dynamics of the Boltzmann machine play no role during thisphase. The second phase, called the sleep phase, consists of the network sleep phase\n\u2018dreaming\u2019 (i.e. internally generating) v\n(um)in response to umbased on the\ncurrent weights W. Then, anti-Hebbian learning based on umand v(um)\nis applied to the weight matrix. Gibbs sampling is typically used to gen-\nerate v(um)from um.

When the output units are connected by asymmetric recurrent weight matrix M(with M\naa=0), the energy function\nis\nE(u,v)=\u2212v\u00b7W\u00b7u\u22121\n2v\u00b7M\u00b7v. (8.66)\nEverything that has been described thus far applies to this case, except\nthat the output v(um)for the sample input ummust now be computed by\nrepeated Gibbs sampling using F(/summationtext\nbWabum\nb+/summationtext\na/primeMaa/primeva/prime)for the proba-\nbility that va=1 (see chapter 7). Repeated sampling is required to assure\nthat the network relaxes to the equilibrium distribution of equation 8.61.Modi \ufb01cation of the feedforward weight W\nabthen proceeds as in equa-\ntion 8.65.

(8.67)\nThe Boltzmann machine was originally introduced in the context of un-\nsupervised rather than supervised learning. In the supervised case, wetried to make the distribution P[v\n|u;W] match the probability distribu-\ntion P[v|u] that generates the samples pairs (um,vm). In the unsupervised\ncase, no output sample vmis provided, and instead we try to make the\nnetwork generate a probability distribution over uthat matches the dis-\ntribution P[u] from which the samples umare drawn. As we discuss in\nchapter 10, a common goal of probabilistic unsupervised learning is togenerate network distributions that match the distributions of input data.\nIn addition to the distribution of equation 8.61 for vgiven a speci \ufb01c input\nu, the energy function of the Boltzmann machine can be used to de \ufb01ne a\ndistribution over both uand vde\ufb01ned by\nP[u\n,v;W]=exp(\u2212E(u,v))\nZwith Z=/summationdisplay\nu,vexp(\u2212E(u,v)) .

(8.69)\nThe goal of unsupervised learning for the Boltzmann machine is to make\nthis distribution match, as closely as possible, the distribution of inputsP[u].\nThe derivation of an unsupervised learning rule for a feedforward Boltz-\nmann machine proceeds very much like the derivation we presented for\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The equivalent of equation 8.64 is\n\u2202lnP[um;W]\n\u2202Wab=/summationdisplay\nvP[v|um;W]vaum\nb\u2212/summationdisplay\nu,vP[u,v;W]vaub. (8.70)\nIn this case, both terms must be evaluated by Gibbs sampling. The wake\nphase Hebbian term requires a stochastic output v(um), which is calcu-\nlated from the sample input umjust as it was for the anti-Hebbian term\nin equation 8.65. However, the sleep phase anti-Hebbian term in this caserequires both an input uand an output vgenerated by the network. These\nare computed using a Gibbs sampling procedure in which both input andoutput states are stochastically generated through repeated Gibbs sam-pling. A randomly chosen component\nvais set to one with probability\nF(/summationtext\nbWabub)(or zero otherwise), and a random component ubis set to one\nwith probability F(/summationtext\navaWab)(or zero otherwise). Note that this corre-\nsponds to having the input units drive the output units in a feedforwardmanner through the weights Wand having the output units drive the in-\nput units in a reversed manner using feedback weights with the same val-ues. Once the network has settled to equilibrium through repeated Gibbssampling of this sort, and the stochastic inputs and outputs have beengenerated, the full learning rule is unsupervised\nlearning for W\nW\nab\u2192Wab+/epsilon1w/parenleftbigva(um)um\nb\u2212vaub/parenrightbig. (8.71)\nThe unsupervised learning rule can be extended to include recurrent con-\nnections by following the same general procedure.\n8.5 Chapter Summary\nWe presented a variety of forms of Hebbian synaptic plasticity rangingfrom the basic Hebb rule to rules that involve multiplicative and subtrac-tive normalization, a constant or sliding thresholds, and spike-timing ef-fects. Two important features in synaptic plasticity were emphasized, sta-bility and competition. We showed how the effects of unsupervised Heb-bian learning could be estimated by computing the principal eigenvectorof the correlation matrix of the inputs used during training. Unsuper-vised Hebbian learning could be interpreted as a process that producesweights that project the input vector onto the direction of maximal vari-ance in the training data set. In some cases, this requires an extensionfrom correlation-based to covariance-based rules. We used the principaleigenvector approach to analyze Hebbian models of the development ofocular dominance and its associated map in primary visual cortex. Plas-ticity rules based on the dependence of synaptic modi \ufb01cation on spike\ntiming were shown to implement temporal sequence and trace learning.\nForcing multiple outputs to have different selectivities requires them to be\nconnected, either through \ufb01xed weights or by weights that are themselves\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n46 Plasticity and Learning\nplastic. In the latter case, anti-Hebbian plasticity can ensure decorrelation\nof multiple output units. We also considered the role of competition andcooperation in models of activity-dependent development and describedtwo examples of feature-based models, the self-organizing map and theelastic net.\nFinally, we considered supervised learning applied to binary classi \ufb01ca-\ntion and function approximation, using supervised Hebbian learning, theperceptron learning rule, and gradient descent learning through the deltarule. We also treated contrastive Hebbian learning for the Boltzmann ma-chine, involving Hebbian and anti-Hebbian updates in different phases.\n8.6 Appendix\nConvergence of the Perceptron Learning Rule\nFor convenience, we take /epsilon1w=1 and start the perceptron learning rule\nwith w=000 and \u03b3=0. Then, under presentation of the sample m,t h e\nchanges in the weights and threshold are given by\n/Delta1w=1\n2(vm\u2212v(um))umand /Delta1\u03b3=\u22121\n2(vm\u2212v(um)). (8.72)\nGiven a \ufb01nite, linearly separable problem, there must be a set of weights\nw\u2217and a threshold \u03b3\u2217that are normalized ( |w\u2217|2+(\u03b3\u2217)2=1) and allow\nthe perceptron to categorize correctly, for which we require the condition\n(w\u2217\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3\u2217)vm>\u03b4for some \u03b4>0 and for all m.\nConsider the cosine of the angle between the current weights and thresh-\noldw,\u03b3and the solution w\u2217,\u03b3\u2217\n/Phi1(w,\u03b3)=w\u00b7w\u2217+\u03b3\u03b3\u2217\n/radicalbig\n|w|2+(\u03b3)2=\u03c8(w,\u03b3)\n|w,\u03b3|, (8.73)\nto introduce some compact notation. Because it is a cosine, /Phi1must lie\nbetween \u22121 and 1. The perceptron convergence theorem shows the per-\nceptron learning rule must lead to a solution of the categorization problemor else\n/Phi1would grow larger than one, which is impossible.\nTo show this, we consider the change in \u03c8due to one step of perceptron\nlearning during which wand\u03b3are modi \ufb01ed because the current weights\ngenerated the wrong response. When an incorrect response is generated\nv(um)=\u2212vm,s o(vm\u2212v(um))/2=vm, and thus\n/Delta1\u03c8=(w\u2217\u00b7um\u2212\u03b3\u2217)vm>\u03b4. (8.74)\nThe inequality follows from the condition imposed on w\u2217and\u03b3\u2217as pro-\nviding a solution of the categorization problem. Assuming that \u03c8is ini-\ntially positive and iterating this result over nsteps in which the weights\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(8.77)\nAfter nnon-trivial learning iterations (iterations in which the weights and\nthreshold are modi \ufb01ed) starting from |w,\u03b3|2=0, we therefore have\n|w,\u03b3|2<n(D+1) (8.78)\nPutting together equations 8.75 and 8.78, we \ufb01nd after nnon-trivial train-\ning steps\n/Phi1(w,\u03b3)>n\u03b4\u221an(D+1). (8.79)\nTo ensure that /Phi1(w,\u03b3)\u22641, we must have n\u2264(D+1)/\u03b42. Therefore, after\na\ufb01nite number of weight changes, the perceptron learning rule must stop\nchanging the weights, and the perceptron must classify all the patternscorrectly.\n8.7 Annotated Bibliography\nHebb\u2019s (1949) original proposal about learning set the stage for many of\nthe subsequent investigations.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\nChapter 9\nClassical Conditioning and\nReinforcement Learning\n9.1 Introduction\nThe ability of animals to learn to take appropriate actions in response to\nparticular stimuli on the basis of associated rewards or punishments is afocus of behavioral psychology. The \ufb01eld is traditionally separated into\nclassical (or Pavlovian) and instrumental (or operant) conditioning. In classical and\ninstrumental\nconditioningclassical conditioning, the reinforcers (i.e. the rewards or punishments) are\ndelivered independently of any actions taken by the animal. In instrumen-tal conditioning, the actions of the animal determine what reinforcementis provided. Learning about stimuli or actions solely on the basis of therewards and punishments associated with them is called reinforcementlearning. As discussed in chapter 8, reinforcement learning is minimally reinforcement\nlearning supervised because animals are not told explicitly what actions to take in\nparticular situations, but must work this out for themselves on the basis ofthe reinforcement they receive.\nWe begin this chapter with a discussion of aspects of classical condition-\ning and the models that have been developed to account for them. We \ufb01rst\ndiscuss various pairings of one or more stimuli with presentation or denialof a reward and present a simple learning algorithm that summarizes theresults. We then present an algorithm, called temporal difference learning,that leads to predictions of both the presence and timing of rewards deliv-ered after a delay following stimulus presentation. Two neural systems,the cerebellum and the midbrain dopamine system, have been particu-larly well studied from the perspective of conditioning. The cerebellumhas been studied in association with eyeblink conditioning, a paradigmin which animals learn to shut their eyes just in advance of disturbancessuch as puffs of air that are signalled by cues. The midbrain dopaminergic\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nsystem has been studied in association with reward learning. We focus on\nthe latter, together with a small fraction of the extensive behavioral dataon conditioning.\nThere are two broad classes of instrumental conditioning tasks. In the \ufb01rst\nclass, which we illustrate with an example of foraging by bees, the re-inforcer is delivered immediately after the action is taken. This makeslearning relatively easy. In the second class, the reward or punishmentdepends on an entire sequence of actions and is partly or wholly delayeduntil the sequence is completed. Thus, learning the appropriate action at delayed rewards\neach step in the sequence must be based on future expectation, rather thanimmediate receipt, of reward. This makes learning more dif \ufb01cult. Despite\nthe differences between classical and instrumental conditioning, we showhow to use the temporal difference model we discuss for classical condi-tioning as the heart of a model of instrumental conditioning when rewardsare delayed.\nFor consistency with the literature on reinforcement learning, throughout\nthis chapter, the letter ris used to represent a reward rather than a \ufb01ring\nrate. Also, for convenience, we consider discrete actions such as a choicebetween two alternatives, rather than a continuous range of actions. Wealso consider trials that consist of a number of discrete events and use aninteger time variable t\n=0,1,2,... to indicate steps during a trial. We\ntherefore also use discrete weight update rules (like those we discussedfor supervised learning in chapter 8) rather than learning rules describedby differential equations.\n9.2 Classical Conditioning\nClassical conditioning involves a wide range of different training and test-ing procedures and a rich set of behavioral phenomena. The basic pro-cedures and results we discuss are summarized in table 9.1. Rather thangoing through the entries in the table at this point, we introduce a learningalgorithm that serves to summarize and structure these results.\nIn the classic Pavlovian experiment, dogs are repeatedly fed just after a\nbell is rung. Subsequently, the dogs salivate whenever the bell soundsas if they expect food to arrive. The food is called the unconditionedstimulus. Dogs naturally salivate when they receive food, and salivation unconditioned\nstimulus andresponseis thus called the unconditioned response. The bell is called the condi-\ntioned stimulus because it only elicits salivation under the condition that\nconditioned\nstimulus andresponsethere has been prior learning. The learned salivary response to the bell\nis called the conditioned response. We do not use this terminology in thefollowing discussion. Instead, we treat those aspects of the conditioned re-sponses that mark the animal\u2019s expectation of the delivery of reward, andbuild models of how these expectations are learned. We therefore refer tostimuli, rewards, and expectation of reward.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The columns indicate the training\nprocedures and results, with some paradigms requiring a pre-training as well asa training period. Both training and pre-training periods consist of a moderatenumber of training trials. The arrows represent an association between one ortwo stimuli ( s,o r s\n1and s2) and either a reward ( r) or the absence of a reward\n(\u00b7). In Partial and Inhibitory conditioning, the two types of training trials that are\nindicated are alternated. In the Result column, the arrows represent an associationbetween a stimulus and the expectation of a reward (\u2018 r\u2019) or no reward (\u2018\n\u00b7\u2019). The\nfactors of \u03b1denote a partial or weakened expectation, and the minus sign indicates\nthe suppression of an expectation of reward.\nPredicting Reward - The Rescorla-Wagner Rule\nThe Rescorla-Wagner rule (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972), which is a version\nof the delta rule of chapter 8, provides a concise account of certain aspectsof classical conditioning. The rule is based on a simple linear predictionof the award associated with a stimulus. We use a binary variable uto\nrepresent the presence or absence of the stimulus ( u\n=1 if the stimulus\nis present, u=0 if it is absent). The expected reward, denoted by v,i s stimulus u\nexpected reward v expressed as this stimulus variable multiplied by a weight w,\nweight wv=wu. (9.1)\nThe value of the weight is established by a learning rule designed to min-\nimize the expected squared error between the actual reward rand the\nprediction v,/angbracketleft(r\u2212v)2/angbracketright. The angle brackets indicate an average over the\npresentations of the stimulus and reward, either or both of which may bestochastic. As we saw in chapter 8, stochastic gradient descent in the formof the delta rule is one way of minimizing this error. This results in thetrial-by-trial learning rule known as the Rescorla-Wagner rule, Rescorla-Wagner\nrule\nw\u2192w+/epsilon1\u03b4uwith \u03b4=r\u2212v. (9.2)\nHere/epsilon1is the learning rate, which can be interpreted in psychological terms\nas the associability of the stimulus with the reward. The crucial term inthis learning rule is the prediction error,\n\u03b4. In a later section, we interpret\nthe activity of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) asencoding a form of this prediction error. If\n/epsilon1is suf \ufb01ciently small, the rule\nchanges wsystematically until the average value of \u03b4is zero, at which\npoint w\ufb02uctuates about the equilibrium value w=/angbracketleftur/angbracketright.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n0 100 200\ntrial numberw\nFigure 9.1: Acquisition and extinction curves for Pavlovian conditioning and par-\ntial reinforcement as predicted by the Rescorla-Wagner model.

In the \ufb01rst 100 trials, a re-\nward of r=1 was paired with the stimulus, while in trials 100-200 no reward was\npaired ( r=0). Open squares show the evolution of the weights when a reward of\nr=1 was paired with the stimulus randomly on 50% of the trials. In both cases,\n/epsilon1=0.05.\nThe\ufb01lled circles in \ufb01gure 9.1 show how learning progresses according to\nthe Rescorla-Wagner rule during Pavlovian conditioning and extinction. Pavlovian\nconditioning\nextinctionIn this example, the stimulus and reward were both initially presented\non each trial, but later the reward was removed. The weight approachesthe asymptotic limit\nw=rexponentially during the rewarded phase of\ntraining (conditioning), and exponentially decays to w=0 during the un-\nrewarded phase (extinction). Experimental learning curves are generallymore sigmoidal in shape. There are various ways to account for this dis-crepancy, the simplest of which is to assume a nonlinear relationship be-tween the expectation\nvand the behavior of the animal.\nThe Rescorla-Wagner rule also accounts for aspects of the phenomenon of\npartial reinforcement, in which a reward is only associated with a stimulus partial\nreinforcement on a random fraction of trials (table 9.1). Behavioral measures of the ulti-\nmate association of the reward with the stimulus in these cases indicatethat it is weaker than when the reward is always presented. This is ex-pected from the delta rule, because the ultimate steady-state average valueof\nw=/angbracketleftur/angbracketrightis smaller than rin this case. The open squares in \ufb01gure 9.1\nshow what happens to the weight when the reward is associated with thestimulus 50% of the time. After an initial rise from zero, the weight variesrandomly around an average value of 0.5.\nTo account for experiments in which more than one stimulus is used in\nassociation with a reward, the Rescorla-Wagner rule must be extended toinclude multiple stimuli. This is done by introducing a vector of binaryvariables u, with each of its components representing the presence or ab- stimulus vector u\nsence of a given stimulus, together with a vector of weights w.

(9.4)\nVarious classical conditioning experiments probe the way that predic-\ntions are shared between multiple stimuli (see table 9.1). Blocking is the blocking\nparadigm that \ufb01rst led to the suggestion of the delta rule in connection\nwith classical conditioning. In blocking, two stimuli are presented to-gether with the reward, but only after an association has already devel-oped for one stimulus by itself. In other words, during the pre-trainingperiod, a stimulus is associated with a reward as in Pavlovian condition-ing. Then, during the training period, a second stimulus is present alongwith the \ufb01rst in association with the same reward. In this case, the pre-\nexisting association of the \ufb01rst stimulus with the reward blocks an asso-\nciation from forming between the second stimulus and the reward. Thus,after training, a conditioned response is only evoked by the \ufb01rst stimulus,\nnot by the second. This follows from the vector form of the delta rule,because training with the \ufb01rst stimulus makes\nw1=r. When the second\nstimulus is presented along with the \ufb01rst, its weight starts out at w2=0,\nbut the prediction of reward v=w1u1+w2u2is still equal to r. This makes\n\u03b4=0, so no further weight modi \ufb01cation occurs.\nA standard way to induce inhibitory conditioning is to use trials in which inhibitory\nconditioning one stimulus is shown in conjunction with the reward in alternation with\ntrials in which that stimulus and an additional stimulus are presented inthe absence of reward. In this case, the second stimulus becomes a con-ditioned inhibitor, predicting the absence of reward. This can be demon-strated by presenting a third stimulus that also predicts reward, in con-junction with the inhibitory stimulus, and showing that the net predictionof reward is reduced. It can also be demonstrated by showing that subse-quent learning of an positive association between the inhibitory stimulusand reward is slowed. Inhibition emerges naturally from the delta rule.Trials in which the \ufb01rst stimulus is associated with a reward result in a\npositive value of\nw1. Over trials in which both stimuli are presented to-\ngether, the net prediction v=w1+w2comes to be 0, so w2is forced to be\nnegative.\nA further example of the interaction between stimuli is overshadowing. overshadowing\nIf two stimuli are presented together during training, the prediction ofreward is shared between them. After application of the delta rule,\nv=\nw1+w2=r. However, the prediction is often shared unequally, as if one\nstimulus is more salient than the other. Overshadowing can be encom-passed by generalizing the delta rule so that the two stimuli have differ-ent learning rates (different values of\n/epsilon1), re\ufb02ecting unequal associabilities.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nWeight modi \ufb01cation stops when /angbracketleft\u03b4/angbracketright=0, at which point the faster growing\nweight will be larger than the slower growing weight. Various, more sub-tle, effects come from having different and modi \ufb01able associabilities, but\nthey lie beyond the scope of our account.\nThe Rescorla-Wagner rule, binary stimulus parameters, and linear reward\nprediction are obviously gross simpli \ufb01cations of animal learning behav-\nior. Yet they summarize and unify an impressive amount of classical con-ditioning data and are useful, provided their shortcomings are fully ap-preciated. As a reminder of this, we point out one experiment, namelysecondary conditioning, that cannot be encompassed within this scheme.Secondary conditioning involves the association of one stimulus with a re- secondary\nconditioning ward, followed by an association of a second stimulus with the \ufb01rst stim-\nulus (table 9.1). This causes the second stimulus to evoke expectation ofa reward with which it has never been paired (although if pairings of thetwo stimuli without the reward are repeated too many times, the resultis extinction of the association of both stimuli with the reward). The deltarule cannot account for the positive expectation associated with the secondstimulus. Indeed, because the reward does not appear when the secondstimulus is presented, the delta rule would cause\nw2to become negative.\nIn other words, in this case, the delta rule would predict inhibitory, notsecondary, conditioning. Secondary conditioning is particularly impor-tant, because it lies at the heart of our solution to the problem of delayedrewards in instrumental conditioning tasks.\nSecondary conditioning raises the important issue of keeping track of the\ntime within a trial in which stimuli and rewards are present. This is evi-dent because a positive association with the second stimulus is only reli-ably established if it precedes the \ufb01rst stimulus in the trials in which they\nare paired. If the two stimuli are presented simultaneous, the result mayindeed be inhibitory rather than secondary conditioning.\nPredicting Future Reward \u2013 Temporal Difference Learning\nWe measure time within a trial using a discrete time variable t, which falls\nin the range 0 \u2264t\u2264T. The stimulus u(t), the prediction v(t), and the\nreward r(t)are all expressed as functions of t.\nIn addition to associating stimuli with rewards and punishments, animals\ncan learn to predict the future time within a trial at which a reinforcer willbe delivered. We might therefore be tempted to interpret\nv(t)as the re-\nward predicted to be delivered at time step t. However, Sutton and Barto\n(1990) suggested an alternative interpretation of v(t)that provides a bet-\nter match to psychological and neurobiological data, and suggests howanimals might use their predictions to optimize behavior in the face ofdelayed rewards. The suggestion is that the variable\nv(t)should be in-\nterpreted as a prediction of the total future reward expected from time t\nonward to the end of the trial, namely total future reward\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(9.5)\nThe brackets denote an average over trials. This quantity is useful for op-\ntimization, because it summarizes the total expected worth of the currentstate. To compute\nv(t), we generalize the linear relationship used for clas-\nsical conditioning, equation 9.3. For the case of a single time-dependentstimulus u\n(t), we write\nv(t)=t/summationdisplay\n\u03c4=0w(\u03c4) u(t\u2212\u03c4). (9.6)\nThis is just a discrete time version of the sort of linear \ufb01lter used in chapters\n1 and 2.\nArranging for v(t)to predict the total future reward would appear to re-\nquire a simple alteration of the delta rule we have discussed previously,\nw(\u03c4)\u2192w(\u03c4)+/epsilon1\u03b4(t)u(t\u2212\u03c4), (9.7)\nwith\u03b4(t)being the difference between the actual and predicted total future\nreward, \u03b4(t)=/summationtextr(t+\u03c4)\u2212v(t). However, there is a problem with apply-\ning this rule in a stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Computation of\n\u03b4(t)requires knowledge of the total future reward on a given trial. Al-\nthough r(t)is known at this time, the succeeding r(t+1),r(t+2)... have\nyet to be experienced, making it impossible to calculate \u03b4(t). A possible\nsolution is suggested by the recursive formula\nT\u2212t/summationdisplay\n\u03c4=0r(t+\u03c4)=r(t)+T\u2212t\u22121/summationdisplay\n\u03c4=0r(t+1+\u03c4).

There is an extensive body of theory showing circum-stances under which this rule converges to make the correct predictions.\nFigure 9.2 shows what happens when the temporal difference rule is ap-\nplied during a training period in which a stimulus appears at time t\n=100,\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\n0100200012\ntrials\n0100200\u221212\u221212\u2212120201\n0100200\n\u00c6\n/CQ/CT /CU /D3 /D6/CT /CP/CU/D8/CT/D6/D9/D6/DA/A1 /DA\u00c6\n/BT /BU/D8/D8 /D8\nFigure 9.2: Learning to predict a reward. A) The surface plot shows the prediction\nerror\u03b4(t)as a function of time within a trial, across trials. In the early trials, the\npeak error occurs at the time of the reward ( t=200), while in later trials it occurs at\nthe time of the stimulus ( t=100). (B) The rows show the stimulus u(t), the reward\nr(t), the prediction v(t), the temporal difference between predictions /Delta1v(t\u22121)=\nv(t)\u2212v(t\u22121), and the full temporal difference error \u03b4(t\u22121)=r(t\u22121)+/Delta1v(t\u22121).\nThe reward is presented over a short interval, and the prediction vsums the total\nreward. The left column shows the behavior before training, and the right columnafter training.\n/Delta1v(t\u22121)and\u03b4(t\u22121)are plotted instead of /Delta1v(t)and\u03b4(t)because\nthe latter quantities cannot be computed until time t+1 when v(t+1)is available.\nand a reward is given for a short interval around t=200. Initially, w(\u03c4)=0\nfor all \u03c4. Figure 9.2A shows that the temporal difference error starts off be-\ning non-zero only at the time of the reward, t=200, and then, over trials,\nmoves backward in time, eventually stabilizing around the time of thestimulus, where it takes the value 2. This is equal to the (integrated) to-tal reward provided over the course of each trial. Figure 9.2B shows thebehavior during a trial of a number of variables before and after learn-ing. After learning, the prediction\nv(t)is 2 from the time the stimulus is\n\ufb01rst presented ( t=100) until the time the reward starts to be delivered.\nThus, the temporal difference prediction error has a spike at t=99. This\nspike persists, because u(t)=0f o r t<100. The temporal difference term\n/Delta1v(t)is negative around t=200, exactly compensating for the delivery of\nreward, and so making \u03b4=0.\nAs the peak in \u03b4moves backwards from the time of the reward to the time\nof the stimulus, weights w(\u03c4) for\u03c4=100,99,... successively grow. This\ngradually extends the prediction of future reward, v(t), from an initial\ntransient at the time of the stimulus, to a broad plateau extending fromthe time of the stimulus to the time of the reward. Eventually,\nvpredicts\nthe correct total future reward from the time of the stimulus onward, andpredicts the time of the reward delivery by dropping to zero when the re-ward is delivered. The exact shape of the ridge of activity that movesfrom\nt\n=200 to t=100 over the course of trials is sensitive to a number of fac-\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Suppose an association between stimulus s1and\na future reward has been established, as in \ufb01gure 9.2. When, as indicated\nin table 9.1, a second stimulus, s2, is introduced before the \ufb01rst stimulus,\nthe positive spike in \u03b4(t)at the time that s1is presented drives an increase\nin the value of the weight associated with s2and thus establishes a posi-\ntive association between the second stimulus and the reward. This exactlymirrors the primary learning process for s\n1described above. Of course, be-\ncause the reward is not presented in these trials, there is a negative spike in\n\u03b4(t)at the time of the reward itself, and ultimately the association between\nboth s1and s2and the reward extinguishes.\nDopamine and Predictions of Reward\nThe prediction error \u03b4plays an essential role in both the Rescorla-Wagner\nand temporal difference learning rules, and we might hope to \ufb01nd a neural\nsignal that represents this quantity. One suggestion is that the activity ofdopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) in the midbrain ventral tegmental\narea VTA plays this role.\nThere is substantial evidence that dopamine is involved in reward learn- dopamine\ning. Drugs of addiction, such as cocaine and amphetamines, act partlyby increasing the longevity of the dopamine that is released onto targetstructures such as the nucleus accumbens. Other drugs, such as morphineand heroin, also affect the dopamine system. Further, dopamine deliv-ery is important in self-stimulation experiments. Rats will compulsivelypress levers that cause current to be delivered through electrodes into var-ious areas of their brains. One of the most effective self-stimulation sitesis the medial forebrain ascending bundle, which is an axonal pathway.Stimulating this pathway is likely to cause increased delivery of dopamineto the nucleus accumbens because the bundle contains many \ufb01bers from\ndopaminergic cells in the VTA projecting to the nucleus accumbens.\nIn a series of studies by Schultz and his colleagues (Schultz, 1998), mon-\nkeys were trained through instrumental conditioning to respond to stimulisuch as lights and sounds to obtain food and drink rewards. The activi-ties of cells in the VTA were recorded while the monkeys learned thesetasks. Figure 9.3A shows histograms of the mean activities of dopaminecells over the course of learning in one example. The \ufb01gure is based on\na reaction time task in which the monkey keeps a \ufb01nger resting on a key\nuntil a light comes on. The monkey then has to release the key and pressanother one to get a fruit juice reward. The reward is delivered a shorttime after the second key is pressed. The upper plot shows the responseof the cells in early trials. The cells respond vigorously to the reward, butbarely \ufb01re above baseline to the light. The lower plot shows the response\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nstimulus reward-0.5 0.5 -0.5 0 0.5 0early\nlate\n0510\nt (s) t (s)\nHz\nt (s)-1 0 1 2reward\nno rewardAB\nFigure 9.3: Activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA for a monkey perform-\ning a reaction time task.

(Adapted from Schultz, 1998.)\nafter a moderate amount of training. Now, the cell responds to the light,\nbut not to the reward. The responses show a distinct similarity to the plotsof\n\u03b4(t)in\ufb01gure 9.2.\nThe similarity between the responses of the dopaminergic neurons and\nthe quantity \u03b4(t)suggests that their activity provides a prediction error\nfor reward, i.e. an ongoing difference between the amount of reward thatis delivered and the amount that is expected. Figure 9.3B provides furtherevidence for this interpretation. It shows the activity of dopamine cells in asimilar task to that of \ufb01gure 9.3A. The top row of this \ufb01gure shows normal\nperformance, and is just like the bottom row of \ufb01gure 9.3A. The bottom\nrow shows what happens when the monkey is expecting reward, but it isnot delivered. In this case, the cell\u2019s activity is inhibited below baseline atjust the time it would have been activated by the reward in the originaltrials. This is in agreement with the prediction error interpretation of thisactivity.\nSomething similar to the temporal difference learning rule could be real-\nized in a neural system if the dopamine signal representing\n\u03b4acts to gate\nand regulate the plasticity associated with learning. We discuss this possi-bility further in a later section.\n9.3 Static Action Choice\nIn classical conditioning experiments, rewards are directly associated withstimuli. In more natural settings, rewards and punishments are associated\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n9.3 Static Action Choice 11\nwith the actions an animal takes. Animals develop policies, or plans of policy\naction, that increase reward. In studying how this might be done, we con-sider two different cases. In static action choice, the reward or punishmentimmediately follows the action taken. In sequential action choice, rewardmay be delayed until several actions are completed.\nAs an example of static action choice, we consider bees foraging among\n\ufb02owers in search of nectar. We model an experiment in which single bees\nforage under controlled conditions among blue and yellow colored arti- foraging\n\ufb01cial\ufb02owers (small dishes of sugar water sitting on colored cards). In\nactual experiments, the bees learn within a single session (involving visitsto 40 arti \ufb01cial\ufb02owers) about the reward characteristics of the yellow and\nblue \ufb02owers. All else being equal, they preferentially land on the color\nof\ufb02ower that delivers more reward. This preference is maintained over\nmultiple sessions. However, if the reward characteristics of the \ufb02owers\nare interchanged, the bees quickly swap their preferences.\nWe treat a simpli \ufb01ed version of the problem, ignoring the spatial aspects of\nsampling, and assuming that a model bee is faced with repeated choicesbetween two different \ufb02owers. If the bee chooses the blue \ufb02ower on a\ntrial, it receives a quantity of nectar r\nbdrawn from a probability density\np[rb]. If it chooses the yellow \ufb02ower, it receives a quantity ry, drawn from\na probability density p[ry]. The task of choosing between the \ufb02owers is a\nform of stochastic two-armed bandit problem (named after slot machines), two-armed bandit\nand is formally equivalent to many instrumental conditioning tasks.\nThe model bee has a stochastic policy, which means that it chooses blue stochastic policy\nand yellow \ufb02owers with probabilities that we write as P[b] and P[y] re-\nspectively. A convenient way to parameterize these probabilities is to usethe softmax distribution softmax\nP[b]\n=exp(\u03b2mb)\nexp(\u03b2mb)+exp(\u03b2my)P[y]=exp(\u03b2my)\nexp(\u03b2mb)+exp(\u03b2my)(9.11)\nHere, mband myare parameters, known as action values, that are ad- action values m\njusted by one of the learning processes described below. Note that\nP[b]+P[y]=1, corresponding to the fact that the model bee invariably\nmakes one of the two choices. Note that P[b]=\u03c3(\u03b2( mb\u2212my))where\n\u03c3(m)=1/(1+exp(\u2212m))is the standard sigmoid function, which grows\nmonotonically from zero to one as mvaries from \u2212\u221e to\u221e.P[y] is sim-\nilarly a sigmoid function of \u03b2(my\u2212mb). The parameters mband myde-\ntermine the frequency at which blue and yellow \ufb02owers are visited. Their\nvalues must be adjusted during the learning process on the basis of thereward provided.\nThe parameter\n\u03b2determines the variability of the bee\u2019s actions and ex-\nerts a strong in \ufb02uence over exploration. For large \u03b2, the probability of\nan action rises rapidly to one, or falls rapidly to zero, as the difference be-tween the action values increases or decreases. This makes the bee\u2019s actionchoice almost a deterministic function of the mvariables. If\n\u03b2is small, the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nsoftmax probability approaches one or zero more slowly, and the bee\u2019s ac-\ntions are more variable and random. Thus, \u03b2controls the balance between\nexploration (small \u03b2) and exploitation (large \u03b2). The choice of whether\nto explore to determine if the current policy can be improved, or to ex-ploit the available resources on the basis of the current policy, is knownas the exploration-exploitation dilemma. Exploration is clearly critical, be- exploration-\nexploitationdilemmacause the bee must sample from the two colors of \ufb02owers to determine\nwhich is better, and keep sampling to make sure that the reward condi-tions have not changed. But exploration is costly, because the bee has tosample \ufb02ower it believes to be less bene \ufb01cial, to check if this is really the\ncase. Some algorithms adjust\n\u03b2over trials, but we will not consider this\npossibility.\nThere are only two possible actions in the example we study, but the exten-\nsion to multiple actions, a=1,2,..., Na, is straightforward. In this case, a\nvector mof parameters controls the decision process, and the probability action value\nvector m P[a] of choosing action ais\nP[a]=exp(\u03b2ma)\n/summationtextNa\na/prime=1exp(\u03b2ma/prime). (9.12)\nWe consider two simple methods of solving the bee foraging task. In the\n\ufb01rst method, called the indirect actor, the bee learns to estimate the ex-\npected nectar volumes provided by each \ufb02ower using a delta rule. It then\nbases its action choice on these estimates. In the second method, calledthe direct actor, the choice of actions is based directly on maximizing theexpected average reward.\nThe Indirect Actor\nOne course for the bee to follow is to learn the average nectar volumesprovided by each type of \ufb02ower and base its action choice on these. This is\ncalled an indirect actor scheme, because the policy is mediated indirectly indirect actor\nby the expected volumes. Here, this means setting the action values to\nm\nb=/angbracketleftrb/angbracketrightand my=/angbracketleftry/angbracketright. (9.13)\nIn our discussion of classical conditioning, we saw that the Rescorla-\nWagner or delta rule develops weights that approximate the average valueof a reward, just as required for equation 9.13. Thus if the bee chooses ablue\ufb02ower on a trial and receives nectar volume r\nb, it should update mb\naccording to the prediction error by\nmb\u2192mb+/epsilon1\u03b4 with \u03b4=rb\u2212mb, (9.14)\nand leave myunchanged. If it lands on a yellow \ufb02ower, myis changed to\nmy+/epsilon1\u03b4with\u03b4=ry\u2212my, and mbis unchanged. If the probability densities\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

This experiment was designed to test risk aversion in the bees, so\nthe blue and yellow \ufb02owers differed in the reliability rather than the quan-\ntity of their nectar delivery. For the \ufb01rst 15 trials (each involving 40 visits\nto\ufb02owers), blue \ufb02owers always provided 2 \u00b5l of nectar, whereas1\n3of the\nyellow \ufb02owers provided 6 \u00b5l, and2\n3provided nothing (note that the mean\nreward is the same for the two \ufb02ower types).

Figure 9.5A shows\nthe average performance of \ufb01ve bees on this task in terms of their percent-\nage visits to the blue \ufb02owers across trials. They exhibit a strong preference\nfor the constant \ufb02ower type and switch this preference within only a few\nvisits to the \ufb02owers when the contingencies change.\nTo apply the foraging model we have been discussing to the experiment\nshown in \ufb01gure 9.5A, we need to model the risk avoidance exhibited by\nthe bees, that is, their reluctance to choose the unreliable \ufb02ower. One way\nto do this is to assume that the bees base their policy on the subjectiveutility function of the nectar volume shown in \ufb01gure 9.5B, rather than on subjective utility\nthe nectar volume itself. Because the function is concave, the mean utilityof the unreliable \ufb02owers is less than that of the reliable \ufb02owers. Figure 9.5C\nshows that the choices of the model bee match quite well those of the realbees. The model bee is less variable than the actual bees (even more thanit appears, because the curve in 9.5A is averaged over \ufb01ve bees), perhaps\nbecause the model bees are not sampling from a two-dimensional array of\ufb02owers.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n9.3 Static Action Choice 15\nThe Direct Actor\nAn alternative to basing action choice on average rewards is to choose\naction values directly to maximize the average expected reward. The ex- direct actor\npected reward per trial is given in terms of the action values and averagerewards per \ufb02ower by\n/angbracketleftr/angbracketright=P[b]/angbracketleftrb/angbracketright+P[y]/angbracketleftry/angbracketright. (9.15)\nThis can be maximized by stochastic gradient ascent. To see how this is\ndone, we take the derivative of /angbracketleftr/angbracketrightwith respect to mb,\n\u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\n\u2202mb=\u03b2/parenleftbig\nP[b]P[y]/angbracketleftrb/angbracketright\u2212P[y]P[b]/angbracketleftry/angbracketright/parenrightbig. (9.16)\nIn deriving this result, we have used the fact that\n\u2202P[b]\n\u2202mb=\u03b2P[b]P[y] and\u2202P[y]\n\u2202mb=\u2212\u03b2P[y]P[b]. (9.17)\nUsing the relation P[y]=1\u2212P[b], we can rewrite equation 9.16 as\n\u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\n\u2202mb=\u03b2P[b](1\u2212P[b])/angbracketleftrb/angbracketright\u2212\u03b2P[y]P[b]/angbracketleftry/angbracketright. (9.18)\nFurthermore, we can include an arbitrary parameter rin both these terms,\nbecause it cancels out. Thus,\n\u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright\n\u2202mb=\u03b2P[b](1\u2212P[b])(/angbracketleftrb/angbracketright\u2212r)\u2212\u03b2P[y]P[b]/parenleftbig/angbracketleftry/angbracketright\u2212r/parenrightbig. (9.19)\nA similar expression applies to \u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/\u2202myexcept that the blue and yellow\nlabels are interchanged.\nIn stochastic gradient ascent, the changes in the parameter mbare de-\ntermined such that, averaged over trials, they end up proportional to\n\u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/\u2202mb. We can derive a stochastic gradient ascent rule for mbfrom equa-\ntion 9.19 in two steps. First, we interpret the two terms on the right handside as changes associated with the choice of blue and yellow \ufb02owers re-\nspectively. This accounts for the factors P[b] and P[y] respectively. Second,\nwe note that over trials in which blue is selected, r\nb\u2212raverages to /angbracketleftrb/angbracketright\u2212r,\nand over trials in which yellow is selected, ry\u2212raverages to /angbracketleftry/angbracketright\u2212r. Thus,\nif we change mbaccording to\nmb\u2192 mb+/epsilon1(1\u2212P[b])(rb\u2212r)if b is selected\nmb\u2192 mb\u2212/epsilon1P[b](ry\u2212r) if y is selected,\nthe average change in mbis proportional to \u2202/angbracketleftr/angbracketright/\u2202mb. Note that mbis\nchanged even when the bee chooses the yellow \ufb02ower. We can summa-\nrize this learning rule as\nmb\u2192mb+/epsilon1(\u03b4 ab\u2212P[b])(ra\u2212r) (9.20)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\n0 100 200-505\nvisits to flowers0 100 200020406080100120\nvisits to flowerssum visits\n0 100 200-505\nvisits to flowers0 100 200020406080100120\nvisits to flowerssum visitsm\nmmy\nmy\nmbmb blue\nblueyellowyellowAB\nC D\nFigure 9.6: The direct actor.

Compared to the indirect actor,initial learning is quite slow, and the behavior after the reward character-istics of the \ufb02owers are interchanged can be poor.

Despite its\ncomparatively poor performance in this task, the direct actor is importantbecause it is used later as a model for how action choice can be separatedfrom action evaluation.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Upon reaching one of the end points (the shaded boxes), it receivesthe number of food pellets indicated and the trial ends. Decision points are A, B,and C.\nThe direct actor learning rule can be extended to multiple actions, a=\n1,2,..., Na, by using the multidimensional form of the softmax distribu-\ntion (equation 9.12).

(9.22)\n9.4 Sequential Action Choice\nIn the previous section, we considered ways that animals might learn\nto choose actions on the basis of immediate information about the con-sequences of those actions. A signi \ufb01cant complication that arises when\nreward is based on a sequence of actions is illustrated by the maze taskshown in \ufb01gure 9.7. In this example, a hungry rat has to move through a\nmaze, starting from point A, without retracing its steps. When it reachesone of the shaded boxes, it receives the associated number of food pelletsand is removed from the maze. The rat then starts again at A. The taskis to optimize the total reward, which in this case entails moving left at Aand right at B. It is assumed that the animal starts knowing nothing aboutthe structure of the maze or about the rewards.\nIf the rat started from point B or point C, it could learn to move right\nor left (respectively) using the methods of the previous section, becauseit experiences an immediate consequence of its actions in the delivery ornon-delivery of food. The dif \ufb01culty arises because neither action at the\nactual starting point, A, leads directly to a reward. For example, if the ratgoes left at A and also goes left at B, it has to \ufb01gure out that the former\nchoice was good but the latter bad. This is a typical problem in tasks thatinvolve delayed rewards. The reward for going left at A is delayed untilafter the rat also goes right at B.\nThere is an extensive body of theory in engineering, called dynamic\nprogramming, as to how systems of any sort can come to select appro- dynamic\nprogramming\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n18 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\npriate actions in optimizing control problems similar to (and substantially\nmore complicated than) the maze task. An important method on whichwe focus is called policy iteration. Our reinforcement learning version of policy iteration\npolicy iteration maintains and improves a stochastic policy, which deter-mines the actions at each decision point (i.e. left or right turns at A, B, or C)through action values and the softmax distribution of equation 9.12. Policyiteration involves two elements. One, called the critic, uses temporal dif- critic\nference learning to estimate the total future reward that is expected whenstarting from A, B, or C, when the current policy is followed. The other el-ement, called the actor, maintains and improves the policy. Adjustment of actor\nthe action values at point A is based on predictions of the expected futurerewards associated with points B and C that are provided by the critic. Ineffect, the rat learns the appropriate action at A using the same methods ofstatic action choice that allow it to learn the appropriate actions at B andC. However, rather than using an immediate reward as the reinforcementsignal, it uses the expectations about future reward that are provided bythe critic.\nThe Maze Task\nAs we mentioned when discussing the direct actor, a stochastic policy is away of assigning a probability distribution over actions (in this case choos-ing to turn either left or right) to each location (A, B, or C). The locationis speci \ufb01ed by a variable uthat takes the values A, B, or C, and a two-\ncomponent action value vector m\n(u)is associated with each location. The\ncomponents of the action vector m(u)control the probability of taking a\nleft or a right turn at u.\nThe immediate reward provided when action ais taken at location uis\nwritten as ra(u). This takes the values 0, 2, or 5 depending on the values\nofuand a. The predicted future reward expected at location uis given by\nv(u)=w(u). This is an estimate of the total award that the rat expects to\nreceive, on average, if it starts at the point uand follows its current policy\nthrough to the end of the maze. The average is taken over the stochasticchoices of actions speci \ufb01ed by the policy. In this case, the expected reward\nis simply equal to the weight. The learning procedure consists of two sep-arate steps: policy evaluation, in which\nw(u)is adjusted to improve the\npredictions of future reward, and policy improvement, in which m(u)is\nadjusted to increase the total reward.\nPolicy Evaluation\nIn policy evaluation, the rat keeps its policy \ufb01xed (i.e. keeps all the m(u)\n\ufb01xed) and uses temporal difference learning to determine the expected\ntotal future reward starting from each location. Suppose that, initially, therat has no preference for turning left or right, that is, m\n(u)=0 for all u,s o\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The thick lines arerunning averages of the weight values.\nthe probability of left and right turns is 1 /2 at all locations. By inspection\nof the possible places the rat can go, we \ufb01nd that the values of the states\nare\nv(B)=1\n2(0+5)=2.5,v ( C)=1\n2(0+2)=1,and\nv(A)=1\n2(v(B)+v(C))=1.75.(9.23)\nThese values are the average total future rewards that will be received\nduring exploration of the maze when actions are chosen using the randompolicy. The temporal difference learning rule of equation 9.10 can be usedto learn them. If the rat chooses action aat location uand ends up at\nlocation u\n/prime, the temporal difference rule modi \ufb01es the weight w(u)by critic learning rule\nw(u)\u2192w(u)+/epsilon1\u03b4 with \u03b4=ra(u)+v(u/prime)\u2212v(u). (9.24)\nHere, a location index usubstitutes for the time index t, and we only as-\nsociate a single weight w(u)with each state rather than a whole temporal\nkernel (this is equivalent to only using \u03c4=0 in equation 9.10). Figure 9.8\nshows the result of applying the temporal difference rule to the maze taskof\ufb01gure 9.7. After a fairly short adjustment period, the weights\nw(u)(and\nthus the predictions v(u))\ufb02uctuate around the correct values for this pol-\nicy, as given by equation 9.23. The size of the \ufb02uctuations could be reduced\nby making /epsilon1smaller, but at the expense of increasing the learning time.\nIn our earlier description of temporal difference learning, we included\nthe possibility that the reward delivery might be stochastic. Here, thatstochasticity is the result of a policy that makes use of the informationprovided by the critic. In the appendix, we discuss a Monte-Carlo inter-pretation of the terms in the temporal difference learning rule that justi \ufb01es\nusing its use.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nPolicy Improvement\nIn policy improvement, the expected total future rewards at the different\nlocations are used as surrogate immediate rewards. Suppose the rat takesaction aat location uand moves to location u\n/prime. The expected worth to\nthe rat of that action is the sum of the actual reward received and the re-wards that are expected to follow, which is r\na(u)+v(u/prime). The direct actor\nscheme of equation 9.22 uses the difference ra\u2212\u00afrbetween a sample of the\nworth of the action ( ra) and a reinforcement comparison term ( \u00afr), which\nmight be the average value over all the actions that can be taken. Policyimprovement uses r\na(u)+v(u/prime)as the equivalent of the sampled worth\nof the action, and v(u)as the average value across all actions that can be\ntaken at u. The difference between these is \u03b4=ra(u)+v(u/prime)\u2212v(u), which\nis exactly the same term as in policy evaluation (equation 9.24). The policyimprovement or actor learning rule is then actor learning rule\nm\na/prime(u)\u2192ma/prime(u)+/epsilon1/parenleftbig\u03b4aa/prime\u2212P[a/prime;u]/parenrightbig\u03b4 (9.25)\nfor all a/prime, where P[a/prime;u] is the probability of taking action a/primeat location u\ngiven by the softmax distribution of equation 9.11 or 9.12 with action value\nma/prime(u).\nTo look at this more concretely, consider the temporal difference error\nstarting from location u=A, using the true values of the locations given by\nequation 9.23 (i.e. assuming that policy evaluation is perfect). Dependingon the action,\n\u03b4takes the two values\n\u03b4=0+v(B)\u2212v(A)= 0.75 for a left turn\n\u03b4=0+v(C)\u2212v(A)=\u2212 0.75 for a right turn.\nThe learning rule of equation 9.25 increases the probability that the action\nwith\u03b4>0 is taken and decreases the probability that the action with \u03b4<0\nis taken. This increases the chance that the rat makes the correct turn (left)atAin the maze of \ufb01gure 9.7.\nAs the policy changes, the values, and therefore the temporal difference\nterms, change as well. However, because the values of all locations canonly increase if we choose better actions at those locations, this form ofpolicy improvement inevitably leads to higher values and better actions.This monotonic improvement (or at least non-worsening) of the expectedfuture rewards at all locations is proved formally in the dynamic program-ming theory of policy iteration for a class of problems called Markov de- Markov decision\nproblems cision problems (which includes the maze task), as discussed in the ap-\npendix.\nStrictly speaking, policy evaluation should be complete before a policy\nis improved. It is also most straightforward to improve the policy com-pletely before it is re-evaluated. A convenient (though not provably cor-rect) alternative is to interleave partial policy evaluation and policy im-provement steps. This is called the actor-critic algorithm.

The plots show the\ndevelopment over trials of the probability of choosing to go left, P[L;u],\nfor all the three locations. The model rat quickly learns to go left at lo-cation A and right at B. Learning at location C is slow because the ratlearns quickly that it is not worth going to C at all, so it rarely gets to trythe actions there. The algorithm makes an implicit choice of explorationstrategy.\nGeneralizations of Actor-Critic Learning\nThe full actor-critic model for solving sequential action tasks includesthree generalizations of the maze learner that we have presented. The \ufb01rst\ninvolves additional information that may be available at the different loca-tions. If, for example, sensory information is available at a location u,w e\nassociate a state vector u\n(u)with that location. The vector u(u)parame- state vector u\nterizes whatever information is available at location uthat might help the\nanimal decide which action to take. For example, the state vector mightrepresent a faint scent of food that the rat might detect in the maze task.When a state vector is available, the most straightforward generalization isto use the linear form\nv(u)=w\u00b7u(u)to de\ufb01ne the value at location u.T h e\nlearning rule for the critic (equation 9.24) is then generalized to include theinformation provided by the state vector,\nw\n\u2192w+/epsilon1\u03b4u(u), (9.26)\nwith\u03b4given given as in equation 9.24. The maze task we discussed could\nbe formulated in this way using what is called a unary representation, unary\nrepresentation u(A)=(1,0,0),u(B)=(0,1,0),a n d u(C)=(0,0,1).\nWe must also modify the actor learning rule to make use of the information\nprovided by the state vector. This is done by generalizing the action valuevector mto a matrix M, called an action matrix. Mhas as many columns action matrix M\nas there are components of uand as many rows as there are actions. Given\ninput u, action ais chosen at location uwith the softmax probability of\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n22 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\nequation 9.12, but using component aof the action value vector\nm=M\u00b7u(u)or ma=/summationdisplay\nbMabub(u). (9.27)\nIn this case, the learning rule 9.25 must be generalized to specify how to\nchange elements of the action matrix when action ais chosen at location\nuwith state vector u(u), leading to location u/prime. A rule similar to equa-\ntion 9.25 is appropriate, except that the change in Mdepends on the state\nvector u, three-term\ncovariance rule\nMa/primeb\u2192Ma/primeb+/epsilon1/parenleftbig\u03b4aa/prime\u2212P[a/prime;u]/parenrightbig\u03b4ub(u) (9.28)\nfor all a/prime, with \u03b4given again as in equation 9.24. This is called a three-term\ncovariance learning rule.\nWe can speculate about the biophysical signi \ufb01cance of the three-term co-\nvariance rule by interpreting \u03b4aa/primeas the output of cell a/primewhen action ais\nchosen (which has mean value is P[a/prime;u]) and interpreting uas the input\nto that cell. Compared with the Hebbian covariance rules studied in chap-ter 8, learning is gated by a third term, the reinforcement signal\n\u03b4. It has\nbeen suggested that the dorsal striatum, which is part of the basal ganglia, dorsal striatum\nbasal ganglia is involved in the selection and sequencing of actions. Terminals of axons\nprojecting from the substantia nigra pars compacta release dopamine ontosynapses within the striatum, suggesting that they might play such a gat-ing role. The activity of these dopamine neurons is similar to that of theVTA neurons discussed previously as a possible substrate for\n\u03b4.\nThe second generalization is to the case that rewards and punishments re-\nceived soon after an action are more important than rewards and punish-ments received later. One natural way to accommodate this is a techniquecalled exponential discounting. In computing the expected future reward, discounting\nthis amounts to multiplying a reward that will be received\n\u03c4time steps\nafter a given action by a factor \u03b3\u03c4, where 0 \u2264\u03b3\u22641 is the discounting factor.\nThe smaller \u03b3, the stronger the effect, i.e. the less important are tempo-\nrally distant rewards. Discounting has a major in \ufb02uence on the optimal\nbehavior in problems for which there are many steps to a goal. Expo-nential discounting can be accommodated within the temporal differenceframework by changing the prediction error\n\u03b4to\n\u03b4=ra(u)+\u03b3v(u/prime)\u2212v(u), (9.29)\nwhich is then used in the learning rules of equations 9.26 and 9.28.\nIn computing the amount to change a weight or action value, we de \ufb01ned\nthe worth of an action as the sum of the immediate reward delivered andthe estimate of the future reward arising from the next state. A \ufb01nal gen-\neralization of actor-critic learning comes from basing the learning rules onthe sum of the next two immediate rewards delivered and the estimate ofthe future reward from the next state but one, or the next three immediaterewards and the estimate from the next state but two, and so on. As in\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n9.4 Sequential Action Choice 23\ndiscounting, we can use a factor \u03bbto weight how strongly the expected\nfuture rewards from temporally distant points in the trial affect learning.Suppose that u\n(t)=u(u(t))is the state vector used at time step tof a\ntrial. Such generalized temporal difference learning can be achieved bycomputing new state vectors, de \ufb01ned by the recursive relation\n\u02dcu(t)=\u02dcu(t\u22121)+(1\u2212\u03bb)(u(t)\u2212\u02dcu(t\u22121)) (9.30)\nand using them instead of the original state vectors uin equations 9.26 and\n9.28. The resulting learning rule is called the TD (\u03bb)rule. Use of this rule TD(\u03bb)rule\nwith an appropriate value of \u03bbcan signi \ufb01cantly speed up learning.\nLearning the Water Maze\nAs an example of generalized reinforcement learning, we consider the wa-\nter maze task. This is a navigation problem in which rats are placed in alarge pool of milky water and have to swim around until they \ufb01nd a small\nplatform that is submerged slightly below the surface of the water. Theopaqueness of the water prevents them from seeing the platform directly,and their natural aversion to water (although they are competent swim-mers) motivates them to \ufb01nd the platform. After several trials, the rats\nlearn the location of the platform and swim directly to it when placed inthe water.\nFigure 9.10A shows the structure of the model, with the state vector u\nproviding input to the critic and a collection of 8 possible actions for theactor, which are expressed as compass directions. The components of u\nrepresent the activity of hippocampal place cells (which are discussed inchapter 1). Figure 9.10B shows the activation of one of the input units asa function of spatial position in the pool. The activity, like that of a placecell, is spatially restricted.\nDuring training, each trial consists of starting the model rat from a ran-\ndom location at the outside of the maze and letting it run until it \ufb01nds\nthe platform indicated by a small circle in the lower part of \ufb01gure 9.10C.\nAt that point a reward of 1 is provided. The reward is discounted with\n\u03b3=0.9975 to model the incentive for the rat to \ufb01nd the goal as quickly\nas possible. Figure 9.10C indicates the course of learning (trials 1, 5 and20) of the expected future reward as a function of location (upper \ufb01gures)\nand the policy (lower \ufb01gures with arrows). The lower \ufb01gures also show\nsample paths taken by the rat (lower \ufb01gures with wiggly lines). The \ufb01nal\nvalue function (at trial 20) is rather inaccurate, but, nevertheless, the pol-icy learned is broadly correct, and the paths to the platform are quite shortand direct.\nJudged by measures such as path length, initial learning proceeds in the\nmodel in a manner comparable to that of actual rats.

We introduced the Rescorla-Wagner or delta learning rule forclassical conditioning, together with its temporal difference extension, andindirect and direct actor rules for instrumental conditioning given imme-diate rewards. Finally, we presented the actor-critic version of the dynamicprogramming technique of policy iteration, evaluating policies using tem-poral difference learning and improving them using the direct actor learn-ing rule, based on surrogate immediate rewards from the evaluation step.In the appendix, we show more precisely how temporal difference learn-ing can be seen as a Monte-Carlo technique for performing policy iteration.\nAppendix\nMarkov Decision Problems\nMarkov decision problems offer a simple formalism for describing taskssuch as the maze. A Markov decision problem is comprised of states, ac-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n26 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\ntions, transitions, and rewards. The states, labeled by u, are what we called\nlocations in the maze task, and the actions, labeled by a, are the analogs of\nthe choices of directions to run. In the maze, each action taken at state\nuled uniquely and deterministically to a new state u/prime. Markov decision\nproblems generalize this to include the possibility that the transitions from\nud u et oa c t i o n amay be stochastic, leading to state u/primewith a transition\nprobability P[u/prime|u;a]./summationtext\nu/primeP[u/prime|u;a]=1 for all uand a, because the animal\nhas to end up somewhere. There can be absorbing states (like the shadedboxes in \ufb01gure 9.7), which are ufor which P[u\n|u;a]=1 for all actions a, i.e. absorbing state\nthere is no escape for the animal from these locations. Finally, the rewardsrcan depend both on the state ua n dt h ea c t i o ne x e c u t e d a, and they might\nbe stochastic. We write\n/angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketrightfor the mean reward in this case. For con-\nvenience, we only consider Markov chains that are \ufb01nite ( \ufb01nite numbers\nof actions and states), absorbing, (the animal always ends up in one of theabsorbing states), and in which the rewards are bounded. We also requirethat\n/angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketright=0 for all actions aat all absorbing states. The crucial Markov\nproperty is that, given the state at the current time step, the distribution Markov property\nover future states and rewards is independent of the past states.\nThe Bellman Equation\nThe task for a system or animal facing a Markov decision problem, starting\nin state uat time 0, is to choose a policy, denoted by M, that maximizes the\nexpected total future reward\nv\u2217(u)=max\nM/angbracketleftBigg\u221e/summationdisplay\nt=0ra(t)(u(t))/angbracketrightBigg\nu,M(9.31)\nwhere u(0)=u, actions a(t)are determined (either deterministically or\nstochastically) on the basis of the state u(t)according to policy M, and\nthe notation /angbracketleft/angbracketrightu,Mimplies taking an expectation over the actions and the\nstates to which they lead, starting at state uand using policy M.\nThe trouble with the sum in equation 9.31 is that the action a(0)at time\n0 affects not only /angbracketleftra(0)(u(0))/angbracketright,b u t ,b yi n \ufb02uencing the state of the sys-\ntem, also the subsequent rewards. It would seem that the animal wouldhave to consider optimizing whole sequences of actions, the number ofwhich grows exponentially with time. Bellman\u2019s (1957) insight was thatthe Markov property effectively solves this problem. He rewrote equa-tion 9.31 to separate the \ufb01rst and subsequent terms, and used a recursive\nprinciple for the latter. The Bellman equation is\nv\u2217(u)=max\na/braceleftBigg\n/angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketright+/summationdisplay\nu/primeP[u/prime|u;a]v\u2217(u/prime)/bracerightBigg\n(9.32)\nThis says that maximizing reward at urequires choosing the action athat\nmaximizes the sum of the mean immediate reward /angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketrightand the average\nof the largest possible values of all the states u/primeto which acan lead the\nsystem, weighted by their probabilities.\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n9.5 Chapter Summary 27\nPolicy Iteration\nThe actor-critic algorithm is a form of a dynamic programming technique\ncalled policy iteration. Policy iteration involves interleaved steps of policyevaluation (the role of the critic) and policy improvement (the role of theactor). Evaluation of policy Mrequires working out the values for all states\nu. We call these values\nvM(u),t or e \ufb02ect explicitly their dependence on the\npolicy. Each values is analogous to the quantity in 9.5. Using the sameargument that led to the Bellman equation, we can derive the recursiveformula\nvM(u)=/summationdisplay\naPM[a;u]/braceleftBigg\n/angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketright+/summationdisplay\nu/primeP[u/prime|u;a]vM(u/prime)/bracerightBigg\n(9.33)\nEquation 9.33 for all states uis a set of linear equations, that can be\nsolved by matrix inversion. Reinforcement learning can be interpreted asa stochastic Monte-Carlo method for performing this operation (Barto andDuff, 1994).\nTemporal difference learning uses an approximate Monte-Carlo method to Monte-Carlo\nmethod evaluate the right side of equation 9.33, and uses the difference between\nthis approximation and the estimate of\nvM(u)as the prediction error. The\n\ufb01rst idea underlying the method is that ra(u)+vM(u/prime)is a sample whose\nmean is exactly the right side of equation 9.33. The second idea is boot-strapping, using the current estimate\nv(u/prime)in place of vM(u/prime)in this sam-\nple. Thus ra(u)+v(u/prime)is used as a sampled approximation to vM(u), and\n\u03b4(t)=ra(u)+v(u/prime)\u2212v(u) (9.34)\nis used as a sampled approximation to the discrepancy vM(u)\u2212v(u)\nwhich is an appropriate error measure for training v(u)to equal vM(u).\nEvaluating and improving policies from such samples without learning\nP[u/prime|u;a] and /angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketrightdirectly is called an asynchronous, model-free, ap-\nproach to policy evaluation. It is possible to guarantee the convergence ofthe estimate\nvto its true value vMunder a set of conditions discussed in\nthe texts mentioned in the annotated bibliography.\nThe other half of policy iteration is policy improvement. This normally\nworks by \ufb01nding an action a\u2217that maximizes the expression in the curly\nbrackets in equation 9.33 and making the new PM[a\u2217;u]=1. One can show\nthat the new policy will be uniformly better than the old policy, making theexpected long-term reward at every state no smaller than the old policy,or equally large, if it is already optimal. Further, because the number ofdifferent policies is \ufb01nite, policy iteration is bound to converge.\nPerforming policy improvement like this requires knowledge of the tran-\nsition probabilities and mean rewards. Reinforcement learning againuses an asynchronous, model-free approach to policy improvement, us-ing Monte-Carlo samples. First, note that any policy M\n/primethat improves the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Classical Conditioning and Reinforcement Learning\naverage value\n/summationdisplay\naPM/prime[u;a]/braceleftBigg\n/angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketright+/summationdisplay\nu/primeP[u/prime|u;a]vM(u/prime)/bracerightBigg\n. (9.35)\nfor every state uis guaranteed to be a better policy. The idea for a single\nstate uis to treat equation 9.35 rather like equation 9.15, except replacing\nthe average immediate reward /angbracketleftra/angbracketrightthere by an effective average immedi-\nate reward /angbracketleftra(u)/angbracketright+/summationtext\nu/primeP[u/prime|u;a]vM(u/prime)to take long term as well as cur-\nrent reward into account. By the same reasoning as above, ra(u)+v(u/prime)\nis used as an approximate Monte-Carlo sample of the effective immediate\nreward, and v(u)as the equivalent of the reinforcement comparison term\n\u00afr. This leads directly to the actor learning rule of equation 9.25.\nNote that there is an interaction between the stochasticity in the rein-\nforcement learning versions of policy evaluation and policy improvement.This means that it is not known whether the two together are guaranteedto converge. One could perform temporal difference policy evaluation(which can be proven to converge) until convergence before attemptingpolicy improvement, and this would be sure to work.\n9.6 Annotated Bibliography\nDickinson (1980) ;Mackintosh (1983) ;Shanks (1995) review animal and\nhuman conditioning behavior, including alternatives to Rescorla & Wag-ner\u2019s (1972) rule.

Grossberg and col-leagues (see Grossberg, 1982, 1987 & 1988) have developed a sophisticatedmathematical model of conditioning, including aspects of opponent pro-cessing (Konorksi, 1967; Solomon & Corbit, 1974), which puts predictionof the absence of reward (or the presence of punishment) on a more equalfooting with prediction of the presence of reward, and develops aspectsof how animals pay differing amounts of attention to stimuli.

Sensory in-formation is typically represented in multiple regions, the visual systembeing a prime example, with the nature of the representation shifting pro-gressively along the sensory pathway. In previous chapters, we discusshow such representations can be generated by neural circuitry and devel-oped by activity-dependent plasticity. In this chapter, we study neuralrepresentations from a computational perspective, asking what goals areserved by particular representations and how appropriate representationsmight be developed on the basis of input statistics.\nConstructing new representations of, or re-representing, sensory input is re-representation\nimportant because sensory receptors often deliver information in a formthat is unsuitable for higher level cognitive tasks. For example, roughly10\n8photoreceptors provide a pixelated description of the images that ap-\npear on our retinas. A list of the membrane potentials of each of thesephotoreceptors is a bulky and awkward representation of the visual worldfrom which it is dif \ufb01cult to identify directly the underlying causes of vi-\nsual images, such as the objects and people we typically see. Instead, theinformation provided by photoreceptor outputs is processed in a series ofstages involving increasingly sophisticated representations of the visualworld. In this chapter, we consider how to specify and learn these morecomplex and useful representations.\nThe key to constructing useful representations lies in determining the\nstructure of visual images and the constraints imposed on them by thenatural world. Images have causes, such as objects with given locations,orientations, and scales, illuminated by particular lighting schemes, and\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n2 Representational Learning\nobserved from particular viewing locations and directions. Because of this,\nthe set of possible pixelated activities arising from natural scenes is richlystructured. Sophisticated representations of images arise from ways ofcharacterizing this structure.\nIn this chapter, we discuss one approach to identifying the structure in\nnatural stimuli and using it as a basis for constructing useful and ef \ufb01cient\nrepresentations. The basic goal in the models we discuss is to determinethe causes that give rise to stimuli. These are assumed to be the sources ofstructure in the sensory input data. Causal representations are appropriatebecause inferences, decisions, and actions are typically based on underly-ing causes. In more abstract terms, causes are the natural coordinates fordescribing complex stimuli such as images. To account for the inevitablevariability that arises when considering natural stimuli, many of the mod-els we discuss are probabilistic, specifying the probabilities that variouscauses underlie particular stimuli.\nCausal Models\nFigure 10.1A provides a simple example of structured data that suggestsunderlying causes. In this case, each input is characterized by a two com-ponent vector u\n=(u1,u2). A collection of sample inputs that we wish to input vector u\nrepresent in terms of underlying causes is indicated by the 40 crosses in\ufb01gure 10.1A. These inputs are drawn from a probability density p[u] that\nwe call the input distribution. Clearly, there are two clusters of points in input distribution\np[u] \ufb01gure 10.1A, one centered near\n(0,1)and the other near (1,0). Many pro-\ncesses can generate such clustered data. For example, u1and u2might\nrepresent two characterizations of the voltage recorded on an extracellu-lar electrode in response to an action potential. Interpreted in this way,these data suggest that we are looking at spikes produced by two neurons(called A and B), which are the underlying causes of the two clusters seenin\ufb01gure 10.1A. A more compact and causal description of the data can\nbe provided by a single output variable\nvthat takes the value A or B for causev\neach data point, representing which of the two neurons was responsible\nfor this input. The variable v, which we associate with a cause, is some-\ntimes called a hidden or latent variable because, although it underlies u, hidden or latent\nvariable its value cannot necessarily be determined unambiguously from u.F o r\nexample, it may be impossible to determine de \ufb01nitively the value of vfor\nan input unear the boundary between the two clusters in \ufb01gure 10.1A.\nThe ultimate goal of a causal model is recognition, in which the model tells recognition\nus something about the causes underlying a particular input.

In either case, the output vis taken as the model\u2019s re-representation\nof the input.\nWe consider models that infer causes in an unsupervised manner. In\nthe example of \ufb01gure 10.1A, this means that no indication is given about\nwhich neuron \ufb01red which action potential. The only information available\nis the statistical structure of the input data that is apparent in the \ufb01gure. In\nthe absence of supervisory information or even reinforcement, causes arejudged by their ability to explain and reproduce, statistically, the inputsthey are designed to represent. This is achieved by constructing a gener-ative model that can be used to create synthetic input data from assumed generative model\ncauses. The generative model has a number of parameters that we col-lectively represent by\nG, and an overall structure or form that determines parameters G\nhow these parameters specify a distribution over the inputs. The param-\neters are adjusted until the distributions of synthetic and real inputs areas similar as possible. If the \ufb01nal statistical match is good, the causes are\njudged trustworthy, and the model can be used as a basis for recognition.\nGenerative Models\nTo illustrate the concept of a generative model, we construct one for the\ndata in \ufb01gure 10.1A. We begin by specifying the proportions (also known\nas mixing proportions) of action potentials that come from the two neu- mixing proportions\nrons. These are written as P[\nv;G] with v=Ao rB . P[v;G], which is called\nthe prior distribution over causes, is the probability that a given spike is prior P [v;G]\ngenerated by neuron vin the absence of any knowledge about the input u\nassociated with that spike. This might re \ufb02ect the fact that one of the neu-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n4 Representational Learning\nrons has a higher \ufb01ring rate than the other, for example. The two prior\nprobabilities represent two of the model parameters contained in the list\nG,P[v;G]=\u03b3vforv=A and B. These parameters are not independent\nbecause they must sum to one. We start by assigning them random valuesconsistent with this constraint.\nTo continue the construction of the generative model, we need to assume\nsomething about the distribution of uvalues arising from the action poten-\ntials generated by each neuron. An examination of \ufb01gure 10.1A suggests\nthat Gaussian distributions (with the same variance in both dimensions)might be appropriate. We write the probability density of uvalues given\nthat neuron\nv\ufb01red as p[u|v;G], and set it equal to a Gaussian distribu- generative\ndistribution\np[u|v;G]tion with a mean and variance that, initially, we guess. The parameter\nlistGnow contains the prior probabilities for neurons A and B to \ufb01re,\n\u03b3v, and the means and variances of the Gaussian distributions over ufor\nv=A and B, which we label gvand/Sigma1vrespectively. Note that we use\n/Sigma1vfor the variance of cluster v, not its standard deviation, and also that\neach cluster is characterized by a single variance because we only considercircularly symmetric Gaussian distributions.\nFigure 10.1B shows synthetic data points (crosses) generated by this\nmodel. To create each point, we set\nv=A with probability P[v=A;G]( o r\notherwise set v=B) and then generated a point urandomly from the distri-\nbution p[u|v;G]. This generative model clearly has the capacity to create\na data distribution with two clusters similar to the one in \ufb01gure 10.1A.\nHowever, the values of the parameters Gused in \ufb01gure 10.1B are obvi-\nously inappropriate. They must be adjusted by a learning procedure thatmatches, as accurately as possible, the distribution of synthetic data pointsin\ufb01gure 10.1B to the actual input distribution in \ufb01gure 10.1A. We describe\nhow this is done in a following section. After optimization, as seen in \ufb01g-\nure 10.1C, synthetic data points generated by the model (crosses) overlapwell with the actual data points seen in \ufb01gure 10.1A.\nIn summary, generative models are de \ufb01ned by a prior probability distri-\nbution over causes, P[\nv;G], and a generative distribution for inputs given\neach particular cause, p[u|v;G], which collectively depend on a list of pa-\nrameters G. Sometimes, we consider inputs that are discrete, in which\ncase, following our convention for writing probabilities and probabilitydensities, the probability distribution for the inputs is written as P[u] and\nthe generative distribution as P[u\n|v;G]. Alternatively, the causal vari-\nables can be continuous, and the generative model then has the priorprobability density p[\nv;G]. Sometimes, the relationship between causes\nand synthetic inputs in the generative model is deterministic rather thanbeing stochastic. This corresponds to setting p[u\n|v;G]t oa \u03b4function,\np[u|v;G]=\u03b4(u\u2212f(v;G)), where fis a vector of functions. Causes are\nsometimes described by a vector vinstead of a single variable v. A general\nproblem that arises in the example of \ufb01gure 10.1 is determining the num-\nber of possible causes, i.e. the number of clusters. Probabilistic methodscan be used to make statistical inferences about the number of clusters in\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.1 Introduction 5\nthe data, but they lie beyond the scope of this text.\nThe distribution of synthetic data points in \ufb01gures 10.1B and 10.1C is de-\nscribed by the density p[u;G] that the generative model synthesizes an in-\nput with the value u. This density can be computed from the prior P[v;G]\nand the conditional density p[u|v;G] that de \ufb01ne the generative model, marginal\ndistribution\np[u;G] p[u;G]=/summationdisplay\nvP[v;G]p[u|v;G]. (10.1)\nThe process of summing over all causes is called marginalization, and\np[u;G] is called the marginal distribution over u. A si nc h a p t e r8 ,w e\nuse the additional argument Gto distinguish the distribution of synthetic\ninputs produced by the generative model, p[u;G], from the distribution of\nactual inputs, p[u]. The process of adjusting the parameters Gto make the\ndistributions of synthetic and real input data points match, corresponds tomaking the marginal distribution p[u\n;G] approximate, as closely as pos-\nsible, the distribution p[u] from which the input data points are drawn.\nBefore we discuss the procedures used to adjusting the parameters of thegenerative model to their optimal values, we describe how a model ofrecognition can be constructed on the basis of the generative description.\nRecognition Models\nOnce the optimal generative model has been constructed, the culmination\nof representational learning is recognition, in which new input data areinterpreted in terms of the causes established during training. In prob-abilistic recognition models, this amounts to determining the probabilitythat cause\nvis associated with input u.\nIn the model of \ufb01gure 10.1, and in many of the models discussed in this\nchapter, recognition falls directly out of the generative model. The proba-bility of cause\nvgiven input uisP[v|u;G], which is the statistical inverse\nof the distribution p[u|v;G] that de \ufb01nes the generative model. P[v|u;G]\nis called the posterior distribution over causes or the recognition distribu-tion. Using Bayes theorem, it can be expressed in terms of the distributionsthat de \ufb01ne the generative model as recognition\ndistribution\nP[\nv|u;G]P[v|u;G]=p[u|v;G]P[v;G]\np[u;G]. (10.2)\nIn the example of \ufb01gure 10.1, equation 10.2 can be used to determine that\nthe point indicated by the \ufb01lled square in \ufb01gure 10.1C has probability\nP[v=A|u;G]=0.8 of being associated with neuron A and P[v=B|u;G]=\n0.2 of being associated with neuron B.\nAlthough equation 10.2 provides a direct solution of the recognition prob- invertible and\nnon-invertible\nmodelslem, it is sometimes impractically dif \ufb01cult to compute the right side of\nthis equation. We call models in which the recognition distribution can be\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n6 Representational Learning\ncomputed from equation 10.2, invertible, and those in which it cannot be\ncomputed tractably, non-invertible. In the latter case, recognition is basedon an approximate recognition distribution. That is, recognition is based approximate\nrecognitiondistribution\nQ[\nv;u,W]on a function Q[v;u,W], expressed in terms of a set of parameters collec-\ntively labeled W, that provides an approximation to the exact recognition\ndistribution P[v|u;G]. Like generative models, approximate recognition\nmodels can have different structures and parameters. In many cases, aswe discuss in the next section, the best approximation of the recognitiondistribution comes from adjusting\nWthrough an optimization procedure.\nOnce this is done, Q[v;u,W] provides the model\u2019s estimate of the prob-\nability that input uis associated with cause v, performing the same role\nthat P[v|u;G] does for invertible models.\nThe choice of a particular structure for a generative model re \ufb02ects our no-\ntions and prejudices, collectively referred to as heuristics, about the prop-erties of the causes that underlie a set of input data. Usually, the heuristicsconsist of biases toward certain types of representations, which are im-posed through the choice of the prior distribution p[\nv;G]. For example,\nwe may want the identi \ufb01ed causes to be mutually independent (which factorial coding\nleads to a factorial code) or sparse, or of lower dimension than the inputsparse coding\ndata. Many heuristics can be formalized using the information theoreticdimensionality\nreductionideas we discuss in chapter 4.\nOnce a causal model has been constructed, it is possible to check whether\nthe biases imposed by the prior distribution of the generative model haveactually been realized. This is done by examining the distribution ofcauses produced by the recognition model in response to actual data. Thisdistribution should match the prior distribution over the causes, and thusshare its desired properties, such as mutual independence. If the prior dis-tribution of the generative model does not match the actual distribution ofcauses produced by the recognition model, this is an indication that thedesired heuristic does not apply accurately to the input data.\nExpectation Maximization\nThere are various ways to adjust the parameters of a generative model to\noptimize the match between the synthetic data it generates and the actualinput data. In this chapter (except for one case), we use a generalizationof an approach called expectation maximization or EM. The general the- EM\nory of EM is discussed in detail in the next section but, as an introductionto the method, we apply it here to the example of \ufb01gure 10.1. Recall that\nthe problem of optimizing the generative model in this case involves ad-justing the mixing proportions, means, and variances of the two Gaussiandistributions until the clusters of synthetic data points in \ufb01gure 10.1B and\nC match the clusters of actual data points in \ufb01gure 10.1A.\nThe parameters g\nvand/Sigma1vforv=A and B of the Gaussian distributions\nof the generative model should equal the means and variances of the data\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.1 Introduction 7\npoints associated with each cluster in \ufb01gure 10.1A. If we knew which clus-\nter each input point belonged to, it would be a simple matter to computethese means and variances and construct the optimal generative model.Similarly, we could set\n\u03b3v, the prior probability of a given spike being a\nmember of cluster v, equal to the fraction of data points assigned to that\ncluster. Of course, we do know the cluster assignments of the input points;that would amount to knowing the answer to the recognition problem.However, we can make an informed guess about which point belongs towhich cluster on the basis of equation 10.2. In other words, the recog-nition distribution P[\nv|u;G] of equation 10.2 provides us with our best\ncurrent guess about the cluster assignment, and this can be used in placeof the actual knowledge about which neuron produces which spike. Therecognition distribution P[\nv|u;G] is thus used to assign the data point u\nto cluster vin a probabilistic manner.\nIn EM algorithm, the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution cor-\nresponding to cause vare set equal to a weighted mean and variance of all\nthe data points, with the weight for point uequal to the current estimate\nP[v|u;G] of the probability that it belongs to cluster v. In this context, the\nrecognition probability P[v|u;G] is also called the responsibility of vforu. responsibility\nA similar argument is applied to the mixing proportions, resulting in theequations\n\u03b3v=/angbracketleftP[v|u;G]/angbracketright,gv=/angbracketleftP[v|u;G]u/angbracketright\n\u03b3v,/Sigma1 v=/angbracketleftP[v|u;G]|u\u2212gv|2/angbracketright\n2\u03b3v.\n(10.3)\nThe angle brackets indicate averages over all the input data points. The\nfactors of \u03b3vdividing the last two expressions correct for the fact that the\nnumber of points in cluster vis only expected to be \u03b3vtimes the total num-\nber of input data points, whereas the full averages denoted by the bracketsinvolve dividing by the total number of data points.\nThe full EM algorithm consists of two phases that are applied in alterna-\ntion. In the E (or expectation) phase, the responsibilities P[\nv|u;G] are cal- E phase\nculated from equation 10.2. In the M (or maximization) phase, the genera-M phase\ntive parameters Gare modi \ufb01ed according to equation 10.3. The process of\ndetermining the responsibilities and then averaging according to them re-peats because the responsibilities change when\nGis modi \ufb01ed. Figure 10.2\nshows intermediate results at three different times during the running ofthe EM procedure starting from the generative model in \ufb01gure 10.1B and\nresulting in the \ufb01t shown in \ufb01gure 10.1C.\nThe EM procedure for optimizing the generative model in the example\nof\ufb01gure 10.1 makes intuitive sense, but it is not obvious that it will con-\nverge to an optimal model. Indeed, the process appears circular becausethe generative model de \ufb01nes the responsibilities used to construct itself.\nHowever, there are rigorous theoretical arguments justifying its use, whichwe discuss in the following section. These provide a framework for per-forming unsupervised learning in a wide class of models.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n8 Representational Learning\n\u22121012\u22121012\nB\nBB\nBB BB\nBBB\nBB\nB\nBBBA\nAAB\nAABB\nAB\n\u22121012\u22121012\nBBB\nBBBBB\nB\nBBB\nBBB\nB\nBBBBAAA\nA AA\nAAAA\nAA\nAAAAA\nAAAA\nB\n\u22121012\u22121012\nBBB\nBBBBBB\nBBB\nBBB\nB\nBBBBAAA\nAAA\nAAAAAA\nAAAAA\nAAA\n/BT /BU /BV/D9/BE/D9/BD\n/D9/BD\n/D9/BD\n/CX/D8/CT/D6/CP/D8/CX/D3/D2 /BE /CX/D8/CT/D6/CP/D8/CX/D3/D2 /BH /CX/D8/CT/D6/CP/D8/CX/D3/D2 /BH/BC\nFigure 10.2: EM for clustering.

The assignment of labels for thetwo Gaussians (i.e. which is \u2018A\u2019 and which \u2018B\u2019) is arbitrary, depending on initialconditions.\n10.2 Density Estimation\nThe process of matching the distribution p[u;G] produced by the gen-\nerative model to the actual input distribution p[u] is a form of density\nestimation. This technique is discussed in chapter 8 in connection with the density estimation\nBoltzmann machine. As mentioned in the introduction, the parameters G\nof the generative model are \ufb01t to the training data by minimizing the dis-\ncrepancy between the probability density of the input data p[u] and the\nmarginal probability density of equation 10.1. This discrepancy is mea-sured using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (chapter 4)\nD\nKL(p[u],p[u;G])=/integraldisplay\ndup[u]l np[u]\np[u;G]\n\u2248\u2212/angbracketleftbig\nlnp[u;G]/angbracketrightbig+K (10.4)\nwhere Kis a term proportional to the entropy of the distribution p[u] that\nis independent of G. In the second line, we have approximated the integral\nover all uvalues weighted by p[u] by the average over input data points\ngenerated from the distribution p[u]. We assume there are suf \ufb01cient input\ndata to justify this approximation.\nEquation 10.4 and the following discussion are similar to our treatment of\nlearning in the Boltzmann machine discussed in chapter 8. As in that case,equation 10.4 implies that minimizing the discrepancy between p[u] and\np[u\n;G] amounts to maximizing the log likelihood that the training data\ncould have been created by the generative model, log likelihood L (G)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.2 Density Estimation 9\nL(G)=/angbracketleftbig\nlnp[u;G]/angbracketrightbig. (10.5)\nHere L(G)is the average log likelihood, and the method is known as max- maximum\nlikelihood density\nestimationimum likelihood density estimation. A theorem due to Shannon describes\ncircumstances under which the generative model that maximizes the like-lihood over input data also provides the most ef \ufb01cient way of coding those\ndata, so density estimation is closely related to optimal coding.\nTheory of EM\nAlthough stochastic gradient ascent can be used to adjust the parametersof the generative model to maximize the likelihood in equation 10.5 (asit was for the Boltzmann machine), the EM algorithm discussed in theintroduction is an alternative procedure that is often more ef \ufb01cient. We\nalready applied this algorithm, on intuitive grounds, to the example of\ufb01gure 10.1, but we now present a more general and rigorous discussion.\nThis is based on the connection of EM with maximization of the function\nF(Q,G)\nF(Q,G)=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u]l np[v,u;G]\nQ[v;u]/angbracketrightBigg\n(10.6)\nwhere joint distribution\np[v,u;G]\np[v,u;G]=p[u|v;G]P[v;G]=P[v|u;G]p[u;G] (10.7)\nis the joint probability distribution over both causes and inputs speci \ufb01ed\nby the model. In equation 10.6, Q[v;u] is any non-negative function of the\ndiscrete argument vand continuous input uthat satis \ufb01es\n/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u]=1 (10.8)\nfor all u. Although, in principle, Q[v;u] can be any function, we consider\nit to be an approximate recognition distribution. For some non-invertiblemodels, we express Qin terms of a set of parameters\nWand write it as\nQ[v;u,W].\nFis a useful quantity because, by a rearrangement of terms, it can be\nwritten as the difference of the average log likelihood and the averageKullback-Leibler divergence between Q[\nv;u] and p[v|u;G]. This is done\nby substituting the second equality of equation 10.7 into equation 10.6 andusing 10.8 and the de \ufb01nition of the Kullback-Leibler divergence to obtain\nF(Q,G)=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u]/parenleftbigg\nlnp[u;G]+lnP[v|u;G]\nQ[v;u]/parenrightbigg/angbracketrightBigg\n=/angbracketleftbig\nlnp[u;G]/angbracketrightbig\u2212/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u]/parenleftbigg\nlnQ[v;u]\nP[v|u;G]/parenrightbigg/angbracketrightBigg\n=L(G)\u2212/angbracketleftbig\nDKL(Q[v;u],P[v|u;G])/angbracketrightbig. (10.9)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n10 Representational Learning\nBecause the Kullback-Leibler divergence is never negative,\nL(G)\u2265F(Q,G), (10.10)\nand because DKL=0 only if the two distributions being compared are\nidentical, this inequality is saturated, becoming an equality, only if\nQ[v;u]=P[v|u;G]. (10.11)\nThe negative of Fis related to an important quantity in statistical physics\ncalled the free energy. free energy \u2212F\nExpressions 10.9, 10.10, and 10.11 are critical to the operation of EM. The\ntwo phases of EM are concerned with separately maximizing (or at leastincreasing)\nFwith respect to its two arguments. When Fincreases, this\nincreases a lower bound on the log likelihood of the input data (equation10.10). In the M phase,\nFis increased with respect to G, keeping Qcon-\nstant. For the generative model of \ufb01gure 10.1, it is possible to maximize\nFwith respect to Gin a single step, through equation 10.3. For other\ngenerative models, this may require multiple steps that perform gradientascent on\nF. In the E phase, Fis increased with respect to Q, keeping G\nconstant. From equation 10.9, we see that increasing Fby changing Qis\nequivalent to reducing the average Kullback-Leibler divergence between\nQ[v;u] and P[v|u;G]. The E phase can proceed in at least three possible\nways, depending on the nature of the generative model being considered.We discuss these separately.\nInvertible Models\nIf the causal model being considered is invertible, the E step of EM sim-\nply consists of solving equation 10.2 for the recognition distribution, andsetting Qequal to the resulting P[\nv|u;G] as in equation 10.11. This max-\nimizes Fwith respect to Qby setting the Kullback-Leibler term to zero,\nand it makes the function Fequal to L(G), the average log likelihood of\nthe data points. However, the EM algorithm for maximizing Fis not ex-\nactly the same as likelihood maximization. This is because the function Q\nis held constant during the M phase while the parameters Gare modi \ufb01ed.\nAlthough Fis equal to Lat the beginning of the M phase, exact equality\nceases to be true as soon as Gis modi \ufb01ed, making P[v|u;G] different from\nQ.Fis equal to L(G)again only after the update of Qduring the follow-\ning E phase. At this point, L(G)must have increased since the last E phase,\nbecause Fhas increased. This shows that the log likelihood increases\nmonotonically during EM until the process converges, even though EMis not identical to likelihood maximization. One advantage of EM overlikelihood maximization through gradient methods is that this monotonic-ity holds even if the successive changes to\nGare large. Thus, large steps\ntoward the maximum can be taken during each M cycle of modi \ufb01cation.\nOf course, the log likelihood may have multiple maxima, in which case\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.2 Density Estimation 11\nneither gradient ascent nor EM is guaranteed to \ufb01nd the globally optimal\nsolution. Also, the process of maximizing a function one coordinate ata time (which is called coordinate ascent) is subject to local maxima thatother optimization methods avoid (we encounter an example of this laterin the chapter).\nFor the example of \ufb01gure 10.1, the joint probability over causes and inputs\nis\np[\nv,u;G]=\u03b3v\n2\u03c0/Sigma1vexp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212|u\u2212gv|2\n2/Sigma1v/parenrightbigg\n, (10.12)\nand thus\nF=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u]/parenleftbigg\nln/parenleftBig\u03b3v\n2\u03c0/parenrightBig\n\u2212ln/Sigma1v\u2212|u\u2212gv|2\n2/Sigma1v\u2212lnQ[v;u]/parenrightbigg/angbracketrightBigg\n.(10.13)\nThe E phase amounts to computing P[v|u;G] from equation 10.2 and set-\nting Qequal to it, as in equation 10.11. The M phase involves maximizing\nFwith respect to Gfor this Q. We leave it as an exercise for the reader\nto show that maximizing equation 10.13 with respect to the parameters \u03b3v\n(taking into account the constraint/summationtext\nv\u03b3v=1),gv, and/Sigma1vleads to the rules\nof equation 10.3.\nNon-Invertible Deterministic Models\nIf the generative model is non-invertible, the E phase of the EM algorithm\nis more complex than simply setting Qequal to P[v|u;G], because it is not\npractical to compute the recognition distribution exactly. The steps takenduring the E phase depend on whether the approximation to the inverseof the model is deterministic or probabilistic, although the basic argumentis the same in either case.\nThe recognition process based on a deterministic approximation results in\na prediction\nv(u)of the cause underlying input u. In terms of the function\nF, this amounts to retaining only the single term v=v(u)in the sum in\nequation 10.6, and for this single term Q[v(u);u]=1. Thus, in this case\nFis a functional of the function v(u), and a function of the parameters G,\ngiven by\nF(Q,G)=F(v(u),G)=/angbracketleftlnP[v(u),u;G]/angbracketright. (10.14)\nThe M phase of EM consists, as always, of maximizing this expression\nwith respect to G. During the E phase we try to \ufb01nd the function v(u)\nthat maximizes F. Because vis varied during the optimization procedure,\nthe approach is sometimes called a variational method. The E and M steps variational method\nmake intuitive sense; we are \ufb01nding the input-output relationship that\nmaximizes the probability that the generative model would have simulta-neously produced the cause\nv(u)and the input u.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12 Representational Learning\nThe approximation that the recognition model is deterministic can be\nrather drastic, making it dif \ufb01cult, in the case of visual representations for\nexample, to account for psychophysical aspects of sensory processing. Wealso encounter a case later in the chapter where this approximation re-quires us to introduce constraints on\nG.\nNon-Invertible Probabilistic Models\nThe alternative to using a deterministic approximate recognition model is\nto treat Q[v;u] as a full probability distribution over vfor each input ex-\nample u.I nt h i sc a s e ,w ec h o o s eas p e c i \ufb01c functional form for Q, expressed\nin terms of a set of parameters collectively labeled W. Thus, we write the\napproximate recognition distribution as Q[v;u,W].Fcan now be treated\nas a function of W, rather than of Q, so we write it as F(W,G). As in all\ncases, the M phase of EM consists of maximizing F(W,G)with respect to\nG. The E phase now consists of maximizing F(W,G)with respect to W.\nThis has the effect of making Q[v;u,W] as similar as possible to P[v|u;G],\nin the sense that the KL divergence between them, averaged over the inputdata, is minimized (see equation 10.9).\nBecause each E and M step separately increases the value of\nF,t h eE M\nalgorithm is guaranteed to converge to at least a local maximum of F(ex-\ncept in the rare cases that coordinate ascent induces extra local maxima).In general, this does not correspond to a local maximum of the likelihoodfunction, because Qis not exactly equal to the actual recognition distribu-\ntion (that is,\nFis only guaranteed to be a lower bound on L(G)). Never-\ntheless, a good generative model should be obtained if the lower bound istight.\nIt is not necessary to maximize F\n(W,G)completely with respect to W\nand then Gduring successive E and M phases. Instead, gradient ascent\nsteps that modify WandGby small amounts can be taken in alternation,\nin which case the E and M phases effectively overlap.\n10.3 Causal Models for Density Estimation\nIn this section, we present a number of models in which representationallearning is achieved through density estimation. The mixture of Gaus-sians and factor analysis models that we discuss are examples of invertiblegenerative models with probabilistic recognition. Principal componentsanalysis is a limiting case of factor analysis with deterministic recogni-tion. We consider two other models with deterministic recognition, in-dependent components analysis, which is invertible, and sparse coding,which is non-invertible. Our \ufb01nal example, the Helmholtz machine, is\nnon-invertible with probabilistic recognition. The Boltzmann machine,\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.3 Causal Models for Density Estimation 13\ndiscussed in chapters 7 and 8, is an additional example that is closely re-\nlated to the causal models discussed here. We summarize and interpretgeneral properties of representations derived from causal models at theend of the chapter. The table in the appendix summarizes the generativeand recognition distributions and the learning rules for all the models wediscuss.\nMixture of Gaussians\nThe model applied in the introduction to the data in \ufb01gure 10.1A is a\nmixture of Gaussians model. That example involves two causes and twoGaussian distributions, but we now generalize this to N\nvcauses, each as-\nsociated with a separate Gaussian distribution. The model is de \ufb01ned by\nthe probability distributions\nP[v;G]=\u03b3vand p[u|v;G]=N(u;gv,/Sigma1v) (10.15)\nwhere vtakes Nvvalues representing the different causes and, for an Nu\ncomponent input vector,\nN(u;g,/Sigma1)=1\n(2\u03c0/Sigma1)Nu/2exp/parenleftbigg\n\u2212|u\u2212g|2\n2/Sigma1/parenrightbigg\n(10.16)\nis a Gaussian distribution with mean gand variances for the individual\ncomponents equal to /Sigma1. The function F(Q,G)for this model is given\nby an expression similar to equation 10.13 (with slightly different factors if\nNu/negationslash=2), leading to the M-phase learning rules given in the appendix. Once\nthe generative model has been optimized, the recognition distribution isconstructed from equation 10.2 as\nP[\nv|u;G]=\u03b3vN(u;gv,/Sigma1v)/summationtext\nv/prime\u03b3v/primeN(u;gv/prime,/Sigma1v/prime). (10.17)\nK-Means Algorithm\nA special case of mixture of Gaussians can be derived in the limit that the\nvariances of the Gaussians are equal and tend toward 0, /Sigma1v=/Sigma1\u21920. We\ndiscuss this limit for two clusters as in \ufb01gure 10.1. When /Sigma1is extremely\nsmall, the recognition distribution P[v|u;G] of equation 10.17 degenerates\nbecause it takes essentially two values, 0 or 1, depending on whether uis\ncloser to one cluster or the other. This provides a hard, rather than a prob-abilistic or soft, classi \ufb01cation of u. In the degenerate case, EM consists of\nchoosing two random values for the centers of the two cluster distribu-tions, \ufb01nding all the inputs uthat are closest to a given center g\nv, and then\nmoving gvto the average of these points. This is called the K-means al-\ngorithm (with K=2 for two clusters). The mixing proportions \u03b3vdo not\nplay an important role for the K-means algorithm. New input points are\nrecognized as belonging to the clusters to which they are closest.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14 Representational Learning\nFactor Analysis\nThe causes in the mixture of Gaussians model are discrete. Factor analysis\nuses a continuous vector of causes, v, drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\nAs in the mixture of Gaussians model, the distribution over inputs given acause is Gaussian. However, the mean of this Gaussian is a linear functionofv, rather than a parameter of the model. We assume that the distribu-\ntion p[u] has zero mean (non-zero means can be accommodated simply by\nshifting the input data). Then, the de \ufb01ning distributions for factor analysis\nare\np[v\n;G]=N(v;000,1)and p[u|v;G]=N(u;G\u00b7v,/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1) (10.18)\nwhere, the extension of equation 10.16 expressed in terms of the mean g\nand covariance matrix /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1is\nN(u;g,/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1)=1\n((2\u03c0)Nu|det/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1|)1/2exp/parenleftbigg\n\u22121\n2(u\u2212g)\u00b7/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1\u22121\u00b7(u\u2212g)/parenrightbigg\n.\n(10.19)\nThe expression |det/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1|indicates the absolute value of the determinant of\n/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1. In factor analysis, /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1is taken to be diagonal, /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1=diag(/Sigma11,...,/Sigma1 Nu)\n(see the Mathematical Appendix), with all the diagonal elements nonzero,\nso its inverse is simply /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1\u22121=diag(1//Sigma11,..., 1//Sigma1 Nu)and|det/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1|=\n/Sigma11/Sigma12.../Sigma1 Nu.\nAccording to equation 10.18, the individual components of vare mutu-\nally independent. Furthermore, because /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1is diagonal, any correlations\nbetween the components of umust arise from the mean values G\u00b7vof the\ngenerative distribution. The model requires vto have fewer dimensions\nthan u(Nv<Nu). In terms of heuristics, factor analysis seeks a relatively\nsmall number of independent causes that account, in a linear manner, forcollective Gaussian structure in the inputs.\nThe recognition distribution for factor analysis has the Gaussian form\np[v\n|u;G]=N(v;W\u00b7u,/Psi1/Psi1/Psi1) (10.20)\nwhere expressions for Wand/Psi1/Psi1/Psi1are given in the appendix. These do not\ndepend on the input u, so factor analysis involves a linear relation between\nthe input and the mean of the recognition distribution. EM, as appliedto an invertible model, can be used to adjust\nG=(G,/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1)on the basis of\nthe input data. The resulting learning rules are given in the table in theappendix.\nIn this case, we can understand the goal of density estimation in an addi-\ntional way. By direct calculation, as in equation 10.1, the marginal distri-bution for uis\np[u\n;G]=N(u;000,G\u00b7GT+/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1) (10.21)\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.3 Causal Models for Density Estimation 15\nwhere [ GT]ab=[G]baand [ G\u00b7GT]ab=/summationtext\ncGacGbc(see the Mathematical\nAppendix). Maximum likelihood density estimation requires determiningthe\nGthat makes G\u00b7GT+/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1match, as closely as possible, the covariance\nmatrix of the input distribution.\nPrincipal Components Analysis\nIn the same way that setting the parameters /Sigma1vto zero in the mixture of\nGaussians model leads to the K-means algorithm, setting all the variances\nin factor analysis to zero leads to another well-known method, principalcomponents analysis (which is also discussed in chapter 8). To see this,consider the case of a single factor. This means that\nvis a single number,\nand that the mean of the distribution p[u|v;G]i svg, where the vector g\nreplaces the matrix Gof the general case. The elements of the diagonal\nmatrix /Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1are set to a single variance /Sigma1, which we shrink to zero.\nAs/Sigma1\u21920, the Gaussian distribution p[u|v;G] in equation 10.18 ap-\nproaches a \u03b4function (see the Mathematical Appendix), and it can only\ngenerate the single vector u(v)=vgfrom cause v. Similarly, the recogni-\ntion distribution of equation 10.20 becomes a \u03b4function, making the recog-\nnition process deterministic with v(u)=W\u00b7ugiven by the mean of the\nrecognition distribution of equation 10.20. Using the expression for Win\nthe appendix in the limit /Sigma1\u21920, we \ufb01nd\nv(u)=g\u00b7u\n|g|2. (10.22)\nThis is the result of the E phase of EM. In the M phase, we maximize\nF(v(u),G)=/angbracketleftbig\nlnp[v(u),u;G]/angbracketrightbig=K\u2212Nuln/Sigma1\n2\u2212/angbracketleftbiggv2(u)\n2+|u\u2212gv(u)|2\n2/Sigma1/angbracketrightbigg\n(10.23)\nwith respect to g, without changing the expression for v(u). Here, Kis\na term independent of gand/Sigma1. In this expression, the only term that\ndepends on gis proportional to |u\u2212gv(u)|2. Minimizing this in the M\nphase produces a new value of ggiven by\ng=/angbracketleftv(u)u/angbracketright\n/angbracketleftv2(u)/angbracketright. (10.24)\nThis only depends on the covariance matrix of the input distribution, as\ndoes the more general form given in the appendix. Under EM, equa-tions 10.22 and 10.24 are alternated until convergence.\nFor principal components analysis, we can say more about the value of\ngat convergence. We consider the case\n|g|2=1 because we can always\nmultiply gand divide v(u)by the same factor to make this true without\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n16 Representational Learning\naffecting the dominant term in F(v(u),G)as/Sigma1\u21920. Then, the gthat\nmaximizes this dominant term must minimize\n/angbracketleftbig|u\u2212g(g\u00b7u)|2/angbracketrightbig=/angbracketleftbig|u|2\u2212(g\u00b7u)2/angbracketrightbig. (10.25)\nHere, we have used expression 10.22 for v(u). Minimizing 10.25 with re-\nspect to g, subject to the constraint |g|2=1, gives the result that gis the\neigenvector of the covariance matrix /angbracketleftuu/angbracketrightwith maximum eigenvalue. This\nis just the principal component vector and is equivalent to \ufb01nding the vec-\ntor of unit length with the largest possible average projection onto u.\nThe argument we have given shows that principal components analysis is\na degenerate form of factor analysis. This is also true if more than one fac-tor is considered, although maximizing\nFonly constrains the projections\nG\u00b7uand therefore only forces Gto represent the principal components\nsubspace of the data. The same subspace emerges from full factor analysisprovided that the variances of all the factors are equal, even when they arenonzero.\nFigure 10.3 illustrates an important difference between factor analysis and\nprincipal components analysis. In this \ufb01gure, uis a three-component input\nvector, u\n=(u1,u2,u3). Samples of input data were generated on the basis\nof a \u2018true\u2019 cause, vtrueaccording to\nub=vtrue+/epsilon1b (10.26)\nwhere /epsilon1brepresents noise on component bof the input. Input data points\nwere generated from this equation by chosing a value of vtruefrom a Gaus-\nsian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, and values of /epsilon1bfrom inde-\npendent Gaussian distributions with zero means. The variances of thedistributions for\n/epsilon1b,b=1,2,3, were all are equal to 0 .25 in \ufb01gures 10.3A &\nB. However, in \ufb01gures 10.3C & D, the variance for /epsilon13is much larger (equal\nto 9). We can think of this as representing the effect of a noisy sensor forthis component of the input vector. The graphs plot the mean of the valueof the cause\nvextraced from sample inputs by factor analysis, or the ac-\ntual value of vfor principal components analysis, as a function of the true\nvalue vtrueused to generate the data. Perfect extraction of the underlying\ncause would \ufb01ndv=vtrue. Here, perfect extraction is impossible because\nof the noise, and the absolute scale of vis arbitrary. Thus, the best we can\nexpect is vvalues that are scattered but lie along a straight line when plot-\nted as a function of vtrue. When the input components are equally variable\n(\ufb01gure 10.3A& B), this is exactly what happens for both factor and princi-\npal components analysis. However, when u3is much more variable than\nthe other components, principal components analysis ( \ufb01gure 10.3D) is se-\nduced by the extra variance and \ufb01nds a cause vthat does not correspond\ntovtrue. By contrast, factor analysis ( \ufb01gure 10.3C) is only affected by the co-\nvariance between the input components and not by their individual vari-ances (which are absorbed into\n/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1), so the cause it \ufb01nds is not signi \ufb01cantly\nperturbed (merely somewhat degraded) by the added sensor noise.\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The plots compare the true cause vtruewith\nthe cause vinferred by the model.\nIn chapter 8, we noted that principal components analysis maximizes the\nmutual information between the input and output under the assumptionof a linear Gaussian model. This property, and the fact that principalcomponents analysis minimizes the reconstruction error of equation 10.25,have themselves been suggested as goals for representational learning. Wehave now shown how they are also related to density estimation.\nBoth principal components analysis and factor analysis produce a marginal\ndistribution p[u\n;G] that is Gaussian. If the actual input distribution p[u]\nis non-Gaussian, the best that these models can do is to match the meanand covariance of p[u]; they will fail to match higher-order moments. If\nthe input is whitened to increase coding ef \ufb01ciency, as discussed in chap-\nter 4, so that the covariance matrix\n/angbracketleftuu/angbracketrightis equal the identity matrix, neither\nmethod will extract any structure at all from the input data. By contrast,the generative models discussed in the following sections produce non-Gaussian marginal distributions and attempt to account for structure inthe input data beyond merely the mean and covariance.\nSparse Coding\nThe prior distributions in factor analysis and principal components analy-sis are Gaussian and, if the model is sucessful, the distribution of\nvvalues\nin response to input should also be Gaussian.

Figure 10.4A shows an example of the distribu-tion of the numbers of spikes counted within a particular time window fora neuron in the infero-temporal (IT) area of the macaque brain recordedwhile a monkey freely viewed television shows. The distribution is closeto being exponential. This means that the neurons are most likely to \ufb01re\nsmall numbers of spikes in the counting interval, but that they can occa-sionally \ufb01re a large number of spikes. Neurons in primary visual cortex\nexhibit similar patterns of activity in response to natural scenes.\nDistributions that generate values for the components of vclose to zero\nmost of the time, but occassionally far from zero, are called sparse. Sparse sparse distributions\ndistributions are de \ufb01ned as being more likely than Gaussians of the same\nmean and variance to generate values near zero and also more likely togenerate values far from zero. These occasional high values can conveysubstantial information. Distributions with this character are also calledheavy-tailed. Figures 10.4B and C compare two sparse distributions to aGaussian distribution.\nSparseness has been de \ufb01ned in a variety of different ways.

This is a slightly different de \ufb01nition of sparse-\nness from being heavy-tailed.\nA sparse representation over a large population of neurons might more\nnaturally be de \ufb01ned as one in which each input is encoded by a small\nnumber of the neurons in the population. Unfortunately, identifying thisform of sparseness experimentally is dif \ufb01cult.\nUnlike factor analysis and principal components analysis, sparse coding\ndoes not stress minimizing the number of representing units (i.e. compo-nents of v). Indeed, sparse representations may require large numbers of\nunits (though not necessarily). This is not a disadvantage when these mod-els are applied to the visual system because representations in visual areasare greatly expanded at various steps along the pathway. For example,there are around 40 cells in primary visual cortex for each cell in the visualthalamus. Downstream processing can bene \ufb01t greatly from sparse rep-\nresentations, because, for one thing, they minimize interference betweendifferent patterns of input.\nFactor analysis and principal components analysis do not generate sparse\nrepresentations because they have Gaussian priors. The mixture of Gaus-sians model is extremely sparse because each input is represented by asingle cause (although the same cause could be deemed responsible forevery input). This may be reasonable for relatively simple input patterns,but for complex stimuli such as images, we seek something between theseextremes. Olshausen and Field (1996, 1997) suggested such a model byconsidering a nonlinear version of factor analysis. In this model, the dis-tribution of ugiven vis a Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix, as\nfor factor analysis, but the prior distribution over causes is sparse. De \ufb01ned\nin terms of a function g\n(v)(as in \ufb01gure 10.4),\np[v;G]\u221dNv/productdisplay\na=1exp(g(va))and p[u|v;G]=N(u;G\u00b7v,/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1). (10.28)\nThe prior p[v;G] should be normalized so that its integral over vis one,\nbut we omit the normalization factor to simplify the equations.\nBecause it is a product, the prior p[v;G] in equation 10.28 makes the com-\nponents of vmutually independent. If we took g(v)=\u2212v2,p[v;G] would\nbe Gaussian (dotted lines in \ufb01gures 10.4B & C), and the model would per-\nform factor analysis. An example of a function that provides a sparseprior is g\n(v)=\u2212\u03b1|v|. This generates a double exponential distribution\n(solid lines in \ufb01gures 10.4B & C) similar to the activity distribution in \ufb01g- double exponential\ndistribution ure 10.4A. Another commonly used form is\ng(v)=\u2212 ln(\u03b22+v2) (10.29)\nwith\u03b2a constant, which generates a Cauchy distribution (dashed lines in Cauchy\ndistribution \ufb01gures 10.4B & C).\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n20 Representational Learning\nFor g(v)such as equation 10.29, it is dif \ufb01cult to compute the recogni-\ntion distribution p[v|u;G] exactly. This makes the sparse model non-\ninvertible. Olshausen and Field chose a deterministic approximate recog-nition model. Thus, EM consists of \ufb01nding v\n(u)during the E phase, and\nusing it to adjust the parameters Gduring the M phase. To simplify the\ndiscussion, we make the covariance matrix proportional to the identitymatrix,\n/Sigma1/Sigma1/Sigma1=/Sigma1I. The function to be maximized is then\nF(v(u),G)=/angbracketleftBigg\n\u22121\n2/Sigma1|u\u2212G\u00b7v(u)|2+Nv/summationdisplay\na=1g(va(u))/angbracketrightBigg\n+K (10.30)\nwhere Kis a term that is independent of Gand v. For convenience in\ndiscussing the EM procedure, we further take /Sigma1=1 and do not allow it to\nvary. Similarly, we assume that \u03b2in equation 10.29 is predetermined and\nheld\ufb01xed. Then, Gconsists only of the matrix G.\nThe E phase of EM involves maximizing Fwith respect to v(u)for every\nu. This leads to the conditions (for all a)\nNu/summationdisplay\nb=1[u\u2212G\u00b7v(u)]bGba+g/prime(va)=0. (10.31)\nT h ep r i m eo n g(va)indicates a derivative.

This equation changes vso that\nit asymptotically approaches a value v=v(u)that satis \ufb01es equation 10.31\nand makes the right side of equation 10.32 zero. We assume that the evo-lution of vaccording to equation 10.32 is carried out long enough during\nthe E phase for this to happen. This process is only guaranteed to \ufb01nd a\nlocal, not a global, maximum of\nF, and it is not guaranteed to \ufb01nd the\nsame local maximum on each iteration.\nEquation 10.32 resembles the equation used in chapter 7 for a \ufb01ring-rate\nnetwork model. The term/summationtext\nbubGba,w h i c hc a nb ew r i t t e ni nv e c t o rf o r m\nasGT\u00b7u, acts as the total input arising from units with activities ufed\nthrough a feedforward coupling matrix GT.

Finally, the term g/prime(va)plays the same role as the term \u2212vathat\nwould appear in the rate equations of chapter 7. If g/prime(v)/negationslash=\u2212v, this can be\ninterpreted as a modi \ufb01ed form of \ufb01ring-rate dynamics. Figure 10.5 shows\nthe resulting network.

A complica-\ntion arises here because the matrix Galways appears multiplied by v. This\nmeans that the bias toward small values of vaimposed by the prior can be\neffectively neutralized by scaling up G. This complication results from the\napproximation of deterministic recognition. To prevent the weights fromgrowing without bound, constraints are applied on the lengths of the gen-erative weights for each cause,/summationtext\nbG2\nba, to encourage the variances of all\nthe different vato be approximately equal (see the appendix). Further, it\nis conventional to pre-condition the inputs before learning by whiteningthem so that\n/angbracketleftu/angbracketright=0 and /angbracketleftuu/angbracketright=I. This typically makes learning faster,\nand it also ensures that the network is forced to \ufb01nd statistical structure\nbeyond second order that would escape simpler methods such as factoranalysis or principal components analysis. In the case that the input is cre-ated by sampling (e.g. pixelating an image), more sophisticated forms ofpre-conditioning can be used to remove the resulting artifacts.\nApplying the sparse coding model to inputs coming from the pixel intensi-\nties of small square patches of monochrome photographs of natural scenesleads to selectivities that resemble those of cortical simple cells. Beforestudying this result, we need to specify how the selectivities of generativemodels, such as the sparse coding model, are de \ufb01ned. The selectivities of\nsensory neurons are typically described by receptive \ufb01elds, as in chapter\n2. For a causal model, one de \ufb01nition of a receptive \ufb01eld for unit ais the set\nof inputs ufor which\nvais likely to take large values. However, it may be\nimpossible to construct receptive \ufb01eld by averaging over these inputs in\nnonlinear models, such as sparse coding models. Furthermore, generativemodels are most naturally characterized by projective \ufb01elds rather than projective \ufb01eld\nreceptive \ufb01elds.

It is important to remember that projective \ufb01elds\ncan be quite different from receptive \ufb01elds.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n22 Representational Learning\nA\nB\nprojective\nfieldreceptive\nfield - dotsreceptive\nfield - gratings\nFigure 10.6: Projective and receptive \ufb01elds for a sparse coding network with\nNu=Nv=144.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.3 Causal Models for Density Estimation 23\nProjective \ufb01elds for the Olshausen and Field model trained on natural\nscenes are shown in \ufb01gure 10.6A, with one picture for each component\nofv. In this case, the projective \ufb01eld for vais simply the matrix elements\nGabplotted for all bvalues. In \ufb01gure 10.6A, the index bis plotted over\na two-dimensional grid representing the location of the input ubwithin\nthe visual \ufb01eld. The projective \ufb01elds form a Gabor-like representation for\nimages, covering a variety of spatial scales and orientations. The resem-blance of this representation to the receptive \ufb01elds of simple cells in pri-\nmary visual cortex is quite striking, although these are the projective notthe receptive \ufb01elds of the model. Unfortunately, there is no simple form\nfor the receptive \ufb01elds of the vunits. Figure 10.6B compares the projective\n\ufb01eld of one unit to receptive \ufb01elds determined by presenting either dots\nor gratings as inputs and recording the responses. The responses to thedots directly determine the receptive \ufb01eld, while responses to the gratings\ndirectly determine the Fourier transform of the receptive \ufb01eld. Differences\nbetween the receptive \ufb01elds calculated on the basis of these two types of\ninput are evident in the \ufb01gure. In particular, the receptive \ufb01eld computed\nfrom gratings shows more spatial structure than the one mapped by dots.Nevertheless, both show a resemblance to the projective \ufb01eld and to a typ-\nical simple-cell receptive \ufb01eld.\nIn a generative model, projective \ufb01elds are associated with the causes\nunderlying the visual images presented during training. The fact thatthe causes extracted by the sparse coding model resemble Gabor patcheswithin the visual \ufb01eld is somewhat strange from this perspective. It is dif \ufb01-\ncult to conceive of images as arising from such low level causes, instead ofcauses couched in terms of objects within the images, for example. Fromthe perspective of good representation, causes that are more like objectsand less like Gabor patches would be more useful. To put this another way,although the prior distribution over causes biased them toward mutual in-dependence, the causes produced by the recognition model in response tonatural images are not actually independent. This is due to the structurein images arising from more complex objects than bars and gratings. It isunlikely that this high-order structure can be extracted by a model withonly one set of causes. It is more natural to think of causes in a hierarchi-cal manner, with causes at a higher level accounting for structure in thecauses at a lower level. The multiple representations in areas along the vi-sual pathway suggests such a hierarchical scheme, but the correspondingmodels are still in the rudimentary stages of development.\nIndependent Components Analysis\nAs for the case of the mixtures of Gaussians model and factor analysis, an\ninteresting model emerges from sparse coding as\n/Sigma1\u21920.

Under the conventional EM procedure, we\nwould maximize this expression with respect to G, keeping W\ufb01xed. How-\never, the normal procedure fails in this case, because the minimum of theright side of equation 10.34 occurs at G\n=W\u22121, and Wis being held \ufb01xed\nsoGcannot change. This is an anomaly of coordinate ascent in this partic-\nular limit.\nFortunately, it is easy to \ufb01x this problem, because we know that W=G\u22121\nprovides an exact inversion of the generative model. Therefore, instead of\nholding W\ufb01xed during the M phase of an EM procedure, we keep W=\nG\u22121at all times as we change G. This sets Fequal to the average log\nlikelihood, and the process of optimizing with respect to Gis equivalent\nto likelihood maximization. Because W=G\u22121, maximizing with respect\ntoWis equivalent to maximizing with respect to G, and it turns out that\nthis is easier to do. Therefore, we set W=G\u22121in equation 10.34, which\ncauses the \ufb01rst term to vanish, and write the remaining terms as the log\nlikelihood expressed as a function of Winstead of G,\nL(W)=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nag([W\u00b7u]a)/angbracketrightBigg\n+ln|detW|+K.

(10.38)\nThis algorithm is called independent components analysis. Just as the\nsparse coding network is a nonlinear generalization of factor analysis, in-dependent components analysis is a nonlinear generalization of principalcomponents analysis that attempts to account for non-Gaussian features ofthe input distribution. The generative model is based on the assumptionthat u\n=G\u00b7v. Some other technical conditions must be satis \ufb01ed for in-\ndependent components analysis to extract reasonable causes, speci \ufb01cally\nthe prior distributions over causes p[v]\u221dexp(g(v)) must be non-Gaussian\nand, at least to the extent of being correctly super- or sub-Gaussian, mustfaithfully re \ufb02ect the actual distribution over causes. The particular form\np[\nv]\u221d1/cosh(v)is super-Gaussian, and thus generates a sparse prior.\nThere are variants of independent components analysis in which the priordistributions are adaptive.\nThe independent components algorithm was suggested by Bell and Se-\njnowski (1995) from the different perspective of maximizing the mutualinformation between uand vwhen\nva(u)=f([W\u00b7u]a), with a particular,\nmonotonically increasing nonlinear function f. Maximizing the mutual\ninformation in this context requires maximizing the entropy of the distri-bution over v. This, in turn, requires the components of vto be as indepen-\ndent as possible because redundancy between them reduces the entropy.In the case that f\n(v)=g/prime(v), the expression for the entropy is the same as\nthat for the log likelihood L(W)in equation 10.35, up to constant factors,\nso maximizing the entropy and performing maximum likelihood densityestimation are identical.\nAn advantage of independent components analysis over other sparse cod-\ning algorithms is that, because the recognition model is an exact inverseof the generative model, receptive as well as projective \ufb01elds can be con-\nstructed. Just as the projective \ufb01eld for\nvacan be represented by the matrix\nelements Gabfor all bvalues, the receptive \ufb01eld is given by Wabfor all b.\nTo illustrate independent components analysis, \ufb01gure 10.7 shows an (ad-\nmittedly bizarre) example of its application to the sounds created by tap-ping a tooth while adjusting the shape of the mouth to reproduce a tuneby Beethoven. The input, sampled at 8 kHz, has the spectrogram shownin\ufb01gure 10.7A. In this example, we have some idea about likely causes.\nFor example, the plots in \ufb01gures 10.7B & C show high- and low-frequency\ntooth taps, although other causes arise from the imperfect recording con-ditions.

The parameters are determined by a modi \ufb01ed EM algorithm\nthat results in roughly symmetric updates for the two networks.\nWe consider a simple, two-layer, nonlinear Helmholtz machine with bi-\nnary units, so that ubandvafor all band atake the values 0 or 1.

The generative model is thus\nparameterized by G=(g,h,G). According to these distributions, the\ncomponents of vare mutually independent, and the components of uare\nindependent given a \ufb01xed value of v.\nThe generative model is non-invertible in this case, so an approximate\nrecognition distribution must be constructed.

This distri-\nbution is only an approximate inverse of the generative model because itimplies that the components of vare independent when, in fact, given a\nparticular input u, they are conditionally dependent, due to the way they\ncan interact in equation 10.40 to generate u.\nThe EM algorithm for this non-invertible model would consist of alter-\nnately maximizing the function\nFgiven by\nF(W,G)=/angbracketleftBigg/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u,W]l nP[v,u;G]\nQ[v;u,W]/angbracketrightBigg\n(10.42)\nwith respect to the parameters Wand G.

However, during the\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n28 Representational Learning\nE phase, maximizing with respect to Wis problematic because the func-\ntion Q[v;u,W] appears in two places in the expression for F. This also\nmakes the learning rule during the E phase take a different form from thatof the M phase rule. Instead, the Helmholtz machine uses a simpler andmore symmetric approximation to EM.\nThe approximation to EM used by the Helmholtz machine is constructed\nby re-expressing\nFfrom equation 10.9, explicitly writing out the average\nover input data and then the expression for the Kullback-Leibler diver-gence,\nF(W,G)=L(G)\u2212/summationdisplay\nuP[u]DKL(Q[v;u,W],P[v|u;G]) (10.43)\n=L(G)\u2212/summationdisplay\nuP[u]/summationdisplay\nvQ[v;u,W]l n/parenleftbiggQ[v;u,W]\nP[v|u;G]/parenrightbigg\n.\nThis is the function that is maximized with respect to Gduring the M\nphase for the Helmholtz machine. However, the E phase is not based onmaximizing equation 10.43 with respect to\nW. Instead, an approximate F\nfunction that we call \u02dcFis used. This is constructed by using P[u;G]a s\nan approximation for P[u] and DKL(P[v|u;G],Q[v;u,W])as an approxi-\nmation for DKL(Q[v;u,W],P[v|u;G])in equation 10.43. These are likely\nto be good approximations if the generative and approximate recognitionmodels are accurate. Thus, we write\n\u02dcF(W,G)=L(G)\u2212/summationdisplay\nuP[u;G]DKL(P[v|u;G],Q[v;u,W])(10.44)\n=L(G)\u2212/summationdisplay\nuP[u;G]/summationdisplay\nvP[v|u;G]l n/parenleftbiggP[v|u;G]\nQ[v;u,W]/parenrightbigg\n.\nand maximize this, rather than F, with respect to Wduring the E phase.\nThis amounts to averaging the \u2018 \ufb02ipped\u2019 Kullback-Leibler divergence over\nsamples of ucreated by the generative model, rather than real data sam-\nples. The advantage of making these approximations is that the E and Mphases become highly symmetric, as can be seen by examining the secondequalities in equations 10.43 and 10.44.\nLearning in the Helmholtz machine proceeds using stochastic sampling to\nreplace the weighted sums in equations 10.43 and 10.44. In the M phase,an input ufrom P[u] is presented, and a sample vis drawn from the cur-\nrent recognition distribution Q[v\n;u,W]. Then, the generative weights G\nare changed according to the discrepancy between uand the generative or\ntop-down prediction f(h+G\u00b7v)ofu(see the appendix). Thus, the gener-\native model is trained to make umore likely to be generated by the cause\nvassociated with it by the recognition model. In the E phase, samples of\nboth vand uare drawn from the generative model distributions P[v;G]\nand P[u|v;G], and the recognition parameters Ware changed according\nto the discrepancy between the sampled cause v, and the recognition or\nbottom-up prediction f(w+W\u00b7u)ofv(see the appendix). The rationale\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n10.4 Discussion 29\nfor this is that the vthat was used by the generative model to create uis a\ngood choice for its cause in the recognition model.\nThe two phases of learning are sometimes called wake and sleep because wake-sleep\nalgorithm learning in the \ufb01rst phase is driven by real inputs ufrom the environment,\nwhile learning in the second phase is driven by values vand u\u2018fantasized\u2019\nby the generative model. This terminology is based on slightly differentprinciples from the wake and sleep phases of the Boltzmann machine dis-cussed in chapter 8. The sleep phase is only an approximation of the actualE phase, and general conditions under which learning converges appro-priately are not known.\n10.4 Discussion\nBecause of the widespread signi \ufb01cance of coding, transmitting, storing,\nand decoding visual images such as photographs and movies, substan-tial effort has been devoted to understanding the structure of this classof inputs. As a result, visual images provide an ideal testing ground forrepresentational learning algorithms, allowing us to go beyond evaluatingthe representations they produce solely in terms of the log likelihood andqualitative similarities with cortical receptive \ufb01elds.\nMost modern image (and auditory) processing techniques are based on\nmulti-resolution decompositions. In such decompositions, images are rep-resented by the activity of a population of units with systematically vary-ing spatial frequency preferences and different orientations, centered atvarious locations on the image. The outputs of the representational unitsare generated by \ufb01lters (typically linear) that act as receptive \ufb01elds and are\npartially localized in both space and spatial frequency. The \ufb01lters usually\nhave similar underlying forms, but they are cast at different spatial scalesand centered at different locations for the different units. Systematic ver-sions of such representations, in forms such as wavelets, are importantsignal processing tools, and there is an extensive body of theory abouttheir representational and coding qualities. Representation of sensory in-formation in separated frequency bands at different spatial locations hassigni\ufb01cant psychophysical consequences as well.\nThe projective \ufb01elds of the units in the sparse coding network shown in\n\ufb01gure 10.6 suggest that they construct something like a multi-resolution\ndecomposition of inputs, with multiple spatial scales, locations, and orien-tations. Thus, multi-resolution analysis gives us a way to put into sharperfocus the issues arising from models such as sparse coding and indepen-dent components analysis. After a brief review of multi-resolution de-compositions, we use them to consider d properties of representationallearning from the perspective of information transmission and sparseness,overcompleteness, and residual dependencies between inferred causes.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n30 Representational Learning\nFT spaceAB\nactivitylog frequency\nFigure 10.9: Multi-resolution \ufb01ltering.

The pixel values of the\nimage were rescaled to \ufb01t into the range. (Adapted from Simoncelli and Freeman,\n1995; Karasaridis and Simoncelli, 1996 & 1997.)\nMulti-resolution decomposition\nMany multi-resolution decompositions, with a variety of computational\nand representational properties, can be expressed as linear transforma-tions v\n=W\u00b7uwhere the rows of Wdescribe \ufb01lters, such as those illus-\ntrated in \ufb01gure 10.9A. Figure 10.10 shows the result of applying multi-\nresolution \ufb01lters, constructed by scaling and shifting the \ufb01lters shown in\n\ufb01gure 10.9A, to the photograph in \ufb01gure 10.10A. Vertical and horizontal\n\ufb01lters similar to those in \ufb01gure 10.9A, but with different sizes, produce\nthe decomposition shown in \ufb01gures 10.10B-D and F-H when translated\nacross the image. The greyscale indicates the output generated by plac-ing the different \ufb01lters over the corresponding points on the image. These\noutputs, plus the low-pass image in \ufb01gure 10.10E and an extra high-pass\nimage that is not shown, can be used to reconstruct the whole photographalmost perfectly through a generative process that is the inverse of therecognition process.\nCoding\nOne reason for using multi-resolution decompositions is that they offer\nef\ufb01cient ways of encoding visual images. The raw values of input pix-\nels provide an inef \ufb01cient encoding of images. This is illustrated by the\ndot-dashed line in \ufb01gure 10.9B, which shows that the distribution over the\nvalues of the input pixels of the image in \ufb01gure 10.10A is approximately\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

Up to the usual additive constants related to the precision\nwith which \ufb01lter outputs are encoded, the contribution to the coding cost\nfrom a single unit is the entropy of the probability distribution of its out-put. The distribution over pixel intensities is \ufb02at, which is the maximum\nentropy distribution for a variable with a \ufb01xed range. Encoding the indi-\nvidual pixel values therefore incurs the maximum possible coding cost.\nBy contrast, the solid line in \ufb01gure 10.9B shows the distribution of the\noutputs of the \ufb01nest scale vertically and horizontally tuned \ufb01lters ( \ufb01g-\nures 10.10D & H) in response to \ufb01gure 10.10A. The \ufb01lter outputs have a\nsparse distribution similar to the double exponential distribution in \ufb01g-\nure 10.4B. This distribution has signi \ufb01cantly lower entropy than the uni-\nform distribution, so the \ufb01lter outputs provide a more ef \ufb01cient encoding\nthan pixel values.\nIn making these statements about the distributions of activities, we are\nequating the output distribution of a \ufb01lter applied at many locations on\na single image with the output distribution of a \ufb01lter applied at a \ufb01xed\nlocation on many images. This assumes spatial translational invariance ofthe ensemble of visual images.\nImages represented by multi-resolution \ufb01lters can be further compressed\nby retaining only approximate values of the \ufb01lter outputs. This is called\nlossy coding and may consist of reporting \ufb01lter outputs as integer multi- lossy coding\nples of a basic unit. Making the multi-resolution code for an image lossyby coarsely quantizing the outputs of the highest spatial frequency \ufb01lters\ngenerally has quite minimal perceptual consequences while saving sub-\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n32 Representational Learning\nstantial coding cost (because these outputs are most numerous). This fact\nillustrates the important point that trying to build generative models ofall aspects of visual images may be unnecessarily dif \ufb01cult, because only\ncertain aspects of images are actually relevant. Unfortunately, abstractprinciples are unlikely to tell us what information in the input can safelybe discarded independent of details of how the representations are to beused.\nOvercomplete Representations\nSparse representations often have more output units than input units.\nSuch representations, called overcomplete, are the subject of substantialwork in multi-resolution theory. Many reasons have been suggested forovercompleteness, although none obviously emerges from the require-ment of \ufb01tting good probabilistic models to input data.\nOne interesting idea comes from the notion that the task of manipulat-\ning representations should be invariant to the groups of symmetry trans-formations of the input, which, for images, include rotation, translation,and scaling. Complete representations are minimal, and so do not denselysample orientations. This means that the operations required to manipu-late images of objects presented at angles not directly represented by the\ufb01lters are different from those required at the represented angles (such as\nhorizontal and vertical for the example of \ufb01gure 10.9). When a represen-\ntation is overcomplete in such a way that different orientations are rep-resented roughly equally, as in primary visual cortex, the computationaloperations required to manipulate images are more uniform as a functionof image orientation. Similar ideas apply across scale, so that the opera-tions required to manipulate large and small images of the same object (asif viewed from near or far) are likewise similar. It is impossible to generaterepresentations that satisfy all these constraints perfectly.\nIn more realistic models that include noise, other rationales for overcom-\npleteness come from considering population codes, in which many unitsredundantly report information about closely related quantities so that un-certainty can be reduced. Despite the ubiquity of overcomplete populationcodes in the brain, there are few representational learning models that pro-duce them satisfactorarily. The coordinated representations required toconstruct population codes are often incompatible with other heuristicssuch as factorial or sparse coding.\nInterdependent Causes\nOne of the failings of multi-resolution decompositions for coding is that\nthe outputs are not mutually independent. This makes encoding each ofthe redundant \ufb01lter outputs wasteful. Figure 10.11 illustrates such an in-\nterdependence by showing the conditional distribution for the output\nvcof\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

The plots show gray-scale valuesof the conditional probability density p[\nvc|vp]. The mean of this distribu-\ntion is roughly 0, but there is a clear correlation between the magnitude of\n|vp|and the variance of vc. This means that structure in the image is coor-\ndinated across different spatial scales, so that high outputs from a coarsescale \ufb01lter are typically accompanied by substantial output (of one sign or\nthe other) at a \ufb01ner scale. Following Simoncelli (1997), we plot the condi-\ntional distribution of ln\n|vc|given ln |vp|in\ufb01gure 10.11B. For small values\nof ln|vp|, the distribution of ln |vc|is\ufb02at, but for larger values of ln |vp|the\ngrowth in the value of |vc|is clear.\nThe interdependence shown in \ufb01gure 10.11 suggests a failing of sparse\ncoding to which we have alluded before. Although the prior distributionfor sparse coding stipulates independent causes, the causes identi \ufb01ed as\nunderlying real images are not independent. The dependence apparent in\ufb01gure 10.11 can be removed by a nonlinear transformation in which the\noutputs of the units normalize each other (similar to the model introducedto explain contrast saturation in chapter 2). This transformation can lead tomore compact codes for images. However, the general problem suggeststhat something is amiss with the heuristic of seeking independent causesfor representations early in the visual pathway.\nThe most important dependencies as far as casual models are concerned\nare those induced by the presence in images of objects with large-scale co-ordinated structure. Finding and building models of these dependenciesis the goal for more sophisticated and hierarchical representational learn-ing schemes aimed ultimately at object recognition within complex visualscenes.\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n34 Representational Learning\n10.5 Chapter Summary\nWe have presented a systematic treatment of exact and approximate max-\nimum likelihood density estimation as a way of \ufb01tting probabilistic gener-\native models and thereby performing representational learning.

Recent reviews, from which we have borrowed, include Hin-\nton (1989) ;Bishop (1995) ;Hinton & Ghahramani (1997) ; and Becker &\nPlumbley (1996) , which also describes unsupervised learning methods\nsuch as IMAX (Becker & Hinton (1992)) that \ufb01nd statistical structure in\nthe inputs directly rather than through causal models (see also projectionpursuit, Huber, 1985). The \ufb01eld of belief networks or graphical statistical\nmodels ( Pearl (1988) ; Lauritzen (1996); Jordan (1998) ) provides an even\nmore general framework for probabilistic generative models. Apart fromBarlow (1961; 1989 ), early inspiration for unsupervised learning models\ncame from Uttley (1979) and Marr (1970) and the adaptive resonance the-ory (ART) of Carpenter & Grossberg (see 1991).\nAnalysis by synthesis (e.g. Neisser, 1967), to which generative and recog-\nnition models are closely related, was developed in a statistical contextby Grenander (1995), and was suggested by Mumford (1994) as a wayof understanding hierarchical neural processing. Suggestions by MacKay(1956); Pece (1992); Kawato, et al., (1993); Rao & Ballard (1997) can be seenin a similar light.\nNowlan (1991) introduced the mixtures of Gaussians architecture into neu-\nral networks. Mixture models are commonplace in statistics and are de-scribed by Titterington et al. (1985).\nFactor analysis is described by Everitt (1984), and some of the differences\nand similarities between factor analysis and principal components analy-sis are brought out by Jolliffe (1986); Tipping & Bishop (1999); Roweis &Ghahramani (1999). Rubin & Thayer (1982) discuss the use of EM for factoranalysis.

(13)\nTypically, but not always, this has Nsolutions if Wis an NbyNmatrix,\nand these can be either real or complex. Complex eigenvalues come incomplex-conjugate pairs if Whas real-valued elements. We use the index\n\u00b5to label the different eigenvalues and eigenvectors, \u03bb\u00b5and e\u00b5. Note that\n\u00b5identi \ufb01es the eigenvector (and eigenvalue) to which we are referring; it\ndoes not signify a component of the eigenvector e\u00b5.\nIfeis an eigenvector, \u03b1eis also an eigenvector for any nonzero value of\n\u03b1. We can use this freedom to normalize eigenvectors so that |e|=1. If\ntwo eigenvectors, say e1and e2, have the same eigenvalues \u03bb1=\u03bb2, they\nare termed degenerate, Then, \u03b1e1+\u03b2e2is also an eigenvector with the degeneracy\nsame eigenvalue, for any \u03b1and\u03b2that are not both zero. Apart from such\ndegeneracies, an NbyNmatrix can have at most Neigenvectors, although\nsome matrices have fewer.

Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n5\nsider this case. The eigenvalues of a symmetric matrix are real, and the\neigenvectors are real and orthogonal (or can be made orthogonal in thecase of degeneracy). This means that, if they are normalized to unit length,the eigenvectors satisfy orthonormal\neigenvectors\ne\n\u00b5\u00b7e\u03bd=\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd. (15)\nThis can be derived by noting that, for a symmetric matrix W,e\u00b5\u00b7W=W\u00b7\ne\u00b5=\u03bb\u00b5e\u00b5. Therefore, allowing the matrix to act in both directions we \ufb01nd\ne\u03bd\u00b7W\u00b7e\u00b5=\u03bb\u00b5e\u03bd\u00b7e\u00b5=\u03bb\u03bde\u03bd\u00b7e\u00b5.I f\u03bb\u00b5/negationslash=\u03bb\u03bd, this requires e\u03bd\u00b7e\u00b5=0. For\northogonal and normalized (orthonormal) eigenvectors, the coef \ufb01cients in\nequation 14 take the values\nc\u00b5=v\u00b7e\u00b5. (16)\nLetE=(e1e2...eN)be an NbyNmatrix with columns formed from the\northonormal eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix. From equation 15, thissatis\ufb01es [E\nT\u00b7E]\u00b5\u03bd=e\u00b5\u00b7e\u03bd=\u03b4\u00b5\u03bd. Thus, ET=E\u22121, making Ean orthogo-\nnal matrix.

(17)\nConversely,\nW=E\u00b7diag(\u03bb1,...,\u03bb N)\u00b7E\u22121. (18)\nThe transformation to and back from a diagonal form is extremely use-\nful because computations with diagonal matrices are easy. De \ufb01ning L=\ndiag(\u03bb1,...,\u03bb N)we\ufb01nd, for example, that\nWn=(E\u00b7L\u00b7E\u22121)\u00b7(E\u00b7L\u00b7E\u22121)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(E\u00b7L\u00b7E\u22121)\n=E\u00b7Ln\u00b7E\u22121=E\u00b7diag(\u03bbn\n1,...,\u03bbn\nN)\u00b7E\u22121. (19)\nIndeed, for any function fthat can be written as a power or expanded in\na power series (including, for example, exponentials and logarithms),\nf(W)=E\u00b7diag(f(\u03bb1),... , f(\u03bbN))\u00b7E\u22121.

The analog of a diagonal matrix is afunction of two variables that is proportional to a\n\u03b4function, W(t,t/prime)=\nh(t)\u03b4(t\u2212t/prime), for any function h.\nAll of the vector and matrix operations and properties de \ufb01ned above have\nfunctional analogs.

In this limit, the \u03b4function\napproaches zero everywhere except where its argument is zero, and thereit grows without bound.

In essence, any function that integrates to one and has a singlepeak that gets continually narrower and taller as the limit is taken can beused. For example, the\n\u03b4function can be expressed as the limit of a square\npulse\n\u03b4(t)=lim\n/Delta1t\u21920/braceleftbigg1//Delta1tif\u2212/Delta1t/2<t</Delta1 t/2\n0 otherwise(28)\nor a Gaussian function\n\u03b4(t)=lim\n/Delta1t\u219201\u221a\n2\u03c0/Delta1texp/bracketleftBigg\n\u22121\n2/parenleftbiggt\n/Delta1t/parenrightbigg2/bracketrightBigg\n.

(49)\nMany variants of this equation, solved by a number of techniques, appear\nin the text.\nOften, when a function f(v)has to be minimized or maximized with re-\nspect to a vector vthere is an additional constraint on vthat requires an-\nother function g(v)to be held constant. The standard way of dealing with\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n11\nthis situation is to \ufb01nd the extrema of the function f(v)+\u03bbg(v)where \u03bbis\na free parameter called a Lagrange multiplier. Once this is done, the value Lagrange\nmultiplier of\u03bbis determined by requiring g(v)to take the required constant value.\nThis procedure can appear a bit mysterious when \ufb01rst encountered, so we\nprovide a rather extended discussion.\nThe condition that characterizes an extreme value of the function f(v)is\nthat small changes /Delta1v(with components /Delta1v a)i nt h ev e c t o r vshould not\nchange the value of the function, to \ufb01rst order in /Delta1v. This results in the\ncondition\nN/summationdisplay\na=1fa/Delta1v a=0 (50)\nwhere we use the notation\nfa=[\u2207f]a=\u2202f\n\u2202va(51)\nto make the equations more compact. Without a constraint, equation 50\nmust be satis \ufb01ed for all /Delta1v, which can only occur if each term in the sum\nvanishes separately. Thus, we \ufb01nd the usual condition for an extremum\nfa=\u2202f\n\u2202va=0 (52)\nfor all a. However, with a constraint such as g(v)=constant, equation\n50 does not have to hold for all possible /Delta1v, only for those that satisfy the\nconstraint. The condition on /Delta1vimposed by the constraint is that it cannot\nchange the value of g,t o\ufb01rst order in /Delta1v. Therefore,\nN/summationdisplay\na=1ga/Delta1v a=0 (53)\nwith the same notation for the derivative used for gas for f.\nThe most obvious way to deal with the constraint equation 53 is to solve\nfor one of the components of /Delta1v,s a y/Delta1v c, writing\n/Delta1v c=\u22121\ngc/summationdisplay\na/negationslash=cga/Delta1v a. (54)\nThen, we substitute this expression into equation 50 to obtain\n/summationdisplay\na/negationslash=cfa/Delta1v a\u2212fc\ngc/summationdisplay\na/negationslash=cga/Delta1v a=0. (55)\nBecause we have eliminated the constraint, this equation must be satis \ufb01ed\nfor all values of the remaining components of /Delta1v, those with a/negationslash=c, and\nthus we \ufb01nd\nfa\u2212fc\ngcga=0 (56)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n12\nfor all a/negationslash=c. The derivatives of fand gare functions of v, so these equa-\ntions can be solved to determine where the extremum point is located.\nIn the above derivation, we have singled out component cfor special treat-\nment. We have no way of knowing until we get to the end of the calcula-tion whether the particular cwe chose leads to a simple or a complex set of\n\ufb01nal equations. The clever idea of the Lagrange multiplier is to notice that\nthe whole problem is symmetric with respect to the different componentsof\n/Delta1v. Choosing one cvalue, as we did above, breaks this symmetry and\noften complicates the algebra. To introduce the Lagrange multiplier wesimply de \ufb01ne it as\n\u03bb=\u2212fc\ngc. (57)\nWith this notation, the \ufb01nal set of equations can be written as\nfa+\u03bbga=0. (58)\nBefore we had to say that these equations only held for a/negationslash=cbecause cwas\ntreated differently. Now, however, notice that the above equation when a\nis set to cis algebraically equivalent to the de \ufb01nition of equation 57. Thus,\nwe can say that equation 58 applies for all a, and this provides a symmetric\nformulation of the problem of \ufb01nding an extremum that often results in\nsimpler algebra.\nThe\ufb01nal realization is that equation 58 for all ais precisely what we would\nhave derived if we had set out in the \ufb01rst place to \ufb01nd an extremum of the\nfunction f(v)+\u03bbg(v)and forgot about the constraint entirely. Of course\nthis lunch is not completely free. From equation 58, we derive a set ofextremum points parameterized by the undetermined variable\n\u03bb.T o\ufb01x\n\u03bb, we must substitute this family of solutions back into g(v)and\ufb01nd the\nvalue of \u03bbthat satis \ufb01es the constraint that g(v)equals the speci \ufb01ed con-\nstant. This provides the solution to the constrained problem.\nDifferential Equations\nThe most general differential equation we consider takes the form\ndv\ndt=f(v) (59)\nwhere v(t)is an N-component vector of time-dependent variables, and\nfis a vector of functions of v. Unless it is unstable, allowing the abso-\nlute value of one or more of the components of vto grow without bound,\nthis type of equation has three classes of solutions. For one class, called\ufb01xed points, v\n(t)approaches a time-independent vector v\u221e(v(t)\u2192v\u221e) \ufb01xed point\nast\u2192\u221e . In a second class of solutions, called limit cycles, v(t)becomeslimit cycle\nPeter Dayan and L.F. Abbott Draft: December 17, 2000\n13\nperiodic at large times and repeats itself inde \ufb01nitely. For the third class\nof solutions, the chaotic ones, v(t)never repeats itself but the trajectory of chaos\nthe system lies in a limited subspace of the total space of allowed con \ufb01gu-\nrations called a strange attractor. Chaotic solutions are extremely sensitive strange attractor\nto initial conditions.\nWe focus most of our analysis on \ufb01xed-point solutions. For v\u221eto be a\ntime-independent solution of equation 59, which is also called an equilib-rium point, we must have f\n(v\u221e)=0. General solutions of equation 59 equilibrium point\nwhen fis nonlinear cannot be constructed, but we can use linear tech-\nniques to study the behavior of vnear a \ufb01xed point v\u221e.I ffis linear, the\ntechniques we use and solutions we obtain as approximations in the non-linear case are exact. Near the \ufb01xed point v\n\u221e,w ew r i t e\nv(t)=v\u221e+/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(t) (60)\nand consider the case when all the components of the vector /epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1are small.\nThen, we can expand fin a Taylor series, Taylor series\nf(v(t))\u2248f(v\u221e)+J\u00b7/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(t)=J\u00b7/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(t) (61)\nwhere Jis the called the Jacobian matrix and has elements Jacobian matrix\nJab=\u2202fa(v)\n\u2202vb/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle\nv=v\u221e. (62)\nIn the second equality of equation 61, we have used the fact that f(v\u221e)=0.\nUsing the approximation of equation 61, equation 59 becomes\nd/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1\ndt=J\u00b7/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1. (63)\nThe temporal evolution of v(t)is best understood by expanding /epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1in the\nbasis provided by the eigenvectors of J. Assuming that Jis real and has N\nlinearly independent eigenvectors e1,..., eNwith different eigenvalues\n\u03bb1,...,\u03bb N, we write\n/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(t)=N/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1c\u00b5(t)e\u00b5. (64)\nSubstituting this into equation 63, we \ufb01nd that the coef \ufb01cients must satisfy\ndc\u00b5\ndt=\u03bb\u00b5c\u00b5. (65)\nThis produces the solution\n/epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(t)=N/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1c\u00b5(0)exp(\u03bb\u00b5t)e\u00b5 (66)\nDraft: December 17, 2000 Theoretical Neuroscience\n14\nwhere /epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1(0)=/summationtext\n\u00b5c\u00b5(0)e\u00b5. The individual terms in the sum on the right\nside of equation 66 are called modes. This solution is exact for equation 63, modes\nbut is only a valid approximation when applied to equation 59 if /epsilon1/epsilon1/epsilon1is small.\nNote that the different coef \ufb01cients c\u00b5evolve over time independently of\neach other. This does not require the eigenvectors to be orthogonal. If theeigenvalues and eigenvectors are complex, v\n(t)will nonetheless remain\nreal if v(0)is real, because the complex parts of the conjugate pairs can-\ncel appropriately. Expression 66 is not the correct solution if some of theeigenvalues are equal. The reader should consult the references for thesolution in this case.\nEquation 66 determines how the evolution of v\n(t)in the neighborhood of\nv\u221edepends on the eigenvalues of J. If we write \u03bb\u00b5=\u03b1\u00b5+i\u03c9\u00b5,\nexp(\u03bb\u00b5t)=exp(\u03b1\u00b5t)/parenleftbig\ncos(\u03c9\u00b5t)+isin(\u03c9\u00b5t)/parenrightbig. (67)\nThis implies that modes with real eigenvalues ( \u03c9\u00b5=0) evolve exponen-\ntially over time, and modes with complex eigenvalues ( \u03c9\u00b5/negationslash=0) oscillate\nwith a frequency \u03c9\u00b5. Recall that the eigenvalues are always real if Jis\na symmetric matrix. Modes with negative real eigenvalues ( \u03b1\u00b5<0 and\n\u03c9\u00b5=0) decay exponentially to zero, while those with positive real eigen-\nvalues ( \u03b1\u00b5>0 and \u03c9\u00b5=0) grow exponentially. Similarly, the oscillations\nfor modes with complex eigenvalues are damped exponentially to zero ifthe real part of the eigenvalue is negative (\n\u03b1\u00b5<0 and \u03c9\u00b5/negationslash=0) and grow\nexponentially if the real part is positive ( \u03b1\u00b5>0 and \u03c9\u00b5/negationslash=0).\nStability of the \ufb01xed point v\u221erequires the real parts of all the eigenval-\nues to be negative ( \u03b1\u00b5<0 for all \u00b5). In this case, the point v\u221eis a stable\n\ufb01xed-point attractor of the system, meaning that v(t)will approach v\u221eif it attractor\nstarts from any point in the neighborhood of v\u221e. If any real part is positive\n(\u03b1\u00b5>0 for any \u00b5), the \ufb01xed point is unstable. Almost any v(t)initially in unstable \ufb01xed point\nthe neighborhood of v\u221ewill move away from that neighborhood. If fis\nlinear, the exponential growth of |v(t)\u2212v\u221e|never stops in this case. For\na nonlinear f, equation 66 only determines what happens in the neighbor-\nhood of v\u221e, and the system may ultimately \ufb01nd a stable attractor away\nfrom v\u221e, either a \ufb01xed point, a limit cycle, or a chaotic attractor. In all\nthese cases, the mode for which the real part of \u03bb\u00b5takes the largest value\ndominates the dynamics as t\u2192\u221e . If this real part is equal to zero, the\n\ufb01xed point is called marginally stable. marginal stability\nAs mentioned previously, the analysis presented above as an approxima-\ntion for nonlinear differential equations near a \ufb01xed point is exact if the\noriginal equation is linear. In the text, we frequently encounter linear equa-tions of the form\n\u03c4dv\ndt=v\u221e\u2212v. (68)\nThis can be solved by setting z=v\u2212v\u221e, rewriting the equation as dz/z=\nPeter Dayan and L.F.

(70)\nIn some cases, we consider discrete rather than continuous dynamics de-\n\ufb01ned over discrete steps n=1,2,... through a difference rather than a\ndifferential equation. Linearization about equilibrium points can be usedto analyze nonlinear difference equations as well as differential equations,and this reveals similar classes of behavior. We illustrate difference equa-tions by analyzing a linear case, difference equation\nv\n(n+1)=v(n)+W\u00b7v(n). (71)\nThe strategy for solving this equation is similar to that for solving differ-\nential equations. Assuming Whas a complete set of linearly independent\neigenvectors e1,..., eNwith different eigenvalues \u03bb1,...,\u03bb N, the modes\nseparate, and the general solution is\nv(n)=N/summationdisplay\n\u00b5=1c\u00b5(1+\u03bb\u00b5)ne\u00b5 (72)\nwhere v(0)=/summationtext\n\u00b5c\u00b5e\u00b5.

Here, we present a slightly more formal treatment. At the heart ofprobability theory lie two sets; a sample space,\n/Omega1and a measure. We be- sample space\nprobability measuregin by considering the simplest case in which the sample space is \ufb01nite. In\nthis case, each element \u03c9of the full sample space /Omega1can be thought of as\none of the possible outcomes of a random process, for example one resultsof rolling \ufb01ve dice. The measure assigns a number\n\u03b3\u03c9to each outcome \u03c9,\nand these must satisfy 0 \u2264\u03b3\u03c9\u22641 and/summationtext\n\u03c9\u03b3\u03c9=1.\nWe are primarily interested in random variables (which are infamously random variable\nneither random nor variable). A random variable is a mapping from arandom outcome\n\u03c9to a space such as the space of integers. An example is\nthe number of ones that appear when \ufb01ve dice are rolled. Typically, a capi-\ntal letter, such as S, is used for the random variable, and the corresponding\nlower case letter, sin this case, is used for a particular value it might take.\nThe probability that Stakes the value sis then written as P[S=s]. In the\ntext, we typically shorten this to P[s], but here we keep the full notation\n(except in the following table). P[S=s] is determined by the measures of\nthe events for which S=sand takes the value\nP[S=s]=/summationdisplay\n\u03c9with\nS(\u03c9)=s\u03b3\u03c9.

Then, add a refractory period to the model byallowing the \ufb01ring rate r\n(t)to depend on time. Initially, r(t)=r0.\nAfter every spike, set r(t)to zero. Allow it to recover exponentially\nback to r0by setting r(t+/Delta1t)=r0+(r(t)\u2212r0)exp(\u2212/Delta1t/\u03c4ref)after\nevery simulation time step /Delta1tin which no spike occurs. The con-\nstant\u03c4refcontrols the refractory recovery rate. Initially, use \u03c4ref=10\nms. Compute the Fano factor and coef \ufb01cient of variation, and plot\nthe interspike interval histogram for spike trains generated withouta refractory period and with a refractory period determined by\n\u03c4ref\nover the range from 1 to 20 ms.\n2. Plot autocorrelation histograms of spike trains generated by a Pois-\nson generator with A) a constant \ufb01re rate of 100 Hz, B) a constant\n\ufb01ring rate of 100 Hz and a refractory period modeled as in exer-\ncise 1 with \u03c4ref=10 ms, and C) a variable \ufb01ring rate r(t)=100(1+\ncos(2\u03c0t/25 ms))Hz. Plot the histograms over a range from 0 to 100\nms.\n3. Generate a Poisson spike train with a time-dependent \ufb01ring rate\nr(t)=100(1+cos(2\u03c0t/300 ms ))Hz. Approximate the \ufb01ring rate\nfrom this spike train by making the update rapprox\u2192rapprox+1/\u03c4approx\nevery time a spike occurs, and letting rapprox decay exponentially,\nrapprox\u2192rapprox exp(\u2212/Delta1t)/\u03c4 approx), if no spike occurs during a time\nstep of size /Delta1t. Make a plot the average squared error of the esti-\nmate,/integraltext\ndt(r(t)\u2212rapprox(t))2as a function of \u03c4approx and\ufb01nd the value\nof\u03c4approx that produces the most accurate estimate for this \ufb01ring pat-\ntern.\n4. Using the same spike trains as in exercise 3, construct estimates of\nthe\ufb01ring rate using square, Gaussian, and other types of window\nfunctions to see which gives the most accurate estimate.\n5. For a constant rate Poisson process, every sequence of Nspikes oc-\ncurring during a given time interval is equally likely. This seemsparadoxical because we certainly do not expect to see all Nspikes\nappearing within the \ufb01rst 1% of the time interval. Yet this seems as\nlikely as any other pattern. Resolve this paradox.\n6. Build a white-noise stimulus. Plot its autocorrelation function and\npower spectrum, which should be \ufb02at.

Construct two spiking models using an estimate of the \ufb01ring rate\nand a Poisson spike generator.

In both cases, use a Poisson generator to produce\nspikes at the rate rest(t). Compare the responses of the two models\nto a variety of time-dependent stimuli including approximate white-noise, and study the responses to both slowly and rapidly varyingstimuli.\n8. Use the two models constructed in exercise 7, driven with an ap-\nproximate white-noise stimulus, to generate spikes, and computethe spike-triggered average stimulus for each model.

Construct a model complex cell that is disparity tuned but insensi-\ntive to the absolute position of a grating. The complex cell is con-structed by summing the squares of the responses of two simplecells, but disparity effects are now included. For this exercise, weignore temporal factors and only consider the spatial dependence ofthe response. Each simple cell response is composed of two termsthat correspond to inputs coming from the left and right eyes. Be-cause of disparity, the spatial phases of the image of a grating in thetwo eyes,\n/Phi1Land/Phi1R, may be different. We write the spatial part of\nthe linear response estimate for a grating with the preferred spatialfrequency ( k\n=K) and orientation ( /Theta1=\u03b8=0) as\nL1=A\n2(cos(/Phi1L)+cos(/Phi1R))\nassuming that \u03c6=0 (this equation is a generalization of ??).

We find a strong relationship between increases in unemployment and voting for nonmainstream parties, especially populist ones. Moreover, unemployment increases in tandem with declining trust toward national and European political institutions, though we find only weak or no effects of unemployment on interpersonal trust. The correlation between unemployment and attitudes toward immigrants is muted, especially for their cultural impact. To explore causality, we extract the component of increases in unemployment explained by the precrisis structure of the econ-omy, in particular the share of construction in regional value added, which is strongly related both to the buildup preceding and the bursting of the crisis. Our results imply that crisis-driven economic insecurity is a substantial deter -\nminant of populism and political distrust.\nAspecter is haunting Europe and the West\u2014the specter of populism. \nRecent populist events include the United Kingdom\u2019s vote to exit the \nEuropean Union, the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the \nConflict of Interest Disclosure: Yann Algan received financial support for this work from \nthe European Commission\u2019s Horizon 2020 program under European Research Council Consolidator Grant no. 647870.

In France, Le Pen\u2019s National Front rose to prominence in \nthe 2014 European elections and in the first round of the 2015 regional \nelections.\nThe rise of populism in the European Union\u2019s member countries is \nimportant for many reasons. The EU is a historically unprecedented supra-\nnational unification project (Spolaore 2013). It has been successful in preserving peace and in integrating the \u201cperiphery\u201d countries of Southern \nand Eastern Europe into the European democratic model (Gill and Raiser \n2012). However, the economic crisis has uncovered shortcomings in the \ndesign of European economic and political institutions. As we demonstrate \nin this paper, Europeans appear dissatisfied with local and EU politicians \nand institutions. And this distrust fuels\u2014and in turn is reinforced by\u2014the \nrise of political extremism.\nThere are two potential explanations for the decline of trust toward  \nthe EU, the rise of Eurosceptic populists, and the electoral successes of \nradical-left and far-right parties. The first one is a cultural backlash against \nprogressive values, such as cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism, and a \nshift toward national identity. The second explanation emphasizes economic \ninsecurity, stemming from either globalization and technological progress \n(typified by outsourcing, increased competition from low-wage countries, \nand automation) or the sharp increase in unemployment in Europe in the \naftermath of the recent global financial and economic crisis. Although \nthese two explanations are not mutually exclusive and certainly interact, \nmuch of the public debate has been about the cultural backlash. This paper \nexplores the economic roots of populism, focusing on the impact of the \nGreat Recession.\nThe recent crisis has had a major impact on the European economy. \nThe EU-wide unemployment rate increased from 7 percent in 2007 to  \n11 percent in 2013. Unemployment dynamics have been uneven. After \na short-lived spike in 2008\u201309, unemployment in Germany fell to pre-\ncrisis levels; in Greece and Spain, it climbed above 20 percent. There has \nbeen substantial heterogeneity in unemployment dynamics within the EU \nperiphery and core (often associated with Germany and its neighboring \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 311\neconomies), and even within countries. For example, in 2016 the national \nunemployment rate in the United Kingdom was 5 percent\u2014lower than in \n2007. However, in the median NUTS 2 region, the unemployment rate \nwas 2 percentage points higher than before the crisis.1 In Northern Greece, \nunemployment in 2012\u201314 hovered around 30 percent, while in the Aegean \nSea and Ionian Sea islands, it fluctuated between 15 and 21 percent, as tourism mitigated the shock of the crisis. Likewise, unemployment in Italy \nin 2012\u201315 ranged from 6 to 7 percent in the North (Trento, Veneto, and \nFriuli-Venezia Giulia) to above 20 percent in the South (Campania, Calabria, \nand Puglia).\nWe show that the differential impact of the crisis explains the rise of \nantiestablishment, often populist, parties, and also the respective drop in \ntrust toward political parties and the European Union. Globalization in gen-\neral and the EU in particular have been successful in promoting growth \nbut have not done as well in sharing the gains. Large parts of society \nhave felt left behind and have risen against the establishment, national, and European institutions. The recent vintage of populism unites far-right \nand radical-left politicians in their criticism of the continent\u2019s elites and of \nthe cross-border integration that these elites represent. In some cases, the \nrise in unemployment fuels support for far-left parties, such as Podemos in \nSpain; in other cases, it encourages far-right nationalistic and xenophobic \nparties, as in Hungary and the Netherlands. Sometimes, rising unemploy-\nment fuels support for both radical-left and ultraright nationalistic parties \nthat increasingly coordinate, for example, the coalition between Syriza and \nthe Independent Greeks.\nWe first conduct a descriptive analysis of the evolution of unemploy-\nment, voting, and trust beliefs across Europe before and after the crisis, \nshowing that the economic crisis has unfolded in tandem with a political \ntrust crisis and the rise of populist, antiestablishment voting.\nSecond, we study the relationship between unemployment and voting for \nantiestablishment (radical-left, far-right, populist, and Eurosceptic) parties \n1. NUTS stands for nomenclature des unit\u00e9s territoriales statistiques, or nomenclature \nof territorial units for statistics. The NUTS classification system is a geocode standard for \nreferencing subdivisions of countries for statistical purposes. The standard is developed and regulated by the European Union, and thus covers the member states of the EU in detail. For each EU member country, a hierarchy of three NUTS levels is established by Eurostat in agreement with each member country; the subdivisions in some levels do not necessarily correspond to administrative divisions within the country. The EU regulation establishing the NUTS system (Regulation [EC] No. 1059/2003) designates average population sizes for the three NUTS levels as follows: NUTS 1, between 3 million and 7 million; NUTS 2, between 800,000 and 3 million; NUTS 3, between 150,000 and 800,000.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n312 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\nat the subnational level. We compare the regions that greatly suffered from \nthe crisis with those that weathered the crisis relatively well\u2014controlling \nfor pan-European and country group\u2013specific time trends. We document \nthat rising voting shares for antiestablishment, especially populist, parties \nfollow increases in unemployment. It is the change in unemployment\u2014\nrather than its level\u2014that correlates with voting for nonmainstream parties; \nthis novel\u2014to the best of our knowledge\u2014result echoes the findings of the literature on the role of economic losses in self-reported well-being and \nhappiness (Layard 2005).\nOur methodology accounts for time-invariant regional factors and  \nunobserved country group dynamics; however, the estimates may pick up \nsome regional, time-varying variables that are unobserved or hard to account \nfor. We thus develop a two-stage least squares (2SLS) approach that extracts  \nthe component of unemployment explained by the precrisis specialization  \nof the regional economy, and in particular the share of construction. Because  \nconstruction and real estate played a major role both during the buildup pre-\nceding and the bursting of the crisis around the world, we use the precrisis  \nshare of construction (real estate and housing) as an instrument for regional unemployment. The 2SLS estimates show the considerable causal effects of \nthe rise of unemployment (explained by the precrisis structure of the regional  \neconomy) on voting for nonmainstream parties: A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with an increase in voting \nfor the antiestablishment parties of 2 to 4 percentage points. Although pre-\ncrisis specialization is not fully exogenous, we show that the nexus between \nthe construction share, unemployment, and voting does not seem to reflect \nother time-varying regional features, such as immigration or education.\nWe then use the vote of the citizens of the United Kingdom in the June \n2016 referendum to stay in or leave the European Union (known as Brexit) \nas an \u201cout-of-sample\u201d test of the Europe-wide results. The analysis shows \nthat increases in unemployment during the crisis period 2007\u201315 (rather \nthan the level of unemployment in 2015) are strong predictors of the Brexit vote. We find similar results in 2SLS specifications that use the precrisis \nshare of construction across the United Kingdom\u2019s 379 electoral districts to \ninstrument for the subsequent spike in regional unemployment.\nThird, we examine the impact of the recession on political and general \ntrust and on beliefs about the role of immigrants, using individual-level data from the European Social Survey. There is a statistically and economically \nsignificant relationship between regional unemployment and a decline in \ntrust toward the European Parliament and national parliaments. The rela-\ntionship between regional unemployment and interpersonal trust is weaker, \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 313\nand is not always significant. Increases in unemployment correlate signifi-\ncantly with distrust toward the courts, but not with trust toward the police. \nThe 2SLS estimates are similar; the component of the rise in unemployment \ndue to the precrisis share of construction is a significant correlate of distrust \ntoward European and national institutions.\nFourth, we exploit the individual-level nature of the data to explain the \nunderlying forces of votes for antiestablishment parties. The results hold for both men and women, and for both younger and older cohorts. The \nestimates are somewhat stronger and more precise for older cohorts, in line \nwith anecdotal evidence on their antiestablishment voting. The relationship \nbetween unemployment and distrust toward political institutions is stron-\nger for non\u2013college graduates, a result in line with the findings of other \nresearchers\u2014including David Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson (2016); Autor and others (2017); Yi Che and others (2016); and Italo \nColantone and Piero Stanig (2016)\u2014who relate populist voting and politi-\ncal polarization to depressed wages among unskilled workers, fueled by \nrising competition from low- and middle-income countries.\nI. Related Literature\nOur paper is related to several strands of the literature\u2014first and foremost, \nto the research on the political economy of populism that studies the ori-\ngins and implications of populist parties and policies.2 Rudiger Dornbusch \nand Sebastian Edwards (1991) discuss the macroeconomics of populism in Latin America, whereas Dani Rodrik (2017) provides a generic discus-\nsion of the recent rise of populist parties and interprets it in the light of \neconomic theory. Recent theoretical research on the political economy \nof populism includes the work of Daron Acemoglu, Georgy Egorov, and  \nKonstantin Sonin (2013); Sharun Mukand and Rodrik (2017); Luigi Guiso and others (2017); and Rafael Di Tella and Julio Rotemberg (2016).\nA number of recent empirical papers study populism\u2019s correlates or  \norigins in specific contexts. Sascha Becker, Thiemo Fetzer, and Dennis \nNovy (2017) examine the main correlates of the Brexit vote across U.K. \ndistricts, looking at dozens of socioeconomic indicators; they find that sig- \nnificant correlates include low levels of education and low income, historical  \nreliance on manufacturing, and to a lesser extent unemployment, though there is no strong relationship with the levels of immigration. Colantone and  \nStanig (2016) show that globalization in general\u2014and import competition \n2. For reviews, see Gidron and Bonikowski (2013) and Mudde and Rovira Kaltwasser \n(2017).

This is in \nline with the findings of Autor and others (2016, 2017) and Che and others \n(2016), who show rising political polarization and a higher likelihood of \npro-Trump voting in U.S. counties that were affected the most by China\u2019s \naccession to the World Trade Organization.3 Colantone and Stanig (2017) \nuncover a similar link between import competition and support for nation-alistic, right-wing parties across EU regions. Similarly, Christian Dippel, Robert Gold, and Stephan Heblich (2016) reveal a link between import \ncompetition from China and voting for far-right parties in Germany over \nthe period 1997\u20132009.\nUsing opinion surveys from many European countries, Catherine De Vries \nand Isabell Hoffmann (2016) provide additional evidence that the fear of \nglobalization is a decisive factor behind the demands for changes away from \nthe political mainstream. Although this fast-growing strand of the literature \nfocuses on the medium-term origins of political populism or extremism \n(mostly related to trade and immigration),\n4 we examine the impact of the \ndeep economic crisis that hit Europe during the period 2008\u201309 (and also the United States and other industrial countries) and the subsequent crisis \non the European periphery (mostly over the years 2009\u201313).\nWe show that large economic downturns fuel political polarization.\n5  \nIn this regard, our work relates to empirical studies quantifying recov-\nery after severe (typically short-term) economic downturns, and banking, \ncurrency, and balance of payment crises. Recent papers by Kenneth Rogoff \n(2016) and Antonio Fat\u00e1s and Lawrence Summers (2016) connect sluggish \n3. Jensen, Quinn, and Weymouth (2017) also document a correlation between import \ncompetition from China and Mexico and employment in low-skill services with voting against \nthe incumbent.\n4. Recent works examining the impact of immigration on voting for antiestablishment or \nnationalistic parties include those by Hatton (2016); Becker and Fetzer (2017); Mayda, Peri, and Steingress (2016); and Barone and others (2016). Dinas and others (2016) study the link between refugee flows and voting for far-right parties in Greece. Dehdari (2017) connects economic distress and immigration to voting for far-right parties in Sweden.\n5. Stock (1984) presents cross-county regression evidence that the rising indebtedness of \nAmerican farmers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was related to political unrest and voting for populist candidates. De Bromhead, Eichengreen, and O\u2019Rourke (2013) connect voting with the severity of economic contraction in the interwar period (1919\u201339). Studying 171 elections in 28 countries, they find that the depth and duration of the crisis are related to the rise of far-right parties. Tabellini (2017) shows that the influx of immigrants in the United States in the interwar period fueled the success of conservative politicians and sup-port for anti-immigrant legislation, although rising immigration increased locals\u2019 wages and employment. In parallel work, Matakos and Xefteris (2017) present cross-country evidence that though mild recessions foster support for mainstream parties, large economic downturns fuel antiestablishment voting.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 315\nrecoveries to precrisis trends. Our main finding\u2014that the sharp increase in \npolitical extremism and the associated drop of trust toward political institu-\ntions are correlated with the severity of the economic downturn\u2014offers a  \nplausible mechanism explaining the long-lasting consequences of economic crises. Our results thus complement the findings of Manuel Funke, Moritz \nSchularick, and Christoph Trebesch (2016), who, studying 20 advanced \neconomies over the years 1870\u20132014, document with panel regressions that  \nfinancial crises increase political polarization, raise fragmentation in the \nparliament, and spur political unrest (see also Matakos and Xefteris 2017).\nThe closest papers to ours are the parallel studies by Guiso and others \n(2017), Ronald Inglehart and Pippa Norris (2016), and Christian Dustmann \nand others (2017).\n6 Guiso and others (2017) study the demand for and sup-\nply of populism, both empirically and theoretically. They document a link between individual-level economic insecurity and distrust toward political \nparties, voting for populist parties, and low electoral participation. They also  \nshow that parties shift their agendas to cater to voters\u2019 preferences in response to economic insecurity (an interesting aspect that we do not address).  \nInglehart and Norris (2016) also use individual-level survey data and argue that the rise of populism reflects cultural rather than economic factors.\nUnlike these two studies, we use actual region-level voting data rather \nthan self-reported information from surveys (which have much smaller \nregional coverage and may be subject to reporting biases). We focus on the \nimpact of crises, in particular the sizable rise in regional unemployment \nafter the 2008\u201309 financial crisis. We develop an instrumental variables \napproach to identify causal effects, and we associate regional industrial \nspecialization, especially the precrisis boom in construction, with the rise \nin antiestablishment voting in the aftermath of the crisis. Although our \ninstrumental variables strategy does not fully exploit random, exogenous \nvariation, the reduced-form link between construction and voting is an \ninteresting result by itself, because it connects the precrisis boom with cur -\nrent developments. In contrast to Inglehart and Norris (2016), we find that economic insecurity explains a substantial share of the rise in populism \nwhen controlling for time-invariant factors.\n7\n6. Hern\u00e1ndez and Kriesi (2016) report cross-country evidence of a link between the \nseverity of the Great Depression and the electoral losses of incumbent parties.\n7. Our results are consistent with De Vries (forthcoming) that the rise of populism mir -\nrors a shift from a left/right to a cosmopolitan/parochial divide; regions with a larger increase \nin unemployment are more likely to have a negative attitude toward immigrants, mostly because of their impact on the economy and not because of their alien cultural identity (see also Hobolt and De Vries 2016).\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n316 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\nWe diverge from Inglehart and Norris (2016) in two main ways. First, \nwe look at the effect of the within-region variation of unemployment on \ninstitutional trust and populism, accounting for time-invariant factors and \nlooking at actual votes. Our analysis shows that voting for nonmainstream \nparties (and Brexit) and political distrust stem from increases in unemploy-\nment during the crisis, rather than the level of unemployment. Second, \nwe take a different perspective on what we consider to be cultural values  \nand attitudes. Although Inglehart and Norris (2016) explain populism \nby the (presumably exogenous) rise of institutional distrust, we show \nthat the increase in distrust itself stems directly from the crisis. We show \nthat, because economic insecurity increases populist voting and spurs  \ndistrust toward political institutions and dissatisfaction with democracy, the changes in the latter variables cannot be considered independent drivers of the former.\n8\nOur result suggests that the cultural backlash and economic insecurity \nexplanations are connected. Economic insecurity has a direct impact on \nvalues and beliefs. However, these values might also in turn amplify \nor mediate the effects of economic shocks. In particular, we find that \nthe older generations are experiencing a larger decline in trust than the \nyounger generations, although the latter have suffered more from the \nrise in unemployment during the crisis. One plausible explanation is that \nthe older generations have more conservative or traditional values and \nare more sensitive to changes in the economic environment. Thus, our \ncontribution to the debate about the cultural hypothesis is mainly to bring in \nother aspects, in particular economic factors, to explain the rising support \nfor populism.\nIn concurrent research, Dustmann and others (2017) also use the Euro-\npean Social Survey and uncover the fact that unemployment (and GDP) \nshocks at the regional level are accompanied by a trust deficit (defined as \nthe ratio of political to general trust). Dustmann and others (2017) further \nshow that regional unemployment correlates with nonmainstream voting \nin European Parliament elections. These results complement our findings \nfrom national parliamentary and presidential elections, which are more \nimportant, given that the European Parliament has rather limited authority. \nMoreover, our sample is noticeably larger (for voting outcomes, we have \n226 regions, versus Dustmann and others\u2019 132). We also uncover a link \n8. The caveat holds for most of the variables considered as independent by Inglehart \nand Norris (2016), such as attitudes toward immigration, demand for authority, and political \norientation. Unemployment affects these beliefs directly.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 317\nbetween precrisis construction share, rise in unemployment, and postcrisis \nvoting, which suggests that the precrisis boom plays a role to the recent spike \nof populism.\nOur paper also contributes to the large body of research linking trust \n(as well as civic-mindedness, social capital, and beliefs) with economic per -\nformance.9 Although there has been extensive research on the implications \nof trust and social or civic capital for various aspects of economic perfor -\nmance (Tabellini 2010; Algan and Cahuc 2010), the literature on their ori -\ngins is relatively limited. Building on Robert Putnam\u2019s (1993) influential \nwork, empirical papers study the long-run impact of important historical \nepisodes\u2014for example, the culture of city-states in medieval Italy (Guiso, \nSapienza, and Zingales 2016a), the role of Africa\u2019s slave trade (Nunn and \nWantchekon 2011), and the role of communism and the secret police in East \nGermany (Jacob and Tyrell 2010). Our paper contributes to this research \nin several ways. To start with, instead of looking at long-run determinants, \nwe study the impact of the 2008\u201309 financial and economic crisis. In this \nsense, our work is conceptually close to that of Maxim Ananyev and Sergei \nGuriev (2015), who provide evidence linking the severity of the 2009 crisis in Russia with general trust levels. Although the literature has focused on \ninterpersonal trust, we look at trust toward political institutions\u2014including \nthe courts, the police, political parties, and the European Union\u2014which has \nbeen a largely unexplored dimension. We show that trust toward institutions \nis much more volatile and is influenced more by short-term fluctuations than \ninterpersonal trust.\nOur analysis of the role of business cycles in institutional trust echoes \nthat of Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers (2011), who study the relation -\nship between the 2008\u201309 crisis and trust toward the financial system across U.S. states. The link between unemployment and political or insti-\ntutional distrust is also related to research on the interactions between \ncultural norms or beliefs and institutions (Alesina and Giuliano 2015). We \ndocument that institutional trust is the critical element for understanding \npolitical preferences and voting behavior.\nOur paper also contributes to research on the political economy of \nthe European Union. Until recently, policymakers and economists have \nfocused on economic convergence\u2014discussing the issues of debt, defi-\ncits, and inflation. However, the European crisis has shifted attention to \n9.

Guiso, Helios Herrera, and Massimo Morelli (2016) stress \ncultural differences between Northern and Southern European coun-\ntries and argue that future integration (with common enforcement) is \nneeded to confront the \u201ccultural clash.\u201d However, Alberto Alesina, Guido  \nTabellini, and Francesco Trebbi (2017) show that what is striking in the \nEU is the high degree of within-country (rather than cross-country) het-\nerogeneity in beliefs and trust. Applying simple variance decomposi-\ntions on various cultural proxies from the World Values Survey during \nthe period 1980\u20132007, Alesina, Tabellini, and Trebbi (2017) show that \nwithin-country variation dwarfs between-country variability, a pattern that is similar across U.S. states. They show that the degree of cultural \nheterogeneity both across and within EU countries was similar to that \nin the United States, an allegedly efficient and well-functioning political \nand currency union.\nMarie Lechler (2017) studies the impact of employment shocks on  \nanti-EU sentiment using regional, industry-specific employment shocks \nand individual-level Eurobarometer survey data over the period 1996\u2013\n2014. She applies panel data and instrumental variables methods to \nidentify a strong impact of employment changes on anti-EU sentiment, \nespecially among the unemployed and the unskilled. Our paper comple-\nments these works by studying the impact of the crisis on both atti-\ntudes toward Europe and the rise in populism. We find that the crisis has \nstopped the process of cultural convergence within Europe. The rise in \nunemployment goes hand in hand with a fall in political trust and a rise \nin political extremism and populism, thereby creating additional strains \nwithin the EU.\nFinally, our finding that changes in economic conditions, and not their \nlevels, is what matters is related to the \u201chappiness\u201d literature and the well-\nknown Easterlin paradox of a small correlation between income and happi-\nness in rich countries (Easterlin 1974, 2013; Kahneman and Deaton 2010; \nStevenson and Wolfers 2008).

We \nfind a similar relationship between unemployment and institutional trust \nand political attitudes.\nII. Data and Descriptive Analysis\nIn this section, we describe our data and discuss summary statistics.\nII.A. Data Description\nWe use three main types of data. First, we compile regional unemploy-\nment and output statistics at the NUTS 2 level of geographical aggregation \nfrom Eurostat. We also use Eurostat to extract information on the shares of \nsix broad sectors\u2014construction, agriculture, finance, government, manu-\nfacturing, and trade and commerce\u2014in gross value added. The data cover  \n217 regions in 25 countries (we do not have information on industrial com-  \nposition for Switzerland). Throughout this paper, we group the 26 coun-\ntries (including Switzerland) in our sample into four broad regional  \ncategories. The North comprises Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The South includes Cyprus, \nGreece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain. The Center consists of Austria, Belgium, \nFrance, Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. And the East (the for -\nmer post-Soviet transition countries) is composed of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia.\n12\nSecond, we collect voting data for parliamentary and presidential \nelections using country-specific archives. We then obtain information on \npolitical parties\u2019 orientation using the Chapel Hill Expert Survey and online \nresources (which in turn follow Hix and Lord 1997). Although the Chapel \nHill Expert Survey details many party attributes, it does not cover all par -\nties. We have identified and classified the remaining parties based on their platforms from their websites. We focus on four aspects of antiestablish-\nment politics: (i) far-right, often nationalistic, parties, such as the Golden \nDawn in Greece and the National Front in France; (ii) radical-left parties, \nsuch as Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece; (iii) populist parties, such \n11. For a literature review on the adaptation and habituation effect for well-being, see \nClark, Frijters, and Shields (2008).\n12. For robustness, we also report estimates in a sample of 11 countries at the NUTS 3 level.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n320 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\nas the Party for Freedom in the Netherlands and the U.K. Independence \nParty; and (iv) Eurosceptic and separatist parties, such as the Five Star \nMovement in Italy and the True Finns in Finland. These four categories \nare not mutually exclusive (with the exception of radical-left and far-\nright parties). Most populist parties are Eurosceptic, with a correlation \nof .76. The correlations of Euroscepticism with far-right and radical-left \nparties are .51 and .42, respectively. The correlation between populist and far-right parties is .52, and between populist and radical-left parties \nit is .55.\n13\nAfter matching the electoral data with parties\u2019 political orientations, we \ncalculate the percentage of votes cast for parties in each of the four ori-\nentations over the total valid votes at each election for each region. We \nalso sum the votes of all types of nonmainstream parties, classified as far-\nright, radical-left, populist, and Eurosceptic or separatist.14 We also study \nthe dynamics of turnout, defined as the percentage of voters as a proportion of registered voters.\nThird, we use individual-level data on trust, attitudes, and beliefs from \nthe European Social Survey (ESS), conducted biennially, from 2002 until \n2014. The ESS covers 32 European nations; we exclude Israel, Russia,  \nTurkey, and Ukraine. We also drop Croatia and Lithuania, as there are no surveys for them before the crisis, and Luxembourg, which lacks a post-\ncrisis survey. There have been seven rounds of the ESS (in 2002, 2004, \n2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014). The panel is not balanced, because the \nESS has not been carried out in all countries for all waves. Unfortunately, \nwe miss the latest rounds from Greece and Italy, which have suffered con-\nsiderably from the crisis. The ESS sample covers 186 NUTS 2 regions in \n24 countries. The ESS administrators interview residents, regardless of their \nnationality, citizenship, language, or legal status. On average, each country-\nround survey covers approximately 2,000 individuals. The ESS asks ques-\ntions on beliefs along various dimensions, such as the role of immigrants \n13. The Chapel Hill Expert Survey database contains much information on parties\u2019 polit-\nical platform that we do not use, the reason being incomplete coverage. Another limitation is \nthat our classification does not reflect small movements in political ideology of mainstream  \nparties or the election of radical candidates through mainstream parites. However, if main-stream parties also take in some extremist views or embrace populist polices, then our estimates will be conservative (Colantone and Stanig 2017; Inglehart and Norris 2016). Guiso, Herrera, and Morelli (2016) develop a model of the response of established parties to \nvoters\u2019 beliefs and the emergence of new parties.\n14. Throughout, we use \u201cantiestablishment\u201d and \u201cnonmainstream\u201d interchangeably.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 321\nand minorities, trust toward the courts and the police, and beliefs about the \nrole of government. We focus on general trust and trust toward political \ninstitutions (politicians, national parliaments, the European Parliament, the \nUnited Nations, national courts, and the police). We also examine questions \nreflecting respondents\u2019 self-identified positions on the left\u2013right continuum, \nsatisfaction with democracy, and beliefs about whether the EU has gone \ntoo far. Because the variables have different scales, we standardize them to range between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating more trust. For \nthe baseline analysis, we average across NUTS 2 regions for each ESS \ncountry-round, though we also use the data at the individual level when we \nexamine heterogeneity.\nThe online appendix provides details on data coverage.\n15 Table 1 pre-\nsents summary statistics for the main variables at the regional level, distin-\nguishing between the precrisis period (2000\u201308) and the postcrisis period \n(2009\u201316). In the next subsections, we provide a descriptive analysis of \npatterns in the data.\nII.B. Unemployment, Voting, and Trust before and after the Crisis\nREGIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT The left panel of figure 1 plots the evolution of \nunemployment (for individuals between 15 and 64 years of age) between 2000 and 2016. Precrisis unemployment was below 10 percent across all \ncountry groups. Unemployment rates in the South and the East were about \n8 or 9 percent; in the Center, 6.5 to 7 percent; and in the North, 5 to 6 per -\ncent. Unemployment increased during the global financial crisis (2008\u201310) across all countries. However, the spike in the core was moderate, while in \nthe South unemployment rates doubled. In Greece, unemployment (across \n13 NUTS 2 areas) jumped from 9 percent in 2007 to 27 percent in 2013, \nand then fell to around 24 percent. Mean unemployment across Spain\u2019s  \n19 NUTS 2 regions jumped from 8.2 percent (median, 8.2 percent) in 2007 to 26.1 percent (median, 26.1 percent) in 2013, and then dropped to about \n20 percent.\nThe distribution of regional unemployment rates in the right panel of \nfigure 1 illustrates the increase in the mean and variance. Compared with \nthe precrisis distribution, the distribution of postcrisis unemployment has \na long right tail, indicative of the very high unemployment rates in some \nregions of the South.

It grows in Spain (Podemos) and  \nGreece (Syriza), and to a lesser extent in Portugal (Bloco de Esquerda) and \nFinland (Vasemmisto). It falls in Slovakia (Communist Party of Slovakia), \nItaly (Communist Refoundation Party), and France (Workers\u2019 Struggle). \nMean (median) voting for far-right parties goes from 11 percent (4 per -\ncent) to 12 percent (7 percent). The rise of far-right parties mostly comes from the North and Center (rather than the South and Eastern European countries), where the increase is about 6 percent. The rise of far-right \nparty voting is considerable in Hungary (an increase of approximately \n20 percent) and Greece (an increase of 9 percent). V oting for populist par -\nties increases considerably; the mean moves from 17 to 25 percent, while the median increases from 13 to 23 percent. This increase is strong in the \nSouth, North, and Center. Only in the former transition countries does the mean share for populist parties not go up considerably, as the sizable \nincrease in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland is offset by declines \nin Estonia, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia. Eurosceptic parties are also \non the rise. The mean (median) vote increases by 6 percent (13 percent). \nThis rise is strong in the South, where the mean and median both increase \nby 17 percent, and in the North, where the mean (median) increases from \n17 percent (12 percent) to 23 percent (19 percent).\nTRUST AND BELIEFS Let us start with the evolution of general trust. If any-\nthing, interpersonal trust across European regions has increased somewhat \nsince the crisis. Though the increase in the mean and median has been \nsmall, this pattern applies to all measures of general trust (see the fourth \ngroup of rows in table 1).\nThe situation vis-\u00e0-vis trust toward political institutions is very different.  \nThere is a sharp decline in the trust toward national political systems in the \npostcrisis period. The mean value of trust toward national parliaments falls  \nby 0.3 (from 0.45 to 0.42 on a 0\u20131 scale), roughly half the precrisis standard deviation. As the top left panel of figure 3 shows, after 2008 the distribu-\ntion moves to the left. There is also a significant drop in a similar question  \nreflecting trust toward politicians. The top right panel of figure 3 shows that distrust is not limited to the political system; it extends to the legal system,  \nthough to a lesser extent. The South drives this result. In the former transition countries, there is no movement, but in the countries of the European core,  \ntrust toward national courts slightly increases. Interestingly, trust toward the police moves in the opposite direction, increasing with the crisis (bottom left  \npanel of figure 3). Distrust toward political parties and national courts reflects dissatisfaction with the functioning of democratic institutions, driven mostly  \nby the South, where mean satisfaction falls from 0.55 to 0.40.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 327\nSources: European Social Survey; authors\u2019 calculations. \na.

The postcrisis dis-\ntribution of trust toward the European Parliament has a long left tail \n(bottom right panel of figure 3). As Europeans\u2019 trust toward the EU has \nbeen falling, their views on whether the EU should go further or whether \nit has gone too far, have, on average, also changed (third group of rows \nin table 1). We also tabulate the distribution of trust toward the United \nNations. Distrust toward the UN may capture antiglobalization sentiment or overall dissatisfaction with international institutions, but it does not \nhave the European angle. There is some decline in trust toward the UN, \nbut it is smaller relative to the drop in trust toward the EU. The sizable \ndrop in trust toward the EU and domestic institutions is in line with the \nEurobarometer survey data (Foster and Frieden 2017).\nWe also examine political positioning on the left\u2013right continuum and \ncloseness to a particular party. There is no indication that Europeans are, on average, moving to the left or to the right, but there is a small decline of \nrespondents\u2019 closeness to a particular party.\nBecause antiestablishment, nationalistic, and populist parties often \nembrace antiminority or anti-immigration agendas, we examine the evo-\nlution of variables reflecting Europeans\u2019 beliefs about immigration. The \nfourth group of rows in table 1 gives means and medians pertaining to \nimmigration before and after the crisis. ESS data show no major change \nin attitudes toward immigrants\u2014or even a more welcoming stance. On \naverage, Europeans are more likely to allow immigration of the same \nor different races (increases from 0.59 to 0.61, and from 0.50 to 0.53, \nrespectively). They also appear ready to welcome immigrants from \npoorer countries, and still believe that immigrants make the country a \nbetter place to live (an increase of 2 percentage points, from 48 percent \nbefore the crisis).\nIII. The European Crisis and the Rise of Populism\nIn this section, we analyze the effect of unemployment on voting for nonmainstream parties and on turnout. First, we report the within-\nregion correlations that assess whether the European crisis and the rise \nof anti establishment vote are related. Second, we discuss an instrumen-\ntal variable approach that helps identify causal effects and report the 2SLS estimates. Third, we carry out an \u201cout-of-sample\u201d test of the link \nbetween the crisis and populist voting, associating regional differences \nin unemployment across the United Kingdom during the crisis and  \nBrexit voting.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 329\nIII.A. Ordinary Least Squares Estimates\nWe examine the effect of unemployment on the four types of anti-\nestablishment vote and turnout rate, using two closely related approaches \nthat exploit the variation in NUTS 2 regions over time.17\nFirst, we run panel fixed effects specifications that explore within-region \nvariation over time. We use the full sample period that extends from 2000 until the middle of 2017 (including the recent elections in France, the \nNetherlands, Bulgaria, and the United Kingdom).\n18 Table 2 reports the \nresults. In the top rows, we include year dummies to account for general \ntrends in unemployment and voting patterns across the EU. Because there \nare not many elections in a given year, we run specifications with four sub-\nperiod dummies. We split the sample into two precrisis periods (2000\u201304 \nand 2005\u201308) and two postcrisis periods (2009\u201312 and 2013\u201317). The \ntable\u2019s middle rows present the results. In the bottom rows, we interact the \nperiod dummies with the country group dummies to allow for differential \ndynamics in unemployment and voting across the South, Center, East, and \nNorth of Europe.\nSecond, we carry out difference-in-differences estimations that associate \npre- and postcrisis differences in the various electoral outcomes with the \nrespective differences in regional unemployment. Specifically, we average \nall observations after the crisis (2009\u201317) and before the crisis (2000\u201308) \nand then estimate the model in differences.19 Table 3 presents these esti-\nmates. In the top rows, we do not include any controls, while in the bottom rows, we add country group dummies that account for differential precrisis \nand postcrisis changes in unemployment and voting.\nLet us first discuss the within-region correlation between total anti-\nestablishment vote (that is, the vote for radical-left, far-right, populist, and \n17. Ideally, we would want to run the specifications at the electoral district level to \naccount for strategic voting and other unobserved issues inherent in proportional or majori-\ntarian systems, for instance. However, we lack data on output and unemployment at the elec-toral district level. As Colantone and Stanig (2017) show, NUTS 2 regions include (in most countries) more than one electoral district. The analysis at the NUTS 3 level of aggregation that we conduct for a subsample of the countries partially addresses this, as electoral districts sometimes overlap with NUTS 3 level districts.\n18. The specification is as follows: y\nr,c,t = a + bUr,c,t + ar + dt + er,c,t. Here, y denotes non-\nmainstream party vote in region r in country c in period t, and U denotes the regional unem-ployment rate. (In some specifications, we use lagged unemployment and other controls.)\n19. The difference specification is: Dy\nr,post \u2013 pre  = a + bDUr,post \u2013 pre  + er, where Dy and DU \ndenote changes in regional nonmainstream party vote and unemployment over the postcrisis period (mean over 2009\u201317) and the precrisis period (mean over 2000\u201308). Dropping 2008 altogether or assigning it to the postcrisis period does not change the results in any way.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTable 2.

The unemployment coefficient is \nsignificant in all the rows of table 2. There is a one-to-one relationship \nbetween unemployment and antiestablishment voting. The before/after \nspecification in column 1 of table 3 yields an estimate that is statistically \nsignificant and similar in magnitude. The link between unemployment and \nantiestablishment voting is strongest in the South (where the crisis has been \nthe deepest), and is considerable in the East (the magnitude is 0.5); but it is weak in the North and the Center (the results for the four country groups  \nare available on request). The top left panel of figure 4 illustrates the before/after correlation, distinguishing between NUTS 2 regions across the main \nmacro regions.\nIn columns 2 and 3 of tables 2 and 3, we separately assess the role of \nunemployment in voting for radical-left and far-right parties. The results in table 2\u2019s middle rows suggest that higher unemployment fuels voting \nfor radical-left parties. A similar pattern emerges in the top rows of table 3.\nThe results change, however, when we add country group\u2013specific period  \neffects (bottom rows of tables 2 and 3). The estimates are now compa-\nrable in magnitude (both in the panel and difference specifications), but \nthe coefficients for radical-left and Eurosceptic parties are no longer sig-\nnificant; the coefficient on unemployment is statistically significant in the  \nvoting for far-right and populist parties. We further examine the rela-tionship between unemployment and specific types of antiestablishment  \nvoting in each of the four main macro regions (the results are available on request). The link between unemployment and the far-right vote is stronger \nin the South and somewhat weaker in the East. In contrast, the relationship \nbetween unemployment and the radical-left vote is quite heterogeneous. \nIt is strong in the South (with the rise of Podemos in Spain and Syriza in \nGreece), positive in the North, insignificant in the Center, and negative \nand significant in the former transition countries, where people seem to \nturn their backs on communist parties, and instead lean toward right-wing \nnationalists.\nIn column 4 of tables 2 and 3, we examine voting for populist parties. \nIn all specifications, coefficients are positive and highly significant. The \nresults from the before/after crisis estimations are also highly significant (table 3), as shown also in the middle right panel of figure 4.

The coefficients on unemployment in the \ntop and middle rows of table 2 and the top rows of table 3 are statistically \nsignificant, and are not far from 1. The bottom panel of figure 4 illustrates this pattern; while the positive relationship between unemployment and \nthe Eurosceptic vote pertains in all four macro regions, once we account \nfor differential macro region trends, the estimates drop and lose signifi-\ncance. In column 6 of tables 2 and 3, we focus on turnout. An increase in \nunemployment of 5 percentage points (1 standard deviation) is associated \nwith a decrease in turnout of 2.5 percentage points (about 0.2 standard deviation). The difference specifications yield less clear, though similar, \nresults. The correlation is present in the top row of table 3, but once we \naccount for different trends in the North, South, East, and Center, it loses \nsignificance.\n20\nCRISIS AND RECESSION We also examine the correlation between unem-\nployment and antiestablishment voting, dropping regions with very high or considerable increases in unemployment (which are mostly in the South). \nThis is useful both to assess the outliers and to examine whether the rela-\ntionship between unemployment and voting outcomes emerges only in \nseverely crisis-hit regions. The correlation retains statistical significance \nwhen we exclude high-unemployment regions (the top 5 percent or even \nthe top 10 percent, with rises of unemployment exceeding 8.5 percent), \nthough the estimate drops. When we drop the top 25 percent, the estimate \ndrops further (to about 0.5) and becomes statistically insignificant (with  \nt statistics of about 1.3 to 1.5). This suggests that it is the severity of the \ncrisis and the associated sharp increase in unemployment that fuel sup-\nport for nonmainstream parties (for associated cross-country results, see \nMatakos and Xefteris 2017).\nNUTS 3 ANALYSIS To further account for unobservable time-invariant  \nfeatures, we estimate specifications at a finer regional level. We aggregate \nthe voting data at NUTS 3 regions; using data from Cambridge Economet-\nrics on employment rates, we rerun the analysis for 363 regions in 11 coun-\n20. Using ESS data, Guiso and others (2017) estimate \u201cselection\u201d models that jointly \nassociate unemployment with turnout and voting. They also find that unemployment and \neconomic insecurity are associated with a fall in turnout.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 335\ntries.21 Table 4 presents the results. The elasticity of nonmainstream party \nvoting with regard to employment is \u20131. This is mostly driven by voting for \npopulist parties. When we allow for differential time trends in the core and \non the periphery, we obtain attenuated estimates, because most of the varia-  \ntion comes from the differences between regions on the periphery and in the  \ncore. Yet the effects are still statistically significant. The results remain intact \nwhen we add country group\u2013specific time effects (online appendix table 2).\nIII.B. Instrumental Variables Estimation\nThe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates linking unemployment with \nvoting do not necessarily imply a causal relationship. By exploiting within-region variation, we control for all time-invariant features shaping voting \nfor nonmainstream parties and unemployment. However, we cannot rule \nout the fact that omitted time-varying regional factors drive the correlation. \nAnother potential problem is reverse causation, though few would argue \nthat it was the rise in populist and Eurosceptic voting (and the decline in \npolitical trust, discussed in the next section) that led to the downturn of \n2008\u201310 and the deep recession on the European periphery. Yet another \nconcern is errors-in-variables that is likely to be nonnegligible. Unemploy-\nment statistics are noisy; they do not account well for part-time employ-\nment and for those workers who are only marginally attached to the labor \nforce. Moreover, official statistics miss activities in the shadow economy, \nwhich may be important in the South and the East.\nTo explore causality, we develop an instrumental variables approach \nthat uses the share of construction in regional value added as an excluded, \nBartik-style instrument.\n22 Construction and real estate played a key role \nin the buildup to the 2008\u201309 financial crisis and its severity (Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde, Garicano, and Santos 2013; Fern\u00e1ndez-Villaverde and Ohanian  \n2009; Lane 2014; Reis 2015). The rise of construction and real estate services was important in the precrisis boom in Spain, Ireland, Portugal, \nGreece, the United Kingdom, Cyprus, and some Eastern European coun-\ntries, contributing to misallocation and asset price inflation (Gopinath and \nothers 2017).\n21. These countries are Austria (with 35 regions), Bulgaria (28), Czech Republic (14), \nGreece (51), Spain (59), France (100), Hungary (20), Ireland (8), Norway (19), Sweden (21), \nand Slovakia (8). We use employment\u2013population ratios for this analysis because unemploy-ment rates are not available at the NUTS 3 level.\n22.

First, the share \nof construction in the regional economy affects unemployment, even when \naccounting for other sectoral shares. Below, we show that this is indeed the \ncase. Second, the share of construction should affect voting (trust and beliefs) \nonly via its impact on unemployment. In the before/after specifications, \nthe precrisis share of construction in regional value added should affect the \nchanges in voting (and other outcomes) via its impact on the increase in regional unemployment.\nAlthough directly testing the \u201cexclusion restriction\u201d is not possible, it \nseems reasonable that the primary impact of changes in regional specializa-\ntion on voting and attitudes is via unemployment, especially in the short \nterm, on which we are focusing. Construction may affect voting via alter -\nnative mechanisms, for example, via corruption, immigration, or human \ncapital. Though we cannot fully rule out these channels, we provide evi-\ndence below that they are unlikely to be important in our case.\nThe average share of construction in regional value added in our sample \nis 6.5 percent (the median is 7 percent). Together with agriculture, it is \none of the less important broad sectors in our sample (see table 1). There-\nfore, swings in the share of construction are less likely to be endogenous to \nunobserved features that may affect voting and trust. There is substantial  \ncross-sectional variation in the share of construction; the range across the 227 regions in 2007 is from 2.35 to 15.25 percent. The within-country \nvariation is also large. The construction share in Greece ranges from 6.3 to  \n11.4 percent; in Germany, from 2.1 to 6.2 percent; in Italy, from 4.8 to  \n7.9 percent; and in Belgium, from 2.8 to 7.8 percent.\nFIRST-STAGE RESULTS: CONSTRUCTION AND UNEMPLOYMENT We start with an \nexamination of the first-stage relationship between unemployment and the share of construction in regional value added. Table 5 reports the results. \nThe top rows present panel specifications with region fixed effects and year \ndummies (in columns 1 and 2) and country group\u2013specific year effects  \n(in columns 3 and 4). The coefficient on the share of construction is highly significant. The most conservative estimate is in column 4, where we allow \nfor different trends across the country groups and control for regions\u2019 \nindustrial composition, which implies that an increase of 1 percentage point \nin the share of construction is associated with a drop in unemployment of \n0.93 percentage point. This translates into a standardized beta coefficient \nof about 0.3.\n23 The top panels of figure 5 plot the correlation between the \n23. In online appendix table 3, we use lagged values of construction and other industry \nshares.

The relationship is significant in all \ncountry groups.\nIn the bottom rows of table 5, we focus on the impact of the crisis. The \ndependent variable is the difference in regional unemployment between \nthe precrisis and postcrisis periods. For the postcrisis period, we take the \naverage over 2009\u201316; and for the precrisis period, we use the 2000\u201308 mean. The main independent variable is the precrisis share of construc-\ntion. Because sectoral shares are noisy and there are gaps in the Eurostat \ndata, we use the 2004\u201307 mean.\n24 A higher precrisis share of construction \nis associated with an increase in regional unemployment after 2008\u201309. The coefficient on the precrisis share of construction is significant, implying that \nregional specialization in construction in the boom years 2002\u201307 contrib-\nuted to the rise in unemployment after 2008\u201310. The estimate in column 4 \nof table 5 is 0.67 (standardized beta of 0.29), which is quite similar to the \nspecifications in the full panel.\n25 The bottom panels of figure 5 illustrate the \nrelationships between postcrisis and precrisis differences.\nREDUCED-FORM ESTIMATES: CONSTRUCTION SHARE AND VOTING OUTCOMES   \nWe now turn to the reduced-form specifications that associate voting patterns \nwith the precrisis share of construction. Table 6 reports the panel estimates. \nThere is a strong relationship between the share of construction in the \nregional economy and the voting share of the antiestablishment parties. \nThis result holds in all specifications. The coefficients in column 1 imply \nthat an increase of 1 percentage point in the share of construction is associ-\nated with an increase of approximately 3 percentage points in the antiestab-\nlishment vote. The effect is strongest for populist parties (with a coefficient \n24. In online appendix table 4, we show that using 2007 or earlier years yields similar \nthough attenuated coefficients.\n25. In online appendix table 5, we regress changes in unemployment over various peri-\nods (2008\u201316, 2008\u201315, 2008\u201314, 2008\u201313, and 2008\u201312) on the precrisis share of construc-\ntion (conditional on other sectoral shares and country group fixed effects). The initial share of construction always enters with a negative coefficient that is larger (and more precisely estimated), when we look at the immediate aftermath of the crisis. The coefficient on the ini-tial construction share when we focus on changes in unemployment over the 2008\u201312 period  \nis 0.64; it declines to 0.40 for 2008\u201315 and to 0.27 for 2008\u201316. As the European econo-\nmies recover from the recession of 2009\u201312, the role of the precrisis construction weakens. \nLikewise, we associated five-, six-, and seven-year changes in regional unemployment to the initial share of construction. Construction enters with a significantly positive coefficient only when we look at postcrisis versus precrisis windows.

There is no effect on turnout.\nOne may wonder whether the voting outcomes are associated with \nthe share of some other sectors (rather than construction). We reestimate \nall the specifications in table 6, controlling for all sectoral shares. Online \nappendix table 6 reports the panel estimates that associate voting patterns \nfor nonmainstream parties and turnout with the shares in regional value added of construction, agriculture (including forestry, fishing, and mining), \ntrade, government, and finance (with manufacturing serving as the omitted \ncategory).\n26 The construction share enters all specifications with a nega-\ntive coefficient that is usually statistically significant. The coefficient on the regional construction share in explaining voting for antiestablishment \nparties in column 1 of online appendix table 6 is \u20133.2, quite similar to the \nunconditional estimate. Furthermore, no consistent pattern emerges regard-\ning the link between voting for nonmainstream parties and the shares of \nother sectors.\nWe also estimate reduced-form before/after crisis specifications; these \nspecifications, reported in table 7, associate changes in voting patterns \nbefore and after the crisis with the precrisis share of construction (con-\nditional also on country group dummies and/or shares of all other sectors \nin regional value added). The merit of the difference specifications is that \nthe precrisis share of construction is less likely to affect changes in voting \ndirectly or through channels other than its impact on regional unemploy-\nment. We find that the precrisis share of construction correlates with pre-\ncrisis versus postcrisis changes in nonmainstream party voting.\n27\nTWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATES  Table 8 presents 2SLS estimates that \ncombine the reduced-form estimates with the first-stage results. The top \nsection presents 2SLS panel fixed effects estimates, controlling for period. \nIn the second section, we control for the share of agriculture, finance, com-\nmerce, and government services in regional value added. In the third and \nfourth sections, we include country group\u2013specific period dummies that \naccount for differential trends across Europe in unemployment, regional \nspecialization, and voting.28\n26. We also reestimated the panel specifications using lagged values of construction and \nother sectors. The results are similar and not reported for brevity.\n27.

The 2SLS coefficient is somewhat higher than \nin OLS. An increase in unemployment of 1 percentage point is associated \nwith an increase of 2 to 4.4 percentage points in the share of the anti-\nestablishment vote. The effect is strongest for populist parties. We find no \nsignificant impact of unemployment on voter turnout. The difference spec-ifications in table 9 yield similar\u2014albeit somewhat smaller\u2014estimates.  \nA 1 percentage point higher share of construction before the crisis is associ-ated with an increase in the vote share of the antiestablishment parties of \n1.3 to 2.4 percentage points.\n29\nIDENTIFICATION ISSUES AND INSTRUMENT VALIDITY CHECKS The reduced-\nform link between the share of construction in regional value added and \nvoting patterns and the strong relationship between construction and \nunemployment do not necessarily imply a causal nexus between construc-\ntion, unemployment, and nonmainstream voting. The necessary condition \nfor causality is that construction does not affect voting directly or via other \nchannels besides unemployment. It is impossible to test this condition for -\nmally, given that the structure of the regional economy is not random and is related to various socioeconomic factors that can also affect political \noutcomes. In this subsection, we examine several alternative explanations.\nThe first alternative explanation relates to corruption. It is possible that \nconstruction, a sector dependent on government connections, promotes \nbribery, which in turn affects voting for nonmainstream parties.\n30 Given that \nthe ESS includes three corruption perception questions (though only in the 2004 round), we examine the link between the share of construction and \nself-reported perceptions of corruption. As reported in online appendix \ntable 8, we fail to detect any significant correlation.\nThe second potential mechanism involves education. Construction is not \na skill-intensive sector; thus, regions specializing in construction or experi-\nencing increases in construction may have lower levels of human capital. In \nthis case, the 2SLS estimates may pick up the role of education. Columns 1  \nthrough 3 of table 10 report panel and difference 2SLS specifications, \n29. Online appendix table 7 reports similar specifications; but because the rise of \npopulist, radical-left, and far-right parties occurred after the crisis, we associate changes \nin antiestablishment voting from 2004\u201307 to 2013\u201317 with the corresponding changes in unemployment instrumented with the precrisis construction share. The 2SLS coefficients are similar.\n30.

To further assuage endogeneity  \nconcerns, we use lagged values. The 2SLS estimate is unaffected by the inclusion of college attainment, which is not uncorrelated with voting and \nconstruction, once we include regional fixed effects. The precrisis share \nof postsecondary education is also unrelated to subsequent changes in \nunemployment and voting. Therefore, the 2SLS estimates are similar.

The results are similar when we add \ncountry group\u2013specific time constants and control for other sectoral shares \n(online appendix table 9).\nThe third alternative explanation pertains to a potential link between \nconstruction and immigration. The construction sector in richer economies often employs immigrants from low- and middle-income countries. Using \ndata on net migration from Eurostat, we estimate 2SLS models, including  \nan indicator that takes the value of 1 for regions experiencing positive net migration flows (and 0 otherwise). Columns 4 through 6 of table 10 \ngive the results (see also online appendix table 9). Construction appears to  \nbe unrelated to net migration, as the 2SLS estimates are unaffected by the inclusion of these controls.\n31 We also estimate models controlling for  \nthe share of ESS respondents who were born in the country and who are not citizens. Although such data are available only for eight countries, \nthe 2SLS unemployment coefficient retains its economic magnitude and \nstatistical significance (online appendix table 10).\nFinally, we examine whether there are precrisis trends in voting for non-\nmainstream parties and regional sectoral specialization. Precrisis voting \nfor nonmainstream parties (during 2000\u201307) is unrelated to the share of \nconstruction at the onset of the crisis, in 2007\u201308 (results are not shown for \nthe sake of brevity).\nIII.C. Unemployment and Brexit\nMOTIVATION One of the quintessential examples of the rise of populism \nin Europe was the U.K. referendum on leaving the European Union. The \nJune 23, 2016, referendum resulted in a majority (52 percent) for leaving \nthe EU. There is no clear definition of pro- and anti-Brexit party alignment, \nand this vote seems to have transcended party lines. The ruling Conservative \n31. The results are similar if we do not transform the net migration data or if we use log \nmigration inflows and outflows (these results are available upon request).\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 349\nParty split between \u201cLeavers\u201d and \u201cRemainers.\u201d The situation was similar, \nthough less stark, in the Labour Party. Although many Labour politicians \nwere active in the Remain campaign, the party\u2019s leader, Jeremy Corbin, was \nlukewarm; eventually, Brexit did well in traditional Labour districts. We \nthus carry out an analysis of the Brexit vote in an \u201cout-of-sample\u201d fashion. \nWe consider the relationship between the vote in Britain\u2019s 379 electoral \ndistricts and the change in unemployment before and after the crisis.32\nORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATES Column 1 of table 11 shows the cor -\nrelation between the Brexit vote share and unemployment in 2014 (both are expressed in percentage points). The coefficient is marginally significant, \nand its magnitude is rather moderate. A rise in unemployment of 1 standard \ndeviation (2 percentage points) increases the \u201cleave\u201d vote by 1 percent-\nage point. The share of variation explained by unemployment is small. In \ncolumn 2, we add dummies for Greater London, Scotland, and Wales (with \nEngland being the omitted category). The significance of unemployment \nincreases. The statistically significant (although economically small) rela-\ntionship between unemployment and the Brexit vote echoes the findings of \nBecker, Fetzer, and Novy (2017) with respect to the correlates of Brexit.\nIn columns 3 and 4 of table 11, we report regressions where the indepen-\ndent variable is the difference in the district\u2019s unemployment rate averaged \nover the 2008\u201314 and 2002\u201306 periods, respectively (the average increase \nin unemployment in the U.K. electoral districts was 2 percentage points). \nThe relationship is much stronger for the change in unemployment. An \nincrease in the change in unemployment of 1 standard deviation (1 percent-age point) results in an increase of 4 to 5.5 percentage points in the Brexit \nvote. Unemployment performs more strongly in changes than in levels, \nwhen we include both variables (results not shown). Figure 6 provides \nan illustration.\nTWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATES To approximate the causal impact \nof the change in unemployment during the crisis on the Brexit vote, we instrument the change in unemployment (over 2008\u201314) with the precrisis \nshare of construction. To reduce noise, we average the share of construc-\ntion in districts\u2019 employment for the period 2005\u201308 (the results are similar \nwhen we use 2007). The construction share ranges from 3 to 15 percent. \nAs shown in columns 5 and 6 of table 11, there is strong first-stage fit; the \n32.

Approach and Specification\nWe assess the impact of the economic crisis on trust, attitudes, and \nbeliefs, employing two related approaches. First, using all ESS rounds, \nwe estimate panel specifications with regional fixed effects. This is key, \ngiven that the literature on the origins of trust\u2014and on culture, more gen-\nerally\u2014has established the importance of time-invariant or slow-changing  \nlocal factors, including geography (Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn 2013; Buggle and Durante 2017) and history (Tabellini 2010). Second, we \nexplore the relationship between changes in trust, attitudes, and beliefs \nand changes in unemployment, both before and after the crisis. Because \nmany countries recovered from the recessions by 2012, we estimate the \ndifference specifications using two pre- and postcrisis periods: 2008\u201314  \nand 2008\u201312.\n33\nIV.B. Ordinary Least Squares Estimates\nTable 12 presents OLS panel fixed effects estimates. In the top rows, we \ninclude ESS round dummies; and in the bottom rows, we include country group\u2013round fixed effects to account for differential trends across the \nmain European macro regions.\n34 Table 13 reports difference specifications \nwith country group dummies that account for differential group-specific \ntime trends.\nGENERAL TRUST Columns 1 through 3 of table 12 report the panel esti-\nmates with the three measures of interpersonal trust. The coefficients on unemployment are generally statistically significant in the top rows (except \nfor \u201cbelief that people are fair\u201d), though they become imprecise when we \ninclude country group\u2013round fixed effects. The estimate in the bottom rows \nof column 1 implies that an increase of 1 percentage point in regional unem-\nployment is associated with a fall in general trust of about 0.11, roughly  \n1 standard deviation. The within-region association between unemploy-ment and general trust is negative across all country groups, though it is \nsignificant only in the Eastern European countries.\n33. In the online appendix, we present the graphical before-and-after analysis, using \naverage values for 2010, 2012, and 2014 for the postcrisis period and average values from \n2004, 2006, and 2008 for the precrisis period.\n34. We have estimated specifications with region fixed effects and country-year fixed \neffects that account for differential trends on unemployment and trust. There is not much variation on unemployment and beliefs within countries in a given year; thus, in general, this approach yields coefficients that are noisy and much more attenuated.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 353\nThe before-and-after specifications given in table 13 suggest that \nunemployment and general trust are only weakly related. The 2008\u201314 \nspecifications yield significantly negative coefficients, though the co-\nefficients in the 2008\u201312 specifications are smaller in absolute value and \ninsignificant. \nThe top panels of figure 7 illustrate the before-and-after correlation \nbetween general trust (and whether people are helpful) and unemployment, when we pool postcrisis (2010, 2012, and 2014) and precrisis (2004, 2006, \nand 2008) observations. The slope is small and statistically indistinguish-\nable from 0, implying the link between regional unemployment and general \ntrust is weak.\nTRUST TOWARD POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS Given the relationship between \nunemployment on voting for antiestablishment parties, we examine its \nrole vis-\u00e0-vis trust toward political institutions. Columns 4 through 8 of \ntables 12 and 13 report the estimates.\nPolitical trust. The panel estimates yield negative and highly significant \ncoefficients, showing a strong link between unemployment and political \ndistrust. The coefficients drop by half when we include country group\u2013\nround dummies, implying that though a sizable part of the negative asso-\nciation between unemployment and political trust stems from comparing \ncountries in the core with Southern and Eastern Europe, the link is present \nin all groups of countries. An increase of 5 percentage points in unemploy-\nment is associated with a drop of 1.5 percentage points in political trust, a \nconsiderable effect, given that the latter\u2019s standard deviation is 11 percent-\nage points (table 1). The standardized beta coefficients are about \u20130.15, \ntwice as large as the corresponding coefficients with the proxies of general \ninterpersonal trust. The specifications in table 13 also yield statistically \nsignificant estimates. The spike in unemployment is accompanied by a \nrise in political distrust. The middle panels of figure 7 give a graphical \nillustration of the before-and-after patterns in regional unemployment and \npolitical trust, when we average the variables over 2010\u201314 (postcrisis) \nand over 2004\u201308 (precrisis). The regression line is steep, and the correla-\ntion is present in all groups of countries.\nTrust toward the legal system and the police. Column 6 of tables 12 \nand 13 shows that unemployment is related to distrust toward the legal sys-tem. The panel estimate is highly significant. The coefficient falls and loses \nsignificance once we add country group\u2013round effects, suggesting that the \nlink is driven by the considerable variability between core and periphery \ncountries. When we estimate models by country groups, we get significantly \nnegative estimates for Eastern and Northern European countries (and \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nTable 12.

In the \ndifference-in-differences specifications, the coefficient on unemployment \nis negative and significant in the 2008\u201312 model (144 regions in 19 coun-\ntries), but is insignificant in the 2008\u201314 specification (133 regions in  \n16 countries). Overall, there seems to be a relationship between the severity of the crisis and distrust toward the legal system, though this relationship \nis less strong than the one for distrust toward politicians. In contrast to the link between the change in unemployment and the change in trust toward \nthe legal system, there is no significant relationship between the intensity \nof the crisis and trust toward the police. This applies to both the panel and \nthe difference specifications.\nTRUST TOWARD THE EUROPEAN UNION In an effort to shed light on the \ndrivers of the relationship between unemployment and Eurosceptic voting, \nwe use the ESS question on trust toward the European Parliament as a \nproxy for anti-EU sentiment. The ESS also asks Europeans about their trust \ntoward the UN. Because the UN is an institution of global\u2014rather than \nEuropean\u2014governance, we use trust toward the UN as a placebo.\nThe panel estimates in column 8 of the top rows of table 12 yield a nega-\ntive correlation between unemployment and trust toward the European Par -\nliament (coefficient = \u20130.33). The bottom left panel of figure 7 provides an illustration. In contrast, there is no systematic link between unemployment \nand trust toward the United Nations, shown in column 9, implying that the \nestimates given column 8 do capture resentment toward the EU rather than \ntoward all international institutions. When we add the country group\u2013round \ndummies, the coefficient becomes marginally insignificant, as most of the \nvariation comes from the difference between the main European macro \nregions. The negative correlation between unemployment and trust toward \nthe European Parliament is strong in the Eastern European countries but is \ninsignificant in the Center and in the South. The difference specifications \nare similar; changes in trust toward the EU are correlated with changes in \nregional unemployment. There is no robust correlation between changes in \nunemployment and changes in trust toward the United Nations (bottom right \npanel of figure 7).\nPOLITICAL ATTITUDES We also examine the correlation between unemploy -\nment and political attitudes and beliefs.\nThe specification in column 10 of table 12 shows that regional unemploy-\nment correlates strongly with people\u2019s dissatisfaction with democracy. \nThe standardized beta coefficient that quantifies the change in satisfaction \nwith democracy to an increase of 1 standard deviation in unemployment \nis \u20130.29 (controlling for country group\u2013round fixed effects), almost five \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n358 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\ntimes larger than the respective values for interpersonal trust. This pattern \nis present in almost all country groups, and it is especially strong in the core \nand former transition countries. The specifications in column 10 of table 13 \nreveal a one-to-one link between changes in regional unemployment and \nchanges in satisfaction with democracy. The ESS also asks respondents \nabout their satisfaction with the government, the state of the economy, and \ntheir life in general. Regional unemployment correlates strongly with all these variables, and especially dissatisfaction with the economy and with the \ngovernment. Therefore, the patterns shown in tables 12 and 13 do not nec-\nessarily imply that Europeans residing in regions with high unemployment \nhave nondemocratic beliefs. However, there seems to be a metastasis from \neconomic disparity and dissatisfaction with the economy to a more general \ndissatisfaction with democracy, and with the inability of institutions to protect people against economic risks during the crisis.\nWe next examine whether unemployment has moved people to the left \nor to the right on the political spectrum. As shown in column 11 of tables 12  \nand 13, there is not much evidence of a relationship between unemploy-ment and self-reported left\u2013right political orientation. This applies in both \nthe panel and the difference specifications, and is due to considerable \nhetero geneity. In some countries, unemployment moves people to the right \n(for example, Poland, and, to a lesser extent, France and Germany), while in others, unemployment moves voters to the left (for example, Portugal). \nWe also examine related questions, for example, whether respondents \nsupport more redistribution or whether they prioritize security, again \nfailing to detect robust patterns (the results are not shown for the sake  \nof brevity).\nThe specifications in column 12 show that the link between unemploy-\nment and distrust reflects a feeling by crisis-hit Europeans that no politi-cal party is close to them. This pattern is strong in Central and Northern \nEurope and in the former transition countries; it is absent from the South, \nwhere people seem to align closely to radical-left and far-right parties. The \nstandardized beta coefficient (\u20130.15) implies an economic effect that is as \nstrong as the one with distrust toward politicians and national parliaments \n(though more noisy).\nWe also examine the impact of unemployment on beliefs about European \nintegration, using a question that reads: \u201cSome say European unification should go further. Others say it has already gone too far. . . . What number \non the scale [where 10 indicates unification should go further and 0 indi-\ncates unification has already gone too far] best describes your position?\u201d \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 359\nOn average, changes in unemployment are related neither to the view that \nthe EU has gone too far nor to attitudes that EU unification should proceed \nmore aggressively. This nonresult masks important heterogeneity. In the \nSouth, people hope for deeper integration. In contrast, in the North and \nin the Center, the correlation is negative and significant; in more crisis-hit \nregions of the European core, respondents believe that the European project \nhas gone too far.\nATTITUDES TOWARD IMMIGRANTS We now examine whether unemploy-\nment has affected attitudes toward immigrants. This is important, because \u201csafeguarding\u201d the country from immigration is a crucial element of the \npopulist rhetoric (for example, the Front National in France, the U.K.  \nIndependence Party, and Golden Dawn in Greece). Tables 14 and 15 give panel fixed effects and before-and-after specifications for all immigration-\nrelated questions.\nThe panel specifications in columns 1 through 3 of table 14 (top rows) \nyield weak associations. Interestingly, there is a small \u201cracial bias,\u201d given \nthat the unemployment coefficients are larger, in absolute value, for \nimmigrants from different countries than for the majority ethnic or racial \ngroup and for non-EU countries. Yet the coefficients are not statistically \nsignificant. The specification in column 4 establishes a positive relation-\nship between unemployment and Europeans\u2019 views that immigration has \na negative impact on the economy. The standardized beta coefficient is \nlarge (\u20130.39). In contrast, there is no association between unemployment \nand respondents\u2019 views on immigrants\u2019 role in the country\u2019s cultural life \n(column 5), suggesting that economic\u2014rather than cultural\u2014explanations \nare at play.\nWhen we add country group\u2013round dummies, the negative correlations \nbetween regional unemployment and attitudes toward immigration turn \nsignificant. The bottom rows of table 14 further reveal the strong economic insecurity component of anti-immigration sentiment. The unemployment \ncoefficient is negative and highly significant in column 4, when the ESS \nasks respondents to express their views on immigrants\u2019 impact on the \neconomy. Unemployment\u2019s correlation with views on immigrants\u2019 cultural \ncontribution is close to 0 and is statistically insignificant.

Two-Stage Least Squares Estimates\nTo estimate the causal effects of the crisis on trust and beliefs, and to \naccount for endogeneity (related to time-varying omitted variables and mea-\nsurement error), we run 2SLS specifications, using the share of construction \nin regional value added as an instrument in the panel specifications and the \nprecrisis share of construction in the difference specifications. Tables 16 \nand 17 report the 2SLS estimates (see also online appendix tables 12 and 13). \nFor brevity, in online appendix table 11 we report the reduced-form specifi-\ncations, associating trust and beliefs with construction.\nGENERAL TRUST The 2SLS panel estimates yield significant negative \ncoefficients for unemployment on general trust. Interestingly, the estimates \nare quite similar to OLS, suggesting either that endogeneity is not a major \nconcern or that upward sources of bias cancel with attenuation stemming \nfrom classical errors-in-variables. When we add country group\u2013round dum-\nmies, the coefficients decline in absolute value and become statistically \ninsignificant.

The 2SLS \ncoefficients are negative and highly statistically significant.

Once  \nwe add country group\u2013period dummies (in the bottom rows), the 2SLS \ncoefficient is \u20130.30 and statistically insignificant\u2014exactly as in the respec-\ntive OLS estimation. However, table 17 shows that changes in unemploy-\nment (instrumented with the precrisis construction share) play a significant \nrole in trust toward the legal system. In contrast, there is no systematic link \nbetween unemployment and the trust toward the police.\nTRUST TOWARD THE EUROPEAN UNION In columns 8 and 9 of tables 16  \nand 17, we examine the link between unemployment and trust toward the European Parliament and the United Nations. The 2SLS coefficient in the \npanel specifications is negative and highly significant; its magnitude (\u20130.81)  \nis larger in absolute value than the analogous OLS estimate (which was also more imprecise). A construction-driven increase in regional unemployment \nof 5 percentage points corresponds to a drop in trust toward the European \nParliament of 4 percentage points. In contrast, there is no association with \ntrust toward the UN. The 2SLS difference-in-differences specifications yield \nsimilar patterns: a significant relationship between changes in unemploy-\nment coming from the precrisis construction share, and distrust toward the Table 17.

However, we stress that unemploy-\nment correlates with dissatisfaction with the government and economic \nuncertainty and a general feeling of dissatisfaction with life, which in \nturn are collinear. Hence, it is hard to isolate the impact of unemployment \non support for democratic institutions from these related issues. The link \nbetween unemployment and political self-orientation is again weak. The \npanel estimates show that there is a significant second-stage relationship \nbetween unemployment (instrumented by the construction share) and a dis-\nconnect from the political system (column 12 of table 16).

However, the only robust and statis-\ntically significant coefficient in the more efficient panel estimates is on the \nquestions asking Europeans about whether immigration is harmful for the \neconomy. There is no relationship with the perceived impact of immigrants \non the country\u2019s cultural life. These results emphasize the importance of \neconomic insecurity as the main driver of populism.\nIV.D. Heterogeneity\nThe microstructure of the ESS data set allows for a finer examination of \nthe role of the crisis vis-\u00e0-vis trust, attitudes, and beliefs. We explore the \nheterogeneity of the effect identified above in an attempt to shed light on \nthe underlying mechanisms. The literature has put forward various potential \nexplanations of the rise of populist voting and the decline in political trust. \nFor example, district-level demographics and educational features seem to \ncorrelate with political extremism in the United States and the Brexit vote \n(Autor and others 2016, 2017; Becker, Fetzer, and Novy 2017; Foster and \nFrieden 2017). To explore heterogeneity, we move from regional means to \nthe individual-level ESS data; we run the specifications above separately \nfor subsamples divided by gender, age, and education.\nTable 20 presents panel OLS estimates linking regional unemployment \nwith individual-level responses on general trust (columns 1 through 3), trust \ntoward political institutions (columns 4 through 9), and political beliefs \n(columns 10 through 13). Table 21 reports panel estimates focusing on \nattitudes toward immigration. In all these specifications, we include region \n(NUTS 2) fixed effects and ESS round dummies. The standard errors are \nadjusted for two-way clustering: at the NUTS 2 level to account for serial \ncorrelation, and at the country-year level to account for residual interrelations \nacross all individuals in a given country-round.35 Running the regressions \nat the individual level is also useful to assess the robustness of the bench-\nmark OLS panel estimates to the inclusion of respondent-level character -\nistics. Following Nathan Nunn and Leonard Wantchekon (2011) and Paola Giuliano and Antonio Spilimbergo (2014), we control for age, age squared, \ngender, education, religion, marital status, and occupation. The top rows of \ntables 20 and 21 show the results for the full sample that covers more than \n100,000 individuals. These serve as the baseline estimates. Not surpris-\ningly, the regressions in the full sample of respondents yield results similar \nto the regional-level analysis.\n35. This adjustment produces larger errors as compared to clustering at the region-year \nlevel or only at one dimension.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 369\nIn the second and third rows of tables 20 and 21, we split the sample by \ngender. The panel estimates imply no substantial differences. The coefficients \nare quite similar for men and women in all the questions reported in tables 20 \nand 21, the exception being the question on political self-orientation. There \nis some evidence that, in response to rising regional unemployment, women \nare moving slightly to the left on the political spectrum, a finding consistent \nwith work showing women\u2019s higher sensitivity to social issues (Mueller 2003, chap. 23; Miller 2008).\nIn the fourth, fifth, and sixth rows of tables 20 and 21, we examine hetero-\ngeneity with regard to respondents\u2019 age, distinguishing between young \n(below 30 years), middle-age (31\u201359), and old (60 or older). These account \nfor 14, 52, and 34 percent of the sample, respectively. We do not discover \nmajor differences in the impact of regional unemployment on political trust and political beliefs between age categories (table 20). Interestingly, there \nis heterogeneity on general trust; regional unemployment is unrelated to \ninterpersonal trust in young cohorts, though the correlation is significant \nfor older respondents. Young cohorts\u2019 views about immigrants are also not \nmuch affected by regional unemployment, a nonresult that deserves future \nresearch, as the crisis has affected the young considerably (table 21).\nIn the last two rows of tables 20 and 21, we distinguish between respon-\ndents who did and did not attend college. The correlation between regional \nunemployment and political distrust is strong for both college and non\u2013\ncollege graduates (columns 4 through 9 of table 20). The same applies to \npolitical beliefs and attitudes (columns 10 through 13). There is, however, \nimportant heterogeneity in general trust (columns 1 through 3). On one \nhand, the coefficients for the college educated are small and in general are \nstatistically indistinguishable from 0. On the other hand, the coefficient on \nthe non\u2013college graduates sample is much larger in absolute value and is \nmore precisely estimated, pointing out that regional unemployment does \ncontribute to falling trust for the group of unskilled individuals.\nIV.E. Taking Stock\nTaken together, the OLS and 2SLS results imply that economic factors \ndo not affect general trust as much as trust toward political institutions.36 \nThis finding is consistent with the argument that general trust has a moral \ncomponent inherited through education and socialization. In Eric Uslaner\u2019s  \n36. Ananyev and Guriev (2015) find a substantial effect of the Great Recession on gen-\neral social trust in Russia, a country with underdeveloped political institutions relative to the \nEU. This result is similar to the one documented by Dustmann and others (2017), who link the ratio of political to interpersonal trust to unemployment.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n370 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\nTable 20.

[and] the belief that others share your funda-\nmental moral values\u201d; people extrapolate from their experiences with spe-\ncific individuals or from their background to extend trust to groups of people \nwith similar characteristics. In contrast, the European economic crisis has \nundermined trust toward political institutions at the national and European \nlevels. The fact that we do find a rise in distrust toward national and EU politicians but not toward the police or United Nations suggests that citi-\nzens have assigned the blame for the rise in unemployment to the inefficient \nnational and European institutions. The relationship between unemployment \nand distrust toward the legal system is also alarming, given that an inde-\npendent, impartial, and well-functioning legal and judicial system is a key \npillar of modern capitalist societies and democracies (Hayek 1960), guar -\nanteeing freedom (La Porta and others 2004), and promoting development  \n(La Porta, L\u00f3pez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer 2008). These findings connect to the large body of literature studying the interplay between economic growth \nand democracy.\n37 Although the literature mostly compares democracies with \nnondemocracies, our results from established democracies point out that democracy is at risk if citizens do not believe that it delivers shared prosperity.\nFinally, the relationship between unemployment and attitudes toward \nimmigration help shed light on the relative importance of the economic \nand cultural drivers of populism. The impact of unemployment on attitudes \ntoward immigration is especially strong for voters\u2019 economic concerns. \nThe crisis has shifted Europeans\u2019 views on the impact of immigrants on \nthe economy, an effect that is especially salient for individuals without a \ncollege degree, who are perhaps affected the most by the negative conse-\nquences of globalization and technological progress. Another interesting \nresult is that though the younger generations suffer the most from the \ncrisis, their attitudes toward immigrants have not moved much, most likely \nbecause of rising cosmopolitanism and open-mindedness.\nV. Policy Implications\nOur results imply that the loss of confidence in national and European political institutions and the rise of populism are related to the crisis-driven \n37. See, for example, Barro (1996, 1997), Persson and Tabellini (2006), Giavazzi and \nTabellini (2005), Acemoglu and others (forthcoming), and Papaioannou and Siourounis \n(2008a) for the effect of democratization on growth; see Barro (1999), Acemoglu and others (2008), and Papaioannou and Siourounis (2008b) for the reverse link between development and democracy.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nALGAN, GURIEV, PAPAIOANNOU, and PASSARI 375\nincrease in unemployment. This leads to yet another rationale for counter -\ncyclical macroeconomic policies preventing rising unemployment and \nattenuating its impact. Even a temporary increase in unemployment may \nresult in political fallout, which in turn would give rise to antimarket policies \nundermining long-term growth. In this case, a large downturn may have \nsustained negative economic implications.\nThe Great Recession, coupled with the relative weakness of European \ninstitutions and the indecisiveness of policymakers in coping with its severe consequences, led to a dramatic decline in citizens\u2019 confidence in political \nand even legal institutions. The literature on attitudes and preferences finds \nlasting effects of large economic downturns (Giuliano and Spilimbergo 2014; \nMalmendier and Nagel 2016); therefore, trust toward the key democratic \ninstitutions of modern capitalist economies may well have been permanently  \ndamaged.\nOur results have policy implications, because they seem vital for restor -\ning confidence in democracy and trust toward institutions, the EU, and \nnational governments. A recent address on the EU\u2019s future given by the \nEuropean Commission\u2019s president (Juncker 2017) rightly emphasizes the \nrestoration of trust\u2014however, implementation has yet to follow.\nWhat can be done to restore economic security and political trust? \nFirst, the EU should prioritize progrowth investments, such as research, \ninnovation, and public infrastructure to leverage the scale economies \nand cross-border externalities in Europe. The next Multiannual Financial \nFramework, starting in 2018\u201319, goes in this direction by making employ-\nment and growth top priorities. Second, national and EU authorities should \npursue supply-side reforms of labor, capital, and product markets (Baldwin \nand Giavazzi 2015), as well as pan-European countercyclical fiscal poli-\ncies. This will require revamping the EU budget, which remains very small \n(about 1 percent of the EU\u2019s GDP). Third, given unskilled workers\u2019 high \nvulnerability to the crisis, there is a case for targeted support of this popu-\nlation group. Education and training remain mainly the internal responsi-\nbilities of the EU\u2019s member states, but the European Social Fund and the \nEuropean Globalization Adjustment Fund should play a role as well.\n38\n38. Online appendix figure 2 illustrates the importance of social safety nets in times  \nof crisis; there is a strong positive correlation between the change of trust in the European \nParliament before and after the crisis and the change in social benefits per capita. The posi-tive cross-country correlation also holds with trust in national parliaments and satisfaction with democracy. Although this finding stems from cross-country variation (given that there are no comparable region-level data), it opens a new scope for research on public policies to protect trust and democracy in crisis times.\nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u000073.97.245.81 on Tue, 05 Oct 2021 15:17:49 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\n376 Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall 2017\nAlthough the EU needs reforms to improve its economic performance, \nthese reforms in turn can only be carried out if national and European \npoliticians preserve legitimacy and citizens\u2019 trust.

Note\u2011se que qualquer conceptualiza\u00e7\u00e3o rigorosa apontar\u00e1, por um lado, para \num fen\u00f3meno complexo e multifacetado, e, por outro, ser\u00e1 sempre pass\u00edvel de alguma \ncontesta\u00e7\u00e3o. Pela natureza do fen\u00f3meno, esta implica articular aspetos estrat\u00e9 \u2011\ngico\u2011militares e pol\u00edtico\u2011legais com aspetos tecnol\u00f3gicos e at\u00e9 econ\u00f3mico\u2011empresa \u2011\nriais. Por isso, vale a pena aqui relembrar uma reflex\u00e3o sobre a defini\u00e7\u00e3o de \nconceitos, efetuada num contexto de investiga\u00e7\u00e3o jur\u00eddica, por reinhold Zippelius. \nComo este explica, \u00abos conceitos s\u00e3o, portanto, combina\u00e7\u00f5es de tra\u00e7os comuns a \nv\u00e1rios objetos. Mas saber quais dos aspetos comuns correntes pomos em evid\u00eancia \ne abarcamos nos nossos conceitos, isso depende daquilo porque nos interessamos\u00bb4. \nou seja, \u00aba forma\u00e7\u00e3o dos conceitos orienta\u2011se pela quest\u00e3o de se saber\u00bb qual a deli \u2011\nmita\u00e7\u00e3o em que os \u00abconceitos servem melhor os objetivos da investiga\u00e7\u00e3o para que \ns\u00e3o formados\u00bb5. No caso da ciberguerra, vejamos algumas das mais relevantes pro \u2011\npostas de conceptualiza\u00e7\u00e3o at\u00e9 agora efetuadas.\nrela\u00e7\u00f5eS iNterNaCioNaiS  mar\u00e7o : 2012   33 056COnCEPTUALIZA\u00c7 \u00f5ES\tESTRAT\u00c9 gICO\u2011MILITARES \tDE\tCIbERgUERRA\nem Ciberwar is Coming! , John arquilla e David ronfeldt procuraram tra\u00e7ar pioneiramente \nos contornos do conceito de \u00abciberguerra\u00bb ( cyberwar ). est\u00e1vamos, ent\u00e3o, nos prim\u00f3rdios \nda sociedade em rede tal como hoje a conhecemos, em termos de uso da internet, da \nweb, de comunica\u00e7\u00f5es m\u00f3veis e de outras tecnologias digitais. Para clarificarem a sua \nconceptualiza\u00e7\u00e3o, estes procuraram destrin\u00e7ar o conceito de ciberguerra de outros \npr\u00f3ximos, nomeadamente daquilo que estes designaram como \u00abinfoguerra\u00bb ( netwar ). \nQuanto a esta \u00faltima, a infoguerra, foi definida como \n\u00abum conflito relacionado com a informa\u00e7\u00e3o a um grande n\u00edvel, entre estados ou socie \u2011\ndades. Significa tentar desarticular, danificar ou modificar o que uma popula\u00e7\u00e3o \u201csabe\u201d, \nou pensa que sabe, sobre ela pr\u00f3pria e o mundo \u00e0 sua volta. a infoguerra pode focalizar\u2011se \nna opini\u00e3o p\u00fablica, ou na elite, ou em ambas. Pode envolver medidas de diplomacia \np\u00fablica, propaganda e campanhas psicol\u00f3gicas, subvers\u00e3o cultural e pol\u00edtica, induzir em \nengano ou interferir com os m\u00e9dia locais, ou infiltra\u00e7\u00f5es em redes de computadores e \nbases de dados e esfor\u00e7os para promover movimentos dissidentes e de oposi\u00e7\u00e3o atrav\u00e9s \ndas redes de computadores. assim, conceber uma estrat\u00e9gia para a infoguerra significa \nreunir em conjunto, sob uma nova perspetiva, um conjunto de medidas que j\u00e1 foram \nusadas anteriormente, mas eram vistas de forma separada. Por outras palavras, a info \u2011\nguerra representa uma nova entrada no espectro do conflito que abrange formas de \n\u201cguerra\u201d econ\u00f3mica, pol\u00edtica, social e militar. em contraste com guerras econ\u00f3micas que \nt\u00eam como alvo a produ\u00e7\u00e3o e a distribui\u00e7\u00e3o de bens, e as guerras pol\u00edticas que t\u00eam como \nalvo a lideran\u00e7a e as institui\u00e7\u00f5es do governo, as infoguerras distinguir\u2011se\u2011\u00e3o por procu \u2011\nrarem atingir a informa\u00e7\u00e3o e comunica\u00e7\u00e3o. Como outras formas neste espectro, as info \u2011\nguerras ser\u00e3o largamente n\u00e3o militares, mas poder\u00e3o ter dimens\u00f5es que se justap\u00f5em \u00e0 \nguerra militar\u00bb6.\numa vez clarificado este conceito afim, John arquilla e David ronfeldt procuraram \ndefinir o conceito de ciberguerra propriamente dito. Na sua \u00f3tica, este \n\u00abrefere\u2011se a conduzir e preparar para conduzir opera\u00e7\u00f5es militares de acordo com os \nprinc\u00edpios da informa\u00e7\u00e3o. Significa interromper, se n\u00e3o mesmo destruir, os sistemas de \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o e de comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, definidos de forma ampla, de modo a incluir at\u00e9 a cultura \nmilitar, nos quais um advers\u00e1rio se apoia para se \u201cconhecer\u201d a si pr\u00f3prio: quem \u00e9, onde \nest\u00e1, o que pode fazer quando, porque est\u00e1 a lutar, que amea\u00e7as contrariar primeiro, etc. \nSignifica tentar saber tudo sobre um advers\u00e1rio, enquanto que se evita que este saiba \nmuito sobre n\u00f3s pr\u00f3prios. Significa modificar a \u201cbalan\u00e7a de informa\u00e7\u00e3o e conhecimento\u201d \na nosso favor, especialmente se a balan\u00e7a de for\u00e7as n\u00e3o \u00e9 favor\u00e1vel.

Da\u00ed que arquilla e ronfeldt tenham sido tam \u2011\nb\u00e9m bastante cautelosos na sua formula\u00e7\u00e3o prospetiva. No seu texto original estes \nfaziam notar que \u00abcomo inova\u00e7\u00e3o na forma de fazer a guerra, antecipamos que a \nciberguerra pode ser para o s\u00e9culo xxi o que a blitzkrieg foi para o s\u00e9culo xx. Mas, \npor agora, tamb\u00e9m acreditamos que o conceito \u00e9 demasiado especulativo para uma \ndefini\u00e7\u00e3o precisa\u00bb11.\no conceito de ciberguerra, tal com definido por arquilla e ronfeldt, tornou\u2011se influente \npelo prest\u00edgio dos autores e da rand Corporation \u00e0 qual est\u00e3o ligados, bem como \npelo seu car\u00e1ter pioneiro e \u00abfuturista\u00bb. tal como ocorreu frequentemente no s\u00e9culo xx, \ncom muitas inova\u00e7\u00f5es em diferentes dom\u00ednios, projetou\u2011se rapidamente para fora \ndos estados unidos. Neste caso, naturalmente que interessou, em primeira linha, os \nmeios estrat\u00e9gicos e militares de diferentes pa\u00edses. No universo lus\u00f3fono encontramos, \ndesde logo, essa influ\u00eancia de maneira evidente num estado \u2013 o Brasil \u2013, o qual tem \nsido crescentemente apontado como uma das principais pot\u00eancias em ascens\u00e3o neste \nin\u00edcio de s\u00e9culo xxi. fazendo eco destas ideias, f. G. Sampaio, num paper elaborado \npara a escola Superior de Geopol\u00edtica e estrat\u00e9gia, referiu\u2011se ao conceito de ciber \u2011\nguerra em termos bastante similares12. Segundo este, a \u00abciberguerra\u00bb derivaria do \nconceito estrat\u00e9gico\u2011militar germ\u00e2nico de leintenkrieg13, o qual data dos tempos da \nii Guerra Mundial. Na sua formula\u00e7\u00e3o atual, visaria \u00aba paralisa\u00e7\u00e3o de um advers\u00e1rio\u00bb, \no qual poder\u00e1 ser um pa\u00eds, um bloco econ\u00f3mico, ou uma alian\u00e7a militar, \u00abpela pene \u2011\ntra\u00e7\u00e3o das redes de computadores que regem as atividades vitais da economia, criando \no caos e difundindo um estado de medo generalizado\u00bb14. acrescenta ainda que \u00abtal \nquadro permite o enfraquecimento das defesas convencionais, podendo\u2011se, ent\u00e3o, \nrela\u00e7\u00f5eS iNterNaCioNaiS  mar\u00e7o : 2012   33 058por t\u00e9cnicas de infiltra\u00e7\u00e3o, atacar o pa\u00eds, bloco ou alian\u00e7a, por meio de a\u00e7\u00f5es terro \u2011\nristas, boatos (difundidos por agentes infiltrados), not\u00edcias falsas veiculadas pelos \nmeios de informa\u00e7\u00e3o de massa\u00bb15. estas a\u00e7\u00f5es permitiriam destruir \u00aba coes\u00e3o, a capa \u2011\ncidade de resist\u00eancia e levariam a um colapso total, que seria a paralisa\u00e7\u00e3o estrat\u00e9gica, \nelevada, por\u00e9m, a um potencial muito maior do que o previsto at\u00e9 hoje\u00bb16.

Para o mesmo autor, os protagonistas t\u00edpicos da ciberguerra seriam os \nhackers20 e os computadores usados por estes. \nMas h\u00e1 outros desenvolvimentos mais recentes relevantes. Nos \u00faltimos anos, sobretudo \ndesde os conflitos da est\u00f3nia (2007) e da Ge\u00f3rgia (2008) com a r\u00fassia, tem\u2011se assistido \na um crescente interesse por este assunto e a uma maior sofistica\u00e7\u00e3o das abordagens \nte\u00f3ricas. Verificamos, tamb\u00e9m, que t\u00eam surgido crescentemente an\u00e1lises mais apro \u2011\nfundadas e apuradas, quer da parte dos meios militares e de seguran\u00e7a, quer de orga \u2011\nniza\u00e7\u00f5es internacionais, de think tanks  e de acad\u00e9micos ou de outros interessados. Por \nexemplo, para o institute for advanced Study of information Warfare dos estados \nunidos, a ciberguerra define\u2011se como \n\u00abo uso ofensivo e defensivo da informa\u00e7\u00e3o e dos sistemas de informa\u00e7\u00e3o para negar, \nexplorar, corromper, ou destruir a informa\u00e7\u00e3o de um advers\u00e1rio, processos baseados na \ninforma\u00e7\u00e3o, sistemas de informa\u00e7\u00e3o e redes baseadas em computadores, enquanto se \nprotegem as pr\u00f3prias. tais a\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o projetadas para atingir vantagens sobre advers\u00e1rios \nmilitares\u00bb21.\nA ciberguerra como nova dimens\u00e3o dos conflitos do s\u00e9culo xxi    Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes  059recentemente, Peter Sommer e ian Brown, num relat\u00f3rio elaborado para a organiza \u2011\n\u00e7\u00e3o para a Coopera\u00e7\u00e3o e o Desenvolvimento econ\u00f3mico ( ocde ) no \u00e2mbito do projeto \n\u00abChoques Globais no futuro\u00bb intitulado \u00abreduzindo o risco Sist\u00e9mico da Cibersegu \u2011\nran\u00e7a\u00bb, voltaram a analisar esta importante quest\u00e3o concetual. No relat\u00f3rio, come\u00e7a \u2011\nram por notar o problema j\u00e1 aqui referido, o qual decorre do facto de o termo tender \na ser usado de forma livre, em sentidos bastante vari\u00e1veis e pouco precisos22. Passando \nem revista alguns dos seus usos mais correntes, estes referem que, no \u00e2mbito do \npensamento sobre seguran\u00e7a e estrat\u00e9gia, \u00e9 frequente encontrarmos o termo utilizado \nno sentido de \u00abuma guerra conduzida substancialmente no ciberespa\u00e7o ou no dom\u00ednio \nvirtual\u00bb23. aqueles que partilham de tal conce\u00e7\u00e3o \u00abt\u00eam frequentemente em mente que \nas ciberguerras tendem a ser muito similares \u00e0s guerras convencionais\u00bb24 pelo que \nid\u00eanticas doutrinas de retalia\u00e7\u00e3o ou dissuas\u00e3o poder\u00e3o ser aplicadas. todavia, Sommer \ne Brown consideram que \u00e9 mais f\u00e1cil definir \u00abciberguerra\u00bb, se os crit\u00e9rios aplic\u00e1veis \nao conceito forem os mesmos que s\u00e3o utilizados para qualquer guerra convencional \nou \u00abcin\u00e9tica\u00bb. Desde logo, para a qualifica\u00e7\u00e3o de uma ocorr\u00eancia como guerra \u2013 e, por \nisso, tamb\u00e9m de ciberguerra \u2013, ser\u00e1 fundamental ter em conta as disposi\u00e7\u00f5es contidas \nem alguns tratados internacionais, nomeadamente as conven\u00e7\u00f5es de haia de 1899 e \n190725, a Carta das Na\u00e7\u00f5es unidas de 1945, a Conven\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es unidas de 1948 \nsobre o genoc\u00eddio e a Conven\u00e7\u00e3o das Na\u00e7\u00f5es unidas de 1980 sobre armas convencio \u2011\nnais excessivamente lesivas (ou cujos efeitos s\u00e3o indiscriminados) \u2013 ou seja, o norma \u2011\ntivo que integra o direito dos conflitos armados/direito internacional humanit\u00e1rio26. \nassim, defendem estes, na sua ess\u00eancia, para se decidir se um ato deve, ou n\u00e3o, ser \nqualificado como ciberguerra, dever\u00e1 submeter\u2011se ao teste de verificar se pode ser \nconsiderado \u00abequivalente\u00bb a um ataque convencional no seu objetivo, intensidade e \ndura\u00e7\u00e3o. e, acrescentam Sommer e Brown, \u00abh\u00e1 tamb\u00e9m uma distin\u00e7\u00e3o a fazer entre \natos que procuram atingir alvos militares e atos destinados a alvos civis\u00bb27. estes fazem \nnotar que a \n\u00abCarta das Na\u00e7\u00f5es unidas requer uma justifica\u00e7\u00e3o para a ado\u00e7\u00e3o de contramedidas por \naqueles que afirmam ter sido atacados. No essencial, a v\u00edtima deve ser capaz de produzir \nprovas fidedignas sobre quem a atacou (algo nem sempre f\u00e1cil no cibermundo) e sobre \nos efeitos dos ataques. o objetivo das contramedidas dever\u00e1 ser for\u00e7ar o estado atacante \na acatar as suas obriga\u00e7\u00f5es nos termos da Carta das Na\u00e7\u00f5es unidas. todavia, como estes \nreferem, entendido desta maneira o conceito apenas poder\u00e1, por princ\u00edpio, aplicar\u2011se aos \nestados e n\u00e3o a atores n\u00e3o estaduais. face a estas dificuldades de defini\u00e7\u00e3o dos contornos \ne da abrang\u00eancia do conceito, pode\u2011se argumentar que o foco da an\u00e1lise da ciberguerra \ndeveria antes deslocar\u2011se para a avalia\u00e7\u00e3o das capacidades das v\u00e1rias formas de (ciber)\narmamento. Nessa hip\u00f3tese, a primeira preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o deveria ser ent\u00e3o tentar encontrar \nas raz\u00f5es pelas quais algu\u00e9m pode querer fazer a guerra, ou iniciar uma atividade hostil \nem grau menor do que uma guerra em larga escala. tipicamente, s\u00e3o disputas sobre o \nrela\u00e7\u00f5eS iNterNaCioNaiS  mar\u00e7o : 2012   33 060territ\u00f3rio, disputas para afirmar a hegemonia, disputas sobre o acesso a recursos e a \nmat\u00e9rias\u2011primas, disputas sobre a religi\u00e3o ou disputas hist\u00f3ricas e vingan\u00e7a\u00bb28 \nque levam ao conflito e \u00e0 guerra. uma vez que \u00abestas hostilidades existem no mundo \nreal, parece haver pouca raz\u00e3o para os estados se limitarem ao armamento \u201ccin\u00e9tico\u201d\u00bb29. \no (ciber)armamento apenas fornece \u00abmeios adicionais atrav\u00e9s dos quais a hostilidade \npode ser prosseguida\u00bb. \nCAPACIDADES \tE\tVULnERAbILIDADES \tOFEnSIVAS\t\nE\tDEFEnSIVAS\tDOS\tATORES\tESTADUAIS\nQuando se analisa a ciberguerra num plano estrat\u00e9gico, inevitavelmente nos ocorre \nefetuar um levantamento das capacidades ofensivas e defensivas dos diversos atores \nque se podem confrontar num hipot\u00e9tico cen\u00e1rio de conflito. em termos modernos, \nquando pensamos a guerra pensamos, por iner\u00eancia, nos estados. esta tradi\u00e7\u00e3o de \nconsiderar o estado soberano (vestefaliano) como ator central das rela\u00e7\u00f5es internacio \u2011\nnais tem um profundo enraizamento hist\u00f3rico. a sua principal refer\u00eancia diplom\u00e1tica \ns\u00e3o os tratados de Vestef\u00e1lia (1648), que puseram fim \u00e0 Guerra dos trinta anos, na \neuropa do s\u00e9culo xvii . Marcaram a ascens\u00e3o progressiva do estado soberano a forma \nprimordial de organiza\u00e7\u00e3o pol\u00edtica das comunidades humanas, primeiro na europa, \ndepois, por todo o mundo. isto sobretudo por influ\u00eancia europeia ao longo do s\u00e9culo \nxix e primeira metade do s\u00e9culo xx. todavia, no mundo atual, como j\u00e1 referimos, a \nprimazia dos estados vestefalianos sofre a competi\u00e7\u00e3o de outros atores, com maior ou \nmenor peso ( oig , ong , empresas transnacionais, grupos subestaduais, etc.). No caso \nda ciberguerra, a quest\u00e3o da relev\u00e2ncia dos atores n\u00e3o estaduais levanta\u2011se com especial \nacuidade. os exemplos dos ciberataques mais conhecidos \u2013 est\u00f3nia (2007) e Ge\u00f3rgia \n(2008), ao qual se poder\u00e1 juntar o caso do ataque do v\u00edrus Stuxnet  (2010), \u00e0s instala\u00e7\u00f5es \nnucleares do ir\u00e3o \u2013, podem ser vistos como uma esp\u00e9cie de \u00abguerras por procura\u00e7\u00e3o\u00bb. \nDe facto, o ponto comum \u00e9 que ocorreram ciberataques contra esses estados, mas, \noficialmente, n\u00e3o t\u00eam qualquer autoria de outros estados. aparentemente, a responsa \u2011\nbilidade caberia apenas a elementos da \u00absociedade civil\u00bb: netizens30 (\u00abcibercidad\u00e3os\u00bb), \nativistas ou \u00ab hackers  patri\u00f3ticos\u00bb. estes, teoricamente, atuariam de motu pr\u00f3prio, \u00e0 mar \u2011\ngem e sem qualquer conhecimento dos estados dos quais s\u00e3o cidad\u00e3os. Vamos deixar \nesta quest\u00e3o para uma an\u00e1lise pr\u00f3pria a efetuar mais \u00e0 frente e, para j\u00e1, concentrarmo\u2011nos \napenas nos atores estaduais.\numa an\u00e1lise das capacidades e vulnerabilidades das principais pot\u00eancias militares \nmundiais foi efetuada recentemente por richard Clarke e robert Knake nos estados \nunidos. estes colocaram uma especial \u00eanfase no aspeto das capacidades defensivas e \ndas vulnerabilidades, por considerarem que estas facetas estavam a ser subavaliadas \npelos meios governamentais de seguran\u00e7a norte\u2011americanos. Na sua abordagem, apre \u2011\nsentaram uma estimativa das capacidades de ciberguerra dos estados unidos, bem \nA ciberguerra como nova dimens\u00e3o dos conflitos do s\u00e9culo xxi    Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes  061como de alguns do seus principais competidores ou inimigos. Segundo richard Clarke \ne robert Knake, qualquer avalia\u00e7\u00e3o (ainda que estimativa) dessas capacidades deve ter \nem conta tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es: i) a capacidade ciberofensiva, entendida como a capacidade \nde efetuar ciberataques a outros estados; ii) a capacidade ciberdefensiva configurada \ncomo \u00aba medida da capacidade de adotar a\u00e7\u00f5es sob um ataque\u00bb, a\u00e7\u00f5es essas que \u00abir\u00e3o \nbloquear ou mitigar esse ataque\u00bb; iii) a ciberdepend\u00eancia medida como \u00aba extens\u00e3o em \nque um estado est\u00e1 ligado e assente sobre redes e sistemas que podem ser vulner\u00e1veis \nno caso de um ciberataque\u00bb31. adotando estas tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es chegar\u00edamos a um qua \u2011\ndro estimativo dessas capacidades, como o que se apresenta em baixo.  \nQuadro 2  >  Estimativa de capacidades globais de ciberguerra de alguns estados32\nEstados Capacidade \nciberofensivaCiberdepend\u00eancia Capacidade\nciberdefensivaScore  total\neua 8 2 1 11\nr\u00fassia  7 5 4 16\nchina 5 4 6 15\nir\u00e3o 4 5 3 12\ncoreia  do norte2 9 7 18\numa quest\u00e3o relevante \u00e9 a de saber, em concreto, quais os dados que os autores usaram \npara chegarem aos scores  que apresentam em cada uma destas tr\u00eas dimens\u00f5es. estes \nreferem apenas que as pontua\u00e7\u00f5es atribu\u00eddas a cada uma destas dimens\u00f5es e estados \nse baseiam numa \u00abavalia\u00e7\u00e3o pessoal\u00bb33. o reparo \u00f3bvio \u00e9 que remetendo os dados ape \u2011\nnas para uma perce\u00e7\u00e3o subjetiva, n\u00e3o s\u00e3o verific\u00e1veis, nem compar\u00e1veis com outros, o \nque, naturalmente, lhes retira valor num uso estritamente cient\u00edfico.

J\u00e1 os estados unidos n\u00e3o t\u00eam a mesma possibilidade. \nPor sua vez, a Coreia do Norte tem um score  elevado, quer para ciberdefesa, quer para \na ciberdepend\u00eancia. isto porque o pa\u00eds \n\u00abpode desligar a sua limitada conex\u00e3o ao ciberespa\u00e7o ainda de forma mais f\u00e1cil e efetiva \ndo que a China. Para al\u00e9m disso, a Coreia do Norte tem t\u00e3o poucos sistemas dependen \u2011\ntes do ciberespa\u00e7o que um grande ciberataque \u00e0 Coreia do Norte praticamente n\u00e3o pro \u2011\nrela\u00e7\u00f5eS iNterNaCioNaiS  mar\u00e7o : 2012   33 062vocaria danos. importa lembrar que a ciberdefesa n\u00e3o se refere ao n\u00famero de habita\u00e7\u00f5es \ncom banda larga, ou ao n\u00famero de smart phones  (telem\u00f3veis \u201cinteligentes\u201d) per capita ; \nrefere\u2011se \u00e0 extens\u00e3o em que infraestruturas cr\u00edticas (rede el\u00e9trica, caminhos de ferro, \ngasodutos, cadeias de abastecimento, etc.), est\u00e3o dependentes de sistemas em rede e n\u00e3o \nt\u00eam um backup efetivo\u00bb35.\nO\tPAPEL\tDOS\tATORES\tn\u00c3O\tESTADUAIS\t\nnOS\tCIbERCOnFLITOS\nNum recente artigo publicado na revista  Survival  do international institute of Strategic \nStudies ( iiss ) de londres, alexander Klimburg analisa a relev\u00e2ncia dos atores n\u00e3o \nestaduais nos ciberconflitos36. o artigo incide especialmente nas situa\u00e7\u00f5es em que estes \ns\u00e3o mobilizados e coordenados por estados, ainda que de forma n\u00e3o oficialmente \nassumida por estes. Klimburg come\u00e7a por fazer notar os pontos de contacto que exis \u2011\ntem, nomeadamente quanto \u00e0 base tecnol\u00f3gica e ferramentas usadas, entre o cibercrime, \no ciberterrorismo e os atos de ciberguerra: \n\u00abCibercrime, ciberterrorismo e ciberguerra partilham uma base tecnol\u00f3gica comum, \nferramentas, log\u00edstica e instrumentos. Podem tamb\u00e9m partilhar as mesmas redes sociais \ne ter objetivos similares. as diferen\u00e7as entre estas duas categorias de ciberatividades s\u00e3o \nfrequentemente t\u00e9nues, ou est\u00e3o apenas nos olhos de quem as v\u00ea. Na perspetiva de um \nciberguerreiro, o cibercrime pode oferecer uma base t\u00e9cnica (ferramentas de software  e \napoio log\u00edstico) e o ciberterrorismo a base social (redes pessoais e motiva\u00e7\u00e3o) com as \nquais podem ser executados ataques \u00e0s redes de computadores de grupos inimigos ou \nna\u00e7\u00f5es.\u00bb37\nassim, certos estados teriam interesse em manter, ou tolerar, aquilo que este designa \ncomo \u00aborganiza\u00e7\u00f5es por procura\u00e7\u00e3o\u00bb. estas poderiam, quando oportuno, ser envolvidas \nem atividades de ciberataques (eventualmente, tamb\u00e9m, em atividades de ciberdefesa). \nPor exemplo, um ataque distribu\u00eddo de nega\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7o poder\u00e1 ser posto em pr\u00e1tica \npor um utilizador m\u00e9dio de computadores, desde que disponha das ferramentas certas. \nPara os estados, uma vantagem, desde logo, \u00e9 que os ataques de nega\u00e7\u00e3o de servi\u00e7o \ns\u00e3o, normalmente, mais dif\u00edceis de imputa\u00e7\u00e3o de autoria do que os ataques de explo \u2011\nra\u00e7\u00e3o da rede (tipicamente espionagem e roubo de informa\u00e7\u00e3o sens\u00edvel). Nestes \u00faltimos, \na informa\u00e7\u00e3o tem de viajar na rede at\u00e9 ao perpetrador, o que normalmente deixa rasto, \ne, tendencialmente, permite imputar a autoria38. Podendo ser o roubo de informa\u00e7\u00e3o, \nem si mesmo, j\u00e1 bastante problem\u00e1tico, quer para a seguran\u00e7a nacional, quer para as \nempresas (consoante o que estiver em causa), este pode n\u00e3o ser ainda o pior problema. \nKlimburg chama a aten\u00e7\u00e3o para o facto de um ataque de explora\u00e7\u00e3o da rede, com o \nobjetivo de espionagem e/ou roubo de informa\u00e7\u00e3o ser, ao mesmo tempo, a base (t\u00e9cnica) \nA ciberguerra como nova dimens\u00e3o dos conflitos do s\u00e9culo xxi    Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes  063para um dos \u00abmais perigosos tipos de ciberataques: a coloca\u00e7\u00e3o, sem conhecimento, \nde \u201cbombas l\u00f3gicas\u201d escondidas\u00bb. trata\u2011se de \u00abficheiros ou de pacotes de software \nrelativamente pequenos, escondidos, que, como n\u00e3o necessitam de comunicar, s\u00e3o \nextremamente dif\u00edceis de localizar. uma vez acionadas as \u201cbombas l\u00f3gicas\u201d podem ser \nmassivamente destrutivas\u00bb39. Klimburg refere, como exemplo deste risco, o caso de um \nengenheiro de software  indiano contratado pelo fannie Mae \u2013 uma das institui\u00e7\u00f5es \nligadas ao cr\u00e9dito hipotec\u00e1rio que esteve na origem do desencadear da crise financeira \nde 2008 nos estados unidos. este, em lit\u00edgio com a empresa, colocou uma \u00abbomba \nl\u00f3gica\u00bb na sua rede, a qual n\u00e3o chegou a ser acionada \u2013 por sorte, a programa\u00e7\u00e3o da \nbomba l\u00f3gica era defeituosa... \u2013, mas poderia ter levado \u00e0 paralisa\u00e7\u00e3o, total ou parcial, \ndo fannie Mae durante uma semana, entre outros danos mais graves, como apagar \ntoda a informa\u00e7\u00e3o da empresa40. \nalgumas interroga\u00e7\u00f5es importantes colocam\u2011se inevitavelmente aqui em mat\u00e9ria de \nimputa\u00e7\u00e3o de responsabilidades: tendo em conta os meios t\u00e9cnicos necess\u00e1rios, que \ntipo de ciberataques \u00e9 plaus\u00edvel que possam ocorrer por iniciativa de atores n\u00e3o esta \u2011\nduais e \u00e0 margem dos estados? e, por similares raz\u00f5es t\u00e9cnicas, log\u00edsticas, de meios, \netc., que tipo de ciberataques \u00e9 plaus\u00edvel que s\u00f3 possam ocorrer com o apoio ou a \nanu\u00eancia t\u00e1cita dos estados, ainda que oficialmente estes neguem qualquer envolvi \u2011\nmento? De acordo com Klimburg, ataques menos sofisticados do que a coloca\u00e7\u00e3o de \n\u00abbombas l\u00f3gicas\u00bb mas mais vis\u00edveis do que estas, \u00abcomo os ataques de nega\u00e7\u00e3o de \nservi\u00e7o ou os ataques que apagam p\u00e1ginas de um s\u00edtio na web41 s\u00e3o empreendidos por \ngrupos n\u00e3o estaduais atuando, pelo menos, com o seu suporte t\u00e1cito\u00bb42. Note\u2011se que \nKlimburg faz esta afirma\u00e7\u00e3o tendo em mente os casos concretos da r\u00fassia e da China \ne ocorr\u00eancias como as que tiveram lugar na est\u00f3nia em 2007 e na Ge\u00f3rgia em 2008. \ntodavia, em teoria, estes at\u00e9 poder\u00e3o ocorrer apenas por motu  pr\u00f3prio de atores n\u00e3o \nestaduais, dado o tipo de tecnologia, conhecimentos e recursos necess\u00e1rios estarem \nacess\u00edveis a estes. J\u00e1 a situa\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 diferente se considerarmos os ataques de explora\u00e7\u00e3o \nda rede, sobretudo nos casos mais sofisticados.

Parecem existir duas grandes \nexplica\u00e7\u00f5es. uma primeira sugere a proximidade com os servi\u00e7os de informa\u00e7\u00f5es e \nseguran\u00e7a russos, que lhe permitiriam um \u00abtratamento especial\u00bb. uma outra raz\u00e3o \navan\u00e7ada prende\u2011se com a maneira de encarar este tipo de atividades na sociedade russa. \numa parte significativa da popula\u00e7\u00e3o v\u00ea isso n\u00e3o como problem\u00e1tico para o pa\u00eds, mas \nantes para os pa\u00edses ocidentais \u2013 o alvo preferencial dessas atividades. isto leva a que \nestes atos sejam vistos como uma esp\u00e9cie de \u00abmaus modos de cavalheiros\u00bb, ou at\u00e9 em \ntermos quase heroicos49. tal como vimos no caso do \u00abpatroc\u00ednio\u00bb de atores n\u00e3o esta \u2011\nduais pela China \u2013 fen\u00f3meno que, naturalmente, n\u00e3o \u00e9 exclusivo desse pa\u00eds, nem da \nr\u00fassia.... \u2013, os servi\u00e7os secretos e de seguran\u00e7a procuram mobilizar \u00ab hackers  patri\u00f3ticos\u00bb \nque possam ser usados em ciberataques sem envolver diretamente, pelo menos na \napar\u00eancia, o estado russo.\nMas ser\u00e3o estes usos, question\u00e1veis do ponto de vista \u00e9tico e legal, de atores n\u00e3o \ngovernamentais ou que supostamente t\u00eam esse perfil, um exclusivo de estados onde  \nexistem regimes autorit\u00e1rios ou semidemocr\u00e1ticos?

Como faz notar Klimburg, \u00abas empresas priva \u2011\ndas envolvidas diretamente em trabalhos de seguran\u00e7a e defesa podem estar t\u00e3o \nestreitamente entrela\u00e7adas com o estado que, vistas do exterior, dificilmente se des \u2011\ncortina qualquer distin\u00e7\u00e3o clara entre ambos\u00bb50. Para al\u00e9m disso, a forma mais rele \u2011\nvante de mobiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de atores n\u00e3o estaduais passa pela identifica\u00e7\u00e3o destes com os \nobjetivos dos governos.

Como explicam Brian Cashell et al.  \n\u00abos custos associados aos ciberataques podem ser divididos em diretos e indiretos. os \ncustos diretos incluem as despesas relacionadas com a restaura\u00e7\u00e3o do sistema original \ndo computador, anterior ao ataque. a recupera\u00e7\u00e3o de um ataque ir\u00e1, tipicamente, reque \u2011\nA ciberguerra como nova dimens\u00e3o dos conflitos do s\u00e9culo xxi    Jos\u00e9 Pedro Teixeira Fernandes  067rer despesas extras em trabalho e materiais, sendo estes os custos mais f\u00e1ceis de medir. \nMas, mesmo a este n\u00edvel b\u00e1sico de contabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de custos, podem surgir complexidades. \nSe um ataque levar ao aumento das despesas em tecnologias de informa\u00e7\u00e3o ser\u00e3o esses \ncustos atribu\u00edveis ao ataque? e se um upgrade  no hardware  ou no software  for acelerado por \num ataque, deve esse upgrade ser considerado como um custo de seguran\u00e7a? um outro \nconjunto de custos indiretos deriva da interrup\u00e7\u00e3o dos neg\u00f3cios o que, numa linguagem \nmais jur\u00eddica, poder\u00edamos designar como \u201clucros cessantes\u201d. estes custos podem incluir \nperda de receita e perda de produtividade dos trabalhadores durante a interrup\u00e7\u00e3o. recei \u2011\ntas perdidas podem facilmente ser medidas por refer\u00eancia a um per\u00edodo pr\u00e9\u2011ataque, mas \nisto pode n\u00e3o resolver toda a quest\u00e3o. as receitas perdidas podem ser um fen\u00f3meno \ntransit\u00f3rio, limitado ao per\u00edodo do ataque (e, possivelmente, tamb\u00e9m a um per\u00edodo \nposterior), ou podem ser de longo prazo, se, por exemplo, alguns mudarem permanen \u2011\ntemente para empresas competidoras\u00bb56. \nMas, para al\u00e9m das consequ\u00eancias ao n\u00edvel microecon\u00f3mico e empresarial, e da (j\u00e1 \ndif\u00edcil) avalia\u00e7\u00e3o e quantifica\u00e7\u00e3o desses danos, a quest\u00e3o das consequ\u00eancias de um \nciberataque coloca\u2011se, tamb\u00e9m, a n\u00edvel macroecon\u00f3mico, aumentando a dificuldade \nde avalia\u00e7\u00e3o. Neste contexto, Brian Cashell et al.  fazem notar que \u00abqualquer estimativa \ndo potencial custo econ\u00f3mico de um ciberataque ser\u00e1, em \u00faltima inst\u00e2ncia, especu \u2011\nlativa\u00bb.  Se imaginarmos um cen\u00e1rio em que toda a atividade econ\u00f3mica \u00e9 \u00abtempo \u2011\nrariamente interrompida por um ciberataque, a \u00fanica considera\u00e7\u00e3o na estimativa dos \ncustos ser\u00e1 a dura\u00e7\u00e3o do evento. a percentagem do Produto interno Bruto ( pib), \nproduzida num dado dia \u00e9 de cerca de 0,3 por cento do total do ano. alguma da \nprodu\u00e7\u00e3o que poderia ser interrompida \u00e9 improv\u00e1vel que fosse perda permanente. \nSeria simplesmente adiada at\u00e9 que os efeitos do ataque se dissipassem. Desde que \numa consider\u00e1vel, ainda que desconhecida, fatia dos ouptus  n\u00e3o esteja dependente \ndos computadores, o custo final ser\u00e1 menor do que esse. historicamente, a produ\u00e7\u00e3o \ntotal anual de bens e servi\u00e7os tem sido, em m\u00e9dia, cerca de um ter\u00e7o do valor total \nde stock  de capital f\u00edsico. em 2001, o equipamento inform\u00e1tico e o software  contavam \ncerca de 18 por cento do stock total de capital. Se for assumido que o equipamento e \no software  contribuem para o output  da mesma maneira que outras formas de capital, \na sua contribui\u00e7\u00e3o direta ser\u00e1 cerca de 18 por cento da produ\u00e7\u00e3o total anual. Se essa \nfatia do output  fosse interrompida durante um \u00fanico dia, isso representaria cerca de \n0,05 por cento do pib total anual. Desde que um ciberataque n\u00e3o seja abrangente e \nseja de dura\u00e7\u00e3o curta, \u00e9 prov\u00e1vel que quaisquer consequ\u00eancias macroecon\u00f3micas \nsejam relativamente pequenas. Mas, seja qual for o \u00e2mbito do ataque, a capacidade \nde recuperar rapidamente \u00e9 importante, pois a dura\u00e7\u00e3o do per\u00edodo em que os com \u2011\nputadores permanecem afetados \u00e9 uma determinante importante dos custos.

Yang\nUCLAAnton Tsitsulin\nGoogle Research\nAbstract\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has greatly improved the performance of\nLarge Language Model (LLM) responses by grounding generation with context\nfrom existing documents. These systems work well when documents are clearly\nrelevant to a question context. But what about when a document has partial\ninformation, or less obvious connections to the context? And how should we reason\nabout connections between documents? In this work, we seek to answer these two\ncore questions about RAG generation. We introduce G-RAG, a reranker based\non graph neural networks (GNNs) between the retriever and reader in RAG. Our\nmethod combines both connections between documents and semantic information\n(via Abstract Meaning Representation graphs) to provide a context-informed ranker\nfor RAG. G-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while having smaller\ncomputational footprint. Additionally, we assess the performance of PaLM 2 as a\nreranker and find it to significantly underperform G-RAG. This result emphasizes\nthe importance of reranking for RAG even when using Large Language Models.\n1 Introduction\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) [ 35] has brought improvements to many problems in text\ngeneration. One example is Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) [ 40] which involves\nanswering natural language questions without limiting the domain of the answers. RAG merges\nthe retrieval and answering processes, which improves the ability to effectively collect knowledge,\nextract useful information, and generate answers. Even though it is successful in fetching relevant\ndocuments, RAG is not able to utilize connections between documents. In the ODQA setting, this\nleads to the model disregarding documents containing answers, a.k.a. positive documents , with less\napparent connections to the question context. We can identify these documents if we connect them\nwith positive documents whose context is strongly relevant to the question context.\nTo find connections between documents and select highly relevant ones, the reranking process plays\na vital role in further effectively filtering retrieved documents. A robust reranker also benefits the\nreading process by effectively identifying positive documents and elevating them to prominent ranking\npositions. When the reader\u2019s output perfectly matches one of the gold standard answers, it leads\nto an increase in exact-match performance metrics. Given our paper\u2019s emphasis on the reranking\naspect, our performance metrics primarily focus on ranking tasks, specifically Mean Tied Reciprocal\nRanking and MHits@10. Thus, our paper focuses on using reranking to improve RAG \u2013 as it is a\nfundamental bridge between the retrieval and reading processes.\nPre-trained langauge models (LMs) like BERT [ 6], RoBERTa [ 23], and BART [ 19] have been widely\nused to enhance reranking performance by estimating the relevant score between questions and\ndocuments. Recently, the Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graph has been integrated with\na LM to enhance the system\u2019s ability to comprehend complex semantics [ 42]. While the current\nrerankers exhibit admirable performance, certain limitations persist.\nPreprint. Under review.arXiv:2405.18414v1  [cs.CL]  28 May 2024\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n\u2026Q&PAMRs\nfindconnectionsestablishGNNDocumentGraphReranker\n\u2026Figure 1: G-RAG uses two graphs for re-ranking documents: The Abstract Meaning Representation\n(AMR) graph is used as features for the document-level graph. Document graph is then used for\ndocument reranking.\nFirstly, as mentioned above, most of the current works fail to capture important connections between\ndifferent retrieved documents. Some recent work [ 46] tries to incorporate external knowledge graphs\nto improve the performance of the reading process in RAG but at the cost of significant memory\nusage for knowledge graph storage. The connection between documents has not been considered\nin the reranking process yet. Secondly, even though the AMR graph improves the understanding of\nthe complex semantics, state-of-the-art [ 42] work integrates redundant AMR information into the\npre-trained language models. This extra information can cause potential overfitting, in addition to\nincreases of in computational time and GPU cost. Thirdly, current papers utilize common pre-trained\nlanguage models as rerankers which are insufficient given the fast pace of LLM development. With\nthe recent breakthroughs from LLM, researchers are curious about how LLMs without perform\n(without fine-tuning) on the reranking task.\nTo address these challenges and limitations, we propose a method based on document graphs, where\neach node represents a document, and each edge represents that there are common concepts between\ntwo documents. We incorporate the connection information between different documents into the\nedge features and update the edge features through the message-passing mechanism. For node\nfeatures, even though we aim to add AMR information to compose a richer understanding of complex\nsemantics, we won\u2019t overwhelmingly add all AMR-related tokens as node-level features. Instead, we\ninvestigate the determining factor that facilitates the reranker to identify more relevant documents\nand encode this key factor to node features.\nMoreover, instead of using the cross-entropy loss function during the training, we apply pairwise\nranking loss in consideration of the essential aim of ranking. We also investigate the performance\nof a publicly available LLM, i.e., PaLM 2 [ 9] with different versions, as a reranker on an ODQA.\nAccording to the moderate performance of PaLM 2 on reranking tasks, we provide several potential\nreasons and emphasize the irreplaceable role of reranker model design to improve RAG. The frame-\nwork of graph-based reranking in the proposed G-RAG is illustrated in Fig 1.To provide a clearer\nillustration of our method\u2019s pipeline, please refer to Fig 4 in the Appendix.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:\n1.To improve RAG for ODQA, we propose a document-graph-based reranker that leverages\nconnections between different documents. When the documents share similar information\nwith their neighbor nodes, it helps the reranker to successfully identify the documents\ncontaining answer context that is only weakly connected to the question.\n2.We introduce new metrics to assess a wide range of ranking scenarios, including those\nwith tied ranking scores. The metrics effectively evaluate this scenario by diminishing the\noptimistic effect brought by tied rankings. Based on these metrics, our proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art and requires fewer computational resources.\n3.We assess the performance of a publicly available LLM (PaLM 2 [ 9]) as a reranker, exploring\nvariations across different model sizes. We find that excessive ties within the generated\nranking scores hinder the effectiveness of pre-trained large language models in improving\nRAG through reranking.\n2\n2 Related Work\nRAG in ODQA. RAG [ 20,35] combines information retrieval (via Dense Passage Retrieval, DPR\n[16]) and a reading process in a differentiable manner for ODQA. A line of literature focuses on\ndeveloping rerankers for further improving RAG. Approaches like monoT5 [ 30] and monoELECTRA\n[34] use proposed pre-trained models. Moreover, Zhuang et al. [47] propose a fine-tuned T5 version\nas a reranker. More recently, Park et al. [33] develop a reranker module by fine-tuning the reader\u2019s\nneural networks through a prompting method. However, the above approaches neglect to investigate\nthe connections among documents and fail to leverage this information during the reranking process.\nThese methods are prone to fail to identify the documents containing gold answers that may not\nexhibit obvious connections to the question context. To address this issue, our proposed method\nis based on document graphs and is more likely to identify valuable information contained in a\ndocument if most of its neighboring document nodes in the graph share similar information.\nGraphs in ODQA. Knowledge graphs, which represent entities and their relations, have been\nleveraged in ODQA [ 46,15,1,5] to improve the performance of RAG. However, KG-based methods\nrequire large external knowledge bases and entity mapping from documents to the entities in the\nknowledge graph, which would increase the memory cost. Our proposed method does not depend on\nexternal knowledge graphs. While recent work by Wang et al. [42] uses AMR graphs generated from\nquestions and documents to construct embeddings, their focus remains on text-level relations within\nsingle document. In contrast, our approach uniquely leverages document graphs to characterize\ncross-document connections, a novel application within the RAG reranking process.\nAbstract Meaning Representation (AMR). AMR [ 4] serves as a promising tool for representing\ntextual semantics through a rooted, directed graph. In the AMR graph, nodes represent basic semantic\nunits like entities and concepts, while edges denote the connections between them. AMR graphs have\nmore structured semantic information compared to the general form of natural language [ 2,29]. A\nline of literature has integrated AMR graphs into learning models. Recently, Wang et al. [42] have\napplied AMR to ODQA to deal with complex semantic information. Even though the performance\nof the reranker and the reader is improved in [ 42], their method also increases the computational\ntime and GPU memory cost. This issue may arise by integrating all tokens of AMR nodes and edges\nwithout conscientiously selecting the key factors. To address this issue, our method aims to investigate\nthe graph structure of AMR graphs and identify the key factors that improve the performance of the\nreranker.\nLLMs in Reranking. LLMs such as ChatGPT [ 31], PaLM 2 [ 9], LLaMA [ 38], and GPT4 [ 32], have\nproven to be capable of providing answers to a broad range of questions due to their vast knowledge\nrepositories and chain-of-thought reasoning capability. With this breakthrough, researchers are\nseeking to explore potential improvements that LLMs can bring to improve RAG in ODQA, such as\n[12,26]. At the same time, several studies [ 41,37] have scrutinized the efficacy of LLMs in Question-\nAnswering. Wang et al. [41] indicates the superiority of the DPR [ 16] + FiD [ 13] approach over LLM\nin ODQA. While some papers have demonstrated improvements in LLM reranking performance, it\u2019s\nessential to note that these enhancements often involve additional techniques such as augmented query\ngeneration [ 36] or conditional ranking tasks [ 11], which may not directly align with our zero-shot\nsetting. The recent paper [ 28] demonstrates that LLM is a good few-shot reranker and investigates\ndifferent scenarios where zero-shot LLMs perform poorly. It also provides efforts to address these\nchallenges by combining various techniques, such as employing smaller language models. Despite\nthese investigations, the potential of LLMs without fine-tuning as rerankers to improve RAG remains\nunexplored, as existing studies often take pre-trained language models such as BERT [ 6], RoBERTa\n[23], and BART [19] in the reranker role.\n3 Proposed Method: G-RAG\nG-RAG leverages the rich structural and semantic information provided by the AMR graphs to\nenhance document reranking. Section 3.1 details how we use AMR graph information and build a\ngraph structure among the retrieved documents. Section 3.2 outlines the design of our graph neural\nnetwork architecture for reranking documents.\n3\n3.1 Establishing Document Graphs via AMR\nIn ODQA datasets we consider, one document is a text block of 100 words that come from the\ntext corpus. For each question-document pair, we concatenate the question qand document pas\n\u201cquestion:<question text><document text> \u201dand then exploit AMRBART [ 3] to parse the sequence\ninto a singular AMR graph. The AMR graph for question qand document pis denoted as Gqp=\n{V, E}, where VandEare nodes and edges, respectively. Each node is a concept, and each edge\nis denoted as e= (s, r, d )where s, r, d represent the source node, relation, and the destination\nnode, respectively. Our reranker aims to rank among the top 100 documents retrieved by DPR [ 16].\nThus, given one question qand documents {p1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, pn}withn= 100 , we establish the undirected\ndocument graph Gq={V,E}based on AMRs {Gqp1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, Gqpn}. For each node vi\u2208 V, it\ncorresponds to the document pi. For vi, vj\u2208 V,i\u0338=j, if the corresponding AMR GqpiandGqpj\nhave common nodes, there will be an undirected edge between viandvj(with a slight abuse in\nnotation) denoted as eij= (vi, vj)\u2208 E. We remove isolated nodes in Gq. In the following, we will\nconstruct the graph neural networks based on the document graphs to predict whether the document\nis relevant to the question. Please refer to Appendix A for AMR graph statistics, i.e., the number of\nnodes and edges in AMR graphs, of the common datasets in ODQA.\n3.2 Graph Neural Networks for Reranking\nFollowing Section 3.1, we construct a graph among the n= 100 retrieved documents denoted as\nGqgiven the question q. We aim to exploit both the structural information and the AMR semantic\ninformation to rerank the retrieved documents. To integrate the semantic information of documents,\nthe pre-trained language models such as BERT [ 6], and RoBERTa [ 23] are powerful tools to encode\nthe document texts as node features in graph neural networks. Even though Wang et al. [42] integrate\nAMR information into LMs, it increases computational time and GPU memory usage. To address\nthis, we proposed node and edge features for graph neural networks, which simultaneously exploit\nthe structural and the semantic information of AMR but avoid adding redundant information.\n3.2.1 Generating Node Features\nOur framework applies a pre-trained language model to encode all the nretrieved documents in\n{p1, p2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, pn}given a question q. The document embedding is denoted as \u02dcX\u2208Rn\u00d7dwhere dis\nthe hidden dimension, and each row of \u02dcXis given by\n\u02dcxi= Encode( pi)fori\u2208 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n}. (1)\nSince AMR brings more complex and useful semantic information, we intend to concatenate doc-\nument text and corresponding AMR information as the input of the encoder. However, if we\nintegrate all the information into the embedding process as the previous work [ 42] did, it would\nbring high computational costs and may lead to overfitting. To avoid this, we investigate the de-\ntermining factor that facilitates the reranker to identify more relevant documents. By studying the\nstructure of AMRs for different documents, we note that almost every AMR has the node \u201cques-\ntion\u201d, where the word \u201cquestion\" is included in the input of the AMR parsing model, given by\n\u201cquestion:<question text><document text> \u201d. Thus, we can find the single source shortest path start-\ning from the node \u201cquestion\". When listing every path, the potential connection from the question to\nthe answer becomes much clearer. By looking into the nodes covered in each path, both the structural\nand semantic information can be collected. The embedding enables us to utilize that information to\nidentify the similarity between question and document context.\nTo better illustrate the structure of the shortest path, we also conduct some experiments to show the\nstatistic of the shortest path, see Fig 3 in Appendix. We study the shortest single source paths (SSSPs)\nstarting from \u201cquestion\u201d in the AMR graphs of documents from the train set of Natural Question\n(NQ) [ 18] and TriviaQA (TQA)[ 14] dataset. The analysis shows that certain negative documents\ncannot establish adequate connections to the question context within their text. Moreover, negative\ndocuments encounter another extreme scenario where paths contain an abundance of information\nrelated to the question text but lack valuable information such as the gold answers. This unique\npattern provides valuable insight that can be utilized during the encoding process to improve the\nreranker performance.\n4\nThus, the proposed document embedding is given by X\u2208Rn\u00d7dand each row of Xcan be given by,\nfori\u2208 {1,2,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7n}:\nxi= Encode(concat( pi, ai)), (2)\nwhere aiis a sequence of words, representing the AMR information concerning the document pi.\nThere are two steps to get the representation of ai: 1) Path Identification: Firstly, the shortest single\nsource paths (SSSPs) are determined starting from the node labeled \"question\" in the AMR graph\nGqpi. Each path identified should not be a subset of another. For instance, consider the following\npaths composed of node concepts: [\u2018question\u2019, \u2018cross\u2019, \u2018world-region\u2019, \u2018crucifix\u2019, \u2018number\u2019, \u2018be-\nlocated-at\u2019, \u2018country\u2019, \u2018Spain\u2019], [\u2018question\u2019, \u2018cross\u2019, \u2018religion\u2019, \u2018Catholicism\u2019, \u2018belief\u2019, \u2018worship\u2019]; 2)\nNode Concept Extraction: Subsequently, the node concepts along these identified paths are extracted\nto construct ai. In the example provided, aiis formed as follows: \"question cross world-region\ncrucifix number be-located-at country Spain religion Catholicism belief worship\". X\u2208Rn\u00d7d(2)\nwill be the initial node representation of graph neural networks.\n3.2.2 Edge Features\nBesides the node features, we also adequately leverage edge features associated with undirected\nedges in AMR {Gqp1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, Gqpn}. Let \u02c6E\u2208Rn\u00d7n\u00d7ldenote the edge features of the graph. Then,\n\u02c6Eij\u00b7\u2208Rlrepresents the l-dimensional feature vector of the edge between the node viand node vj\ni\u0338=j, and \u02c6Eijkdenotes the k-th dimension of the edge feature in \u02c6Eij\u00b7. In our framework, l= 2and\n\u02c6Eis given by:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\u02c6Eij\u00b7= 0,no connection between GqpiandGqpj,\n\u02c6Eij1=# common nodes between GqpiandGqpj,\n\u02c6Eij2=# common edges between GqpiandGqpj.(3)\nWe then normalize the edge feature \u02c6Eto avoid the explosive scale of output node features when\nbeing multiplied by the edge feature in graph convolution operations. Thus, our derived feature E\nis normalized on the first and second dimension, respectively. Similar edge normalization has also\nbeen considered in the paper [ 8].E\u2208Rn\u00d7n\u00d7lwill be the initial edge representation of graph neural\nnetworks.\n3.2.3 Representation Update\nBased on the above initial node and edge representations, we arrive at updating representations in\nthe graph neural networks. Given a document graph G(V,E)with|V|=n, the input feature of node\nv\u2208 V is denoted as x0\nv\u2208Rd, and the initial representation of the edge between node vanduis given\nbye0\nuv\u2208Rlwithl= 2. LetN(v)denote the neighbor nodes of the node v\u2208 V. The representation\nof node v\u2208 V at layer \u2113can be derived from a GNN model given by:\nx\u2113\nv=g(x\u2113\u22121\nv,[\nu\u2208N(v)f(x\u2113\u22121\nu,e\u2113\u22121\nuv)), (4)\nwhere f,Sandgare functions for computing feature, aggregating data, and updating node repre-\nsentations, respectively. Specifically, the function fapplies different dimensional edge features as\nweights to the node features, given by\nf(x\u2113\u22121\nu,e\u2113\u22121\nuv) =lX\nm=1e\u2113\u22121\nuv(m)x\u2113\u22121\nu. (5)\nWe choose mean aggregator [ 17] as the operationS. The parameterized function gis a non-\nlinear learnable function that aggregates the representation of the node and its neighbor nodes.\nSimultaneously, the representation of edge starting from v\u2208 V at layer \u2113is given by:\ne\u2113\nv\u00b7=g(e\u2113\u22121\nv\u00b7,[\nu\u2208N(v)e\u2113\u22121\nu\u00b7). (6)\n5\n3.2.4 Reranking Score and Training Loss\nGiven a question qand its document graph Gq={V,E}, we have the output node representations of\nGNN, i.e., xL\nv, where Lis the number of GNN layers. With the same encoder in (2), the question qis\nembedded as\ny= Encode( q). (7)\nThe reranking score for each node vi\u2208 V corresponding the document piis calculated by\nsi=y\u22a4xL\nvi, (8)\nfori= 1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, nand|V|=n. The cross-entropy training loss of document ranking for the given\nquestion qis:\nLq=\u2212nX\ni=1yilog \nexp(si)Pn\nj=1exp(sj)!\n(9)\nwhere yi= 1ifpiis the positive document, and 0for the negative document. The cross-entropy loss\nmay fail to deal with the unbalanced data in ODQA where the number of negative documents is much\ngreater than the number of positive documents. Besides the cross-entropy loss function, the pairwise\nloss function has been a powerful tool for ranking [ 21]. Given a pair of scores siandsj, the ranking\nloss is given by :\nRLq(si, sj, r) = max (0 ,\u2212r(si\u2212sj) + 1) , (10)\nwhere r= 1if document ishould be ranked higher than document j, and vice-versa for r=\u22121. We\nconduct experiments based on both loss functions and emphasize the advantage of the ranking loss\n(10) over the cross-entropy loss (9).\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Setting\nDatasets. We conduct experiments on two representative ODQA datasets Natural Ques-\ntions (NQ) [ 18] and and TriviaQA (TQA) [ 14]. NQ is derived from Google Search Queries and TQA\nincludes questions from trivia and quiz-league websites. Detailed dataset statistics are presented\nin Table 4 in Appendix A. Note that the gold answer lists in dataset NQ usually have much fewer\nelements than the dataset TQA, which leads to a much smaller number of positive documents for\neach question.\nWe use DPR [ 16] to retrieve 100documents for each question and generate the AMR graph for each\nquestion-document pair using AMRBART [ 3]. The dataset with AMR graphs is provided by [ 42]1.\nPlease refer to Appendix A for more details on the AMR statistic information. We conducted our\nexperiments on a Tesla A100 40GB GPU, demonstrating the low computational needs of G-RAG.\nModel Details. For the GNN-based reranking models, we adopt a 2-layer Graph Convolutional\nNetwork [ 17] with hidden dimension chosen from {8,64,128}via hyperparameter-tuning. The\ndropout rate is chosen from {0.1,0.2,0.4}. We initialize the GNN node features using pre-trained\nmodels, e.g, BERT [ 6], GTE [ 22], BGE [ 44], Ember [ 24]. We base our implementaion of the\nembedding model on the HuggingFace Transformers library [ 43]. For training our framework, we\nadopt the optimizer AdamW [ 25] with the learning rate chosen from {5e\u22125,1e\u22124,5e\u22124}. Batch\nsize is set to 5. We set the learning rate warm-up with 1,000steps. The number of total training steps\nis50k, and the model is evaluated every 10k steps.\n4.1.1 Metrics\nEven though Top-K accuracy, where the ground-truth ranking is based on DPR scores [ 16], is com-\nmonly used in the measurement of reranking [ 7,13], this metric is unsuitable for indicating the overall\nreranking performance for all positive documents. Moreover, with the promising development of LLM\n1https://github.com/wangcunxiang/Graph-aS-Tokens/tree/main\n6\nin learning the relevance between texts, DPR scores may lose their advantage and fairness. To address\nthis issue, other metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Mean Hits@10 (MHits@10)\nare used for measuring the reranking performance [ 42]. To be specific, The Mean Reciprocal Rank\n(MRR) score of positive document is given by MRR =1\n|Q|P\nq\u2208Q(1\n|P+|P\np\u2208P+1\nrp),whereQis the\nquestion set from the evaluating dataset, P+is the set of positive documents, and rpis the rank of\ndocument pestimated by the reranker. The MHits@10 indicates the percentage of positive documents\nthat are ranked in the Top 10, given by MHits@10 =1\n|Q|P\nq\u2208Q(1\n|P+|P\np\u2208P+I(rp<= 10)) ,where\nthe indication I(A) = 0 if the event Ais true, otherwise 0.\nThe above metrics work well for most cases, however, they may fail to fairly characterize the ranking\nperformance when there are ties in ranking scores, which is common in relevant scores generated by\nLLMs such as ChatGPT [ 31], PaLM 2 [ 9], LLaMA [ 38], and GPT4 [ 32]. Please refer to Fig 5 in the\nAppendix for the detailed prompt and results of relevant scores between questions and documents.\nTo address ties in the ranking scores, we propose variants of MRR and MHits@10. Denote r(t)\npas the\nrank of the document pwithtties. In other words, the relevant score between the question and the\ndocument pis the same as other t\u22121documents. The variant of MRR for tied ranking is named\nMean Tied Reciprocal Ranking (MTRR), represented as\nMTRR =1\n|Q|X\nq\u2208Q\u00121\n|P+|X\np\u2208P+1\nr(t)\npI(t= 1)\n+2\nr(t)\np+r(t)\np+t\u22121I(t >1)\u0013\n. (11)\nThe metric MTRR addresses the tied rank r(t)\npestimated by the reranker via averaging the optimistic\nrankr(t)\npand the pessimistic rank r(t)\np+t\u22121. The metrics MRR and MTRR are the same when there\nis no ranking tie. The variant of MHits@10 for tied ranking is Tied Mean Hits@10 (TMHit@10).\nDenote H(p)as the set that includes all the ranks {r(ti)\npi}that are higher than the rank of document p,\ni.e.,r(\u03c4)\np. Based on these notations, we present the new metric as:\nTMHits@10 =1\n|Q|X\nq\u2208Q\uf8eb\n\uf8ed1\n|P+|X\np\u2208P+Hits@10( p)\uf8f6\n\uf8f8, (12)\nwhere Hits@10( p)is defined as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f4\uf8f30,ifP\niti>10for\u2200r(ti)\npi\u2208 H(p),\n(10\u2212P\niti)/\u03c4,if0<P\niti<10\nfor\u2200r(ti)\npi\u2208 H(p)and\u03c4 >1,\n10/\u03c4,ifH(p) =\u2205and\u03c4 >10,\n1,otherwise .\nIf there are ties in the Top-10 ranking, the metric TMHit@10 diminishing the optimistic effect via\ndividing the hit-number (no greater than 10) by the number of ties.\n4.2 Comparing Reranker Systems\nWe compare our proposed algorithm with baselines as follows with fixed hyper-parameters and no\nfine-tuning, where the hidden dimension is 8, the dropout rate is 0.1, and the learning rate is 1e-4.\nw/o reranker: Without an additional reranker, the ranking score is based on the retrieval scores\nprovided by DPR [ 16].BART: The pre-trained language model BART [ 19] serves as the reranker.\nBART-GST: This method integrates graph-as-token into the pre-trained model [ 42]. For each dataset,\nwe use the best performance provided in the paper. RGCN-S [42] stacks the RGCN model on the\ntop of the transformer. Even though this method is based on graph neural networks, it doesn\u2019t\nrely on the document graphs, but construct nodes in the graph model based on the text alignment\nin question-document pairs. MLP: The initial node features are only based on document text as\ndescribed in (1) with the BERT [ 6] encoder. After the node features go through MLP, we get the\nrelevant scores via (8) and take the cross-entropy function (9) as training loss. GCN: Besides updating\nnode representations via GCN, the rest setting is the same as MLP. We also conduct experiments with\n7\ndifferent GNN models. Please refer to Appendix B for details. G-RAG: The initial node features\nare based on document text and AMR information as described in (2). The rest of the setting is the\nsame as GCN. G-RAG-RL: Using the ranking loss function and keep the other setting the same as\nG-RAG.\nNQ TQA\nstrategy MRR MH MRR MH\nw/o reranker 20.2 18.0 37.9 34.6 12.1 12.3 25.5 25.9\nBART 25.7 23.3 49.3 45.8 16.9 17.0 37.7 38.0\nBART-GST 28.4 25.0 53.2 48.7 17.5 17.6 39.1 39.5\nRGCN-S 26.1 23.1 49.5 46.0 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nMLP 19.2 17.8 40.0 38.8 17.6 17.1 34.0 31.4\nGCN 22.6 22.4 47.6 44.2 18.2 17.4 38.0 37.0\nG-RAG 25.1 24.2 49.1 47.2 18.5 18.3 38.5 39.1\nG-RAG-RL 27.3 25.7 49.2 47.4 19.8 18.3 42.9 39.4\nTable 1: Results on the dev/test set of NQ and TQA without hyperparameter fine-tuning.\nThe results on MRR and MHits@10 on the NQ and TQA datasets are provided in Table 1. Note that\nthe results on NQ always outperform the results on TQA, this is due to a smaller number of positive\ndocuments making it easy to put most of the positive documents into the Top 10. Generally speaking,\nTQA is a more complex and robust dataset than NQ. Models with graph-based approaches, such as\nGCN and G-RAG, show competitive performance across metrics. These methods have advantages\nover the baseline models, i.e., without reranker and MLP. In conclusion, based on the simulation\nresults, the proposed method G-RAG-RL emerges as a strong model, indicating the effectiveness of\ngraph-based strategies and the benefit of pairwise ranking loss on identifying positive documents. To\nhighlight the advantages of the proposed G-RAG over state-of-the-art benchmarks, we conducted\nexperiments across various embedding models with fine-tuning parameter in the next section.\nNQ TQA\nstrategy MRR MH MRR MH\nw/o reranker 20.2 18.0 37.9 34.6 12.1 12.3 25.5 25.9\nBART 25.7 23.3 49.3 45.8 16.9 17.0 37.7 38.0\nPaLM 2 XS 14.9 14.0 34.1 34.2 11.6 12.5 29.1 31.6\nPaLM 2 L 18.6 17.9 40.7 39.7 12.7 12.9 34.7 35.6\nG-RAG-RL 27.3 25.7 49.2 47.4 19.8 18.3 42.9 39.4\nTable 2: Results of PaLM 2 being the reranker. Small embedding models outperform LLMs in this\nsetting. In comparison, G-RAG-RL considerably improves the results compared to both language\nmodel types by leveraging connection information across documents. We use Tied Mean Hits@10.\n4.3 Using different LLMs as Embedding Models\nThe feature encoder always plays a vital role in NLP tasks. Better embedding models are more likely\nto fetch similarities across contexts and help identify highly relevant context. Besides the BERT\nmodel used in the state-of-the-art reranker, many promising embedding models have been proposed\nrecently. To evaluate the effectiveness of different embedding models, i.e., BERT [ 6], GTE [ 22], BGE\n[44], Ember [ 24], we conduct the experiments under the same setting as G-RAG-RL. The results are\npresented in Table 3. For convenience, we directly add two results from Section 4.2: BART-GST\nand BERT. Ember performs consistently well across all evaluations. In conclusion, Ember appears\nto be the top-performing model, followed closely by GTE and BGE, while BART-GST and BERT\nshow slightly lower performance across the evaluated metrics. Thus our fine-tuning result is based\non G-RAG-RL with Ember as the embedding model. The grid search setting for hyperparameter is\nintroduced in Section 4.1. We only run 10k iterations for each setting and pick up the one with the\nbest MRR. The result with hyperparameter tuning, i.e., Ember (HPs-T), is added in Table 3. Even\nthough BART-GST demonstrates competitive performance in some scenarios, it is prone to overfitting\n8\nespecially in terms of MRR on the NQ dataset. However, the proposed methods, i.e., Ember and\nEmber (HPs-T), are more likely to avoid overfitting and achieve the highest score across all test sets.\nNQ TQA\nembedding MRR MH MRR MH\nBART-GST 28.4 25.0 53.2 48.7 17.5 17.6 39.1 39.5\nBERT 27.3 25.7 49.2 47.4 19.8 18.3 42.9 39.4\nGTE 29.9 26.3 52.6 47.7 19.2 19.3 41.8 40.3\nBGE 28.7 27.4 52.1 48.2 18.7 18.3 43.4 40.7\nEmber 9.0 26.1 52.9 48.0 19.8 18.6 44.3 42.0\nEmber (HPs-T) 28.9 27.7 51.1 50.0 20.0 19.4 41.6 41.4\nTable 3: G-RAG with changing the embedding model.\n4.4 Investigating PaLM 2 Scores\nTo evaluate the performance of large language models on the reranking task, we conduct zero-short\nexperiments on the dev & test sets of the NQ and TQA datasets. An example of LLM-generated\nrelevance score is illustrated in Figure 5 in the Appendix.\nIn general, we observe that scores generated by PaLM 2 are integers between 0 and 100 that are\ndivisible by 5. This often leads to ties in documents rankings. To address the ties in the ranking score,\nwe use the proposed metrics MTRR (Eq. 11) and TMHits@10 (Eq. 12) to evaluate the performance of\nreranker based on PaLM 2 [ 9]. For the convenience of comparison, we copy w/o rerank , BART,\nand G-RAG results from Section 4.2. Since there is no tied ranking provided by w/o rerank and\nBART, the MRR and MHits@10 have the same values as MTRR and TMhits@10, respectively.\nThe performance results are provided in Table 2. The results demonstrate that LLMs with zero-shot\nlearning does not do well in reranking tasks. This may be caused by too many ties in the relevance\nscores, especially for small-size LLM where there are more of them. This result emphasizes the\nimportance of reranking model design in RAG even in the LLM era. More qualitative examples based\non PaLM 2 are provided in Appendix C.\nWe compare the results of both approaches with G-RAG which brings additional perspective to these\nresults. Leveraging the information about connections of entities across documents and documents\nthemselves brings significant improvements up to 7 percentage points.\n5 Conclusions\nOur proposed model, G-RAG, addresses limitations in existing ODQA methods by leveraging\nimplicit connections between documents and strategically integrating AMR information. Our method\nidentifies documents with valuable information significantly better even when this information is\nonly weakly connected to the question context. This happens because documents connected by\nthe document graph share information that is relevant for the final answer. We integrate key AMR\ninformation to improve performance without increasing computational cost. We also proposed two\nmetrics to fairly evaluate the performance of a wide range of ranking scenarios including tied ranking\nscores. Furthermore, our investigation into the performance of PaLM 2 as a reranker emphasizes\nthe significance of reranker model design in RAG, as even an advanced pre-trained LLM might face\nchallenges in the reranking task.\nRecently, papers such as [ 27,36] introduced methods for reranking listwise documents using LLMs.\nDespite this, our proposed metric MTRR remains valid for comparison with their approaches mea-\nsured by MRR (mentioned in paper [ 27]). Thus our method has potential for broader adoption and\ncomparison with existing approaches. Additionally, we\u2019re enthusiastic about investigating more\nadvanced techniques to efficiently resolve ties in ranking scores produced by LLMs. There are more\ndirections for future study. For instance, designing more sophisticated models to better process\nAMR information and integrating this information into node & edge features will bring further\nimprovements in reranking. Further, while a pre-trained LLM does not have impressive performance\nas a reranker itself, fine-tuning it may be extremely useful for enhancing the performance of RAG\nsystems.\n9\nReferences\n[1]Akari Asai, Kazuma Hashimoto, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Richard Socher, and Caiming Xiong.\nLearning to retrieve reasoning paths over wikipedia graph for question answering.

We analyze the shortest single\nsource paths (SSSPs) in the AMR graphs of documents and try to establish the connection between\nquestion contexts and document contexts. The analysis reveals a notable trend in the AMR graphs of\ndocuments, indicating that certain negative documents cannot establish adequate connections to the\nquestion context within their text. This pattern brings insights into the encoding process to enhance\nreranking performance.\n(a) NQ-train\n (b) NQ-train\n (c) NQ-dev\n (d) NQ-dev\n(e) NQ-test\n (f) NQ-test\n (g) TQA-train\n (h) TQA-train\n(i) TQA-dev\n (j) TQA-dev\n (k) TQA-test\n (l) TQA-test\nFigure 2: Number of nodes and edges in AMR graphs in train/dev/test set of dataset NQ and TQA.\n14\n(a) NQ-Positive\n (b) NQ-Negative\n (c) TQA-Positive\n (d) TQA-Negative\nFigure 3: Number of SSSPs AMR graphs in train set of dataset NQ and TQA.\nFigure 4: The pipeline of G-RAG.\nB Simulation Results with Different GNN Models.\nBesides the GCN [ 17] model considered in the main manuscript, we compare the simulation results\nwith different GNN models in this section. Specifically, under the same setting as the GCN model in\nEmber (HPs-T) from Table 3, we use GAT [ 39] with additional parameter number of heads being 8,\nGraphSage [ 10] with the aggregation choice being \u2018lstm\u2019, and GIN [ 45] with the aggregation choice\nbeing \u2018mean\u2019. The comparison results are illustrated in Table 5. For the convenience of comparison,\nwe directly add two results from Section 4.2, i.e., BART-GST and GCN (i.e., Ember (HPs-T) in Table\n3). It shows that the GCN model still outperforms in most cases. This may be due to the document\ngraphs considered in our paper being very small, while the advanced GNN model usually targets\nhandling thousands, or millions of nodes in the graph. Besides, our model has already taken the edge\nfeature into consideration, which may lead to overfitting if introducing more weight parameters.\nNQ TQA\nEmbedding\n/MetricMRR_dev MRR_test MH_dev MH_test MRR_dev MRR_test MH_dev MH_test\nBART-GST 28.4 25.0 53.2 48.7 17.5 17.6 39.1 39.5\nGCN 28.9 27.7 51.1 50.0 20.0 19.4 41.6 41.4\nGAT 28.1 27.1 52.3 47.2 19.1 18.9 43.0 41.0\nGraphSage 29.8 26.5 52.3 47.2 19.6 18.4 42.9 39.7\nGIN 28.4 27.8 50.2 48.5 19.7 18.9 42.2 39.3\nTable 5: Results of G-RAG with different GNN models.

However, if a document includes word variations or lacks\nsufficient keywords, it poses a challenge for the baseline reranker to identify its relevance, see the 9th\nand 10th documents. To address this issue, the AMR graph of documents is used in our method to\ncomprehend more intricate semantics. The SSSPs from the \u2018question\u2019 node in the AMR graph also\nplay the crucial role in uncovering the underlying connections between the question and the words in\nthe documents.\nAnother challenging scenario for the baseline reranker arises when several keywords or even gold\nanswers are present in the documents but are weakly connected, making recognition difficult. For\nexample, in the 7th, 8th, and 9th documents there are both \u201cOl\u2019 Blue Eyes\" and \u201cSinatra\" which are\ngold answers, yet these words are not directly linked as the sentence: \u201cOl\u2019 Blue Eyes is the nickname\nof \u201cSinatra\". Instead, the connection between these two words is very loose. Luckily, the 7th, 8th, and\n9th documents are connected to the 1st document in the document graph due to common nodes like\n\u2019Sinatra\u2019 and \u2019Ol Blue Eyes.\u2019 The 1st document stands out as more easily identifiable as a positive\ndocument, given its incorporation of all keywords from the questions. These words not only have a\nstrong connection but also collectively contribute to a cohesive answer to the question. Leveraging\nthis information and employing a message-passing mechanism, we can enable the 7th, 8th, and 9th\n18\ndocument to adeptly discern potential keywords. Consequently, this approach enhances their ranking,\nbased on the insights derived from the well-connected and information-rich 1st document.\nD Examples of LLM-generate Relevant Score\nSome examples of LLM-generate relevant score are illustrated in Fig 5.\nTo what extent is the following passage relevant to the given question?

Clarke and Knake (2010)  define cyber war-\nfare as \u201cactions by a nation -state to penetrate another nation's computers or networks for the pur-\nposes of causing damage or disruption\u201d (p. 292). But this definition is quite limited, as it does not \ninclude non -state actors, e.g. hacktivists, groups and corporate espionage. Moreover, the re is an \nopen discussion whether cyber warfare itself can be seen as a \u2018real war\u2019 as there are no physical \n\u2018front lines\u2019 to it (Schneier, 2010; Missiroli, 2019). This paper argues, however, that the very notion of \ncyber warfare suits Carl von Clausewitz' d efinition of war, as \" war is thus an act of force to compel \nour enemy to do our will \" (Clausewitz et al., 1984) and that is exactly what cyber warfare does:  \ncompels an opponent to fulfil the attacker\u2019s will, as an attacker regards cyber attacks as an inte gral \npart of its offensive strategy to the achievement of its national objectives.  \n \nAdditionally, alongside with three distinct battlefields of the hybrid warfare:   the conventional bat-\ntleground, the indigenous population caught in a conflict, and the international community (McCuen, 2008, p.107), cyberspace has recently been recognized as a new battlefield area for competition \namong states and has been officially declared as a \u201c fifth operational domain \u201d, equal to land, sea, air, \nand space, which makes it to a space where a \u2018war\u2019 between states can take place. Ultimately, cyber \nwarfare has transformed into an additional challenge to international and national security, and \ncyber attacks have added a new dimension to the overall concept of war as they see m to turn into \none of the most preferred methods of warfare. The reasons for that are addressed in the next sub-\nchapter.  \n \n \n3.1 The Rise of Cyber Domain as a New Strategic Challenge  \n \nIn comparison to conventional wars, cyber operations are relatively cheap to undertake, quite widely \naccessible to both states and non -state actors but, at the same time, they also generate higher im-\npact and an opportunity to wage war covertly, i.e. withou t a physical confrontation and a declaration \nof war. Additionally, the actor behind cyber attacks is hard to identify, trace down and be proven guilty due to the usual absence of direct evidence and a straightforward international legal frame-\nwork (Grisby, 2017; Georgieva, 2020). Thus, there is no clear set of rules of war and regulatory com-pliance mechanisms applicable to cyber warfare as the possibility and the extent to which the UN Charter or the Law of Armed Conflict or the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNDHR) can be \neffectively applied to cyber conflicts remains highly debated. Therefore, Geers (2015) argues that \nstates will prefer to wage cyber wars as \u201cthey offer varying degrees of covertness and their treat-\nment under international law remain s ambiguous\u201d (p. 41). Yet, an international consensus regarding \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000178.249.194.48 on Mon, 15 Apr 2024 18:59:20 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Use of Cyberspace in the Context of Hybrid W arfare.  \nMeans, Challenges and Trends                                                                         oiip Working Paper 107 / 2020  \n     \n \n17 \n the legal status of cyber warfare is potentially forthcoming and is already in the process of discus-\nsions within numerous conferences on cyber security across the world.  \n \nThe current absence of norms of \u2018good behaviour\u2019 and transparency, however, increases the uncer-\ntainty about the intentions of another state, which, in turn, drives states to a classical security di-\nlemma (Buchanan, 2016). Hence, Leuprecht et. al. (2019)  argue that the main cha llenge that cyber \nweapons and cyber operations possess is the uncertainty as of whether the actors use cyber space for offensive or defensive purposes (p.385). Moreover, there is uncertainty about the target coun-\ntry\u2019s or international community\u2019s response to cyber attacks. Can it be a war crime? Should or can NATO invoke Article 5? Will it rather create a boomerang effect? Can states file a retaliation com-plaint? Therefore technology -aided warfare can be characterised as a \u201cdouble -edge sword\u2019\u2019 as in-\nformatio n dominance increases your hard and/or soft power, but at the same time, makes you vul-\nnerable (Rattray, 2001; Dunn Cavelty and Wenger, 2020, p.15). Yet many states are developing their cyber capabilities due to the strategic benefits of cyber weapons. Howe ver, alongside the develop-\nment of cyber programmes and rules of engagement regarding the use of cyber space, the cyber \nspace and IT sector are rapidly changing and become more complex and increasingly sophisticated. \nThat is why it is widely agreed that cyb er-enabled technology is inevitably going to change the inter-\nnational and national security environment. In this context, the following chapter aims to present the \ntypes of cyber attacks and investigate the emerging trends in cyber warfare.\n \n \n \n3.2 Types of Cyber Attacks and Trends in Cyber Warfare  \n \nNowadays, cyber attacks are a matter of growing international concern due to their increasing so-phistication and greater frequency. This, in turn, was a result of the evolution of attack technologies, \nthe occurrence of state- sponsored cyber campaigns targe ting government units, and greater inter-\nconnectivity among hackers, which have made cyber threats more \u201c ubiquitous \u201d and severe. There-\nfore, this chapter seeks to shed light on the shifting meaning of cyber security that has been changing \nalong with an evolv ing set and frequency of cyber attacks. The challenge of cyber attacks  to national \ncyber security used to be discussed primarily almost exclusively among American think tanks and war colleges in term of \u201cwhat -if\u201d scenario. However, the frequency of such ev ents, like Russian attacks on \nweb pages of Estonian official institutions in 2007, Stuxnet in 2010 \u2013  a malware aiming at nuclear \nfacilities, large -scale DDoS attacks on JP Morgan and Bank of America in 2012 by Iranian hackers, \nseveral cyber attacks on Saud i Arabia\u2019s national oil company in 2012, and Snowden disclosures in \n2013 have shifted the focus towards research that can be useful in the policy -making process.  \n \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000178.249.194.48 on Mon, 15 Apr 2024 18:59:20 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Use of Cyberspace in the Context of Hybrid W arfare.  \nMeans, Challenges and Trends                                                                         oiip Working Paper 107 / 2020  \n     \n \n18 \n Against this background,  national governments have given increasing political attention to develop-\ning and strengthening national cyber capabilities for defensive and offensive purposes. As a result,  \nnumerous national cyber security centres, (e.g. Germany's Nationales Cyber -Abwehrzentrum in 2011, \nthe U.S. Cyber Command in 2008 or the UK\u2019s Nationa l Cyber Security Centre in 2016), as well as bi-\nlateral initiatives (e.g. the U.S. - Japan Cyber Defense Policy Working Group in 2013 or the Warsaw \nProcess Working Group on Cyber security in 2019 ) and international missions/organizations (e.g. \nNATO's Cooper ative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in 2008 or the European Cyber Security Or-\nganisation in 2016), were established. Yet more and more states are trying to increase their cyber \npower as cyber warfare enables them to achieve their political objectives o utside of the cyber do-\nmain because cyber warfare can significantly influence the distribution of power among states while \nnot provoking a direct military confrontation ( Dunn Cavelty and Wenger, 2020, p.12).  \n \nBy all means, the actions of nation -state actor s in the cyber domain have broadened the scope of \ncyber attacks. Firstly, there are non -state and state- sponsored actors performing strategic cyber at-\ntacks against critical infrastructure entities and hacking into corporate networks in order to steal  \ninformation on specific individuals or plant viruses and spyware. Secondly, there are state -sponsored \ninformation warfare operations in the cyber domain, which are deliberately employed as data ma-\nnipulation attacks, e.g. to intentionally influence public opinio n by using trolls and bots to shape In-\nternet content, and/or spreading misinformation  in order to undermine public trust in national insti-\ntutions. However, while the cyber space creates new opportunities for social manipulation, this pa-\nper defines cyber wa rfare in terms of the use of technology to attack and damage another nation\u2019s \ncritical infrastructure and/or to access and expose personal information. This definition separates the blurred lines between cyber warfare operations and information warfare ope rations. Hence, cyber \nattacks/operations are defined as:  \n \n\u2022 \u201cExamples of the use of new technologies within the scope of hybrid threats\u201d (D\u00f6ge, 2010 as cited in \nBachmann and Gunneriusson, 2015, p. 82);  \n\u2022 \u201cA modern form of political warfare, with major implications for coercive policy options and cyber \nstrategies\u201d ( Atlantic Council Blog, 2018);  \n\u2022 Means to \u201cmanipulate, deny, disrupt, degrade, or destroy targeted computers, information systems or \nnetworks\u201d (Hogeveen and Hanson, 2018);  \n\u2022 \u201cAttempts to damage an adversary through attacking computers, information networks or any other \nfacet of the modern Information Technology (IT) society \u201d  (Hughes and Shaffer, 2020, p. 300).  \n \n \nThis content downloaded from \n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000178.249.194.48 on Mon, 15 Apr 2024 18:59:20 +00:00\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms\nThe Use of Cyberspace in the Context of Hybrid W arfare.  \nMeans, Challenges and Trends                                                                         oiip Working Paper 107 / 2020  \n     \n \n19 \n Accordingly, cyber weapons are used as tools of coercion and cover a wide range of activities that \nstate-  and non -state actors can utilize to inflict damage (Claver, 2018, p. 158; Leuprecht et. al, 2019, \npp. 382 -383). Cyber attacks can be divided into \u201csyntactic attacks\u201d via malicious software, which im-\nplies viruses and worms attacking u sers; and \u201csemantic attacks\u201d that attack infrastructures or IT facil-\nities by modifying data unnoticeably, e.g. phishing and malvertising (Knopov\u00e1 and Knopov\u00e1, 2014, pp. \n25-26). Besides that, there is also an alarming trend of cyber espionage by state -spons ored cyber \ngroups . Table 1  provides a detailed overview of this trend based on the results of the research analy-\nsis presented by Osawa (2017). As of 2018, there were 41 cyber hackers associated with the Russian, \nChinese, Iranian, and North Korean governments, who have allegedly  conducted  state -sponsored \nespionage just against the United States by targeting government agencies, banks, health care indus-\ntry, international organizations and businesses in order to achieve their respective political objectives  \n(Kiefer et. al., 2019) .  \n \nOsawa (2017) argues that an overriding trend towards state -sponsored cyber attacks can be proven \nby the fact that thes e attacks \u201cfrequently follow incidents of international discord or conflict\u201d (p. \n115). Thus, the annexation of Crimea in 2014, in particular, became the focus of the renewed conflict between Russia and the US. Since then, Russia has been accused of large -scale cyber attacks against \nthe U.S., as well as Ukraine and NATO member states. The most prominent of these accusations is \nRussia\u2019s attempts to access the critical infrastructure and elections systems in Ukraine. According to \nthe report provided by the Int ernational Foundation of Electoral System, several days before the \npresidential elections in 2014 Russian hackers allegedly launched a cyber attack on Ukraine\u2019s Central \nElection Commission to influence the outcome of an election. More details on this trend  will be pro-\nvided in Chapter 4.  \n \nThe growing importance of the \u201cDark Web\u201d and an increasing amount of opportunities that it creates \nfor people constitutes another emerging trend in cyber warfare. The \u201cDark Web\u201d does not only con-\ntribute to cyber -attacks be coming more frequent, as it provides criminal groups and terrorists with a \npossibility to remain undetected and go unpunished  but, moreover, it stimulates their professional \ndevelopment. As the \u201cDark Web\u201d serves as a discussion forum and offers access to t he latest hacking \ntools, cyber groups develop more sophisticated hacking methods and techniques and, as a result, \nbecome more organized and professionalized. Lastly, there is a trend of increased use of artificial \nintelligence (AI), which can serve as a cy ber defence tool that helps to detect and resolve malware \nand/or cyber incidents.

        "text": "This page intentionally left blank\nIntelligence for an Age of Terror\nDuring the Cold War, U.S. intelligence was concerned primarily withstates; nonstate actors like terrorists were secondary. Now, the priori-ties are reversed \u2013 and the challenge is enormous. States had an address,and they were hierarchical and bureaucratic; thus, they came with a\u201cstory.\u201d Terrorists do not. States were \u201cover there,\u201d but terrorists arethere and here. Therefore, they put pressure on intelligence at home, notjust abroad. They also force intelligence and law enforcement \u2013 the Cen-tral Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) \u2013 to work together in new ways, and, if those 700,000 police of\ufb01-cers in the United States are to be the \u201ceyes and ears\u201d in the \ufb01ght againstterrorism, new means of sharing not only information but also analysisacross the federal system are imperative. The strength of this book is thatit underscores the extent of the change and ranges broadly across data col-lection and analysis, both foreign and domestic, and it presents the issuesof value that arise as new targets require the collection of more informa-tion at home.Gregory F. Treverton is director of the RAND Corporation\u2019s Centerfor Global Risk and Security. Earlier, he directed RAND\u2019s IntelligencePolicy Center and its International Security and Defense Policy Centerand was associate dean of the Pardee RAND Graduate School. His recentwork has focused on terrorism, intelligence, and law enforcement, with aspecial interest in new forms of public\u2013private partnership. Dr. Trevertonhas served in government for the \ufb01rst Senate Select Committee on Intel-ligence, handling Europe for the National Security Council (NSC); mostrecently, he served as vice chair of the National Intelligence Estimates(NIEs). He holds a B.A. summa cum laude from Princeton Universityand a master\u2019s degree in public policy and a Ph.D. in economics and poli-tics, both from Harvard University.

At the begin-\nning of the last chapter of that earlier book, completed before September 11,I observed that the book had been mostly about how intelligence should reshapein continued fair weather for globalization. What, I asked, might turn that weatherfouler? The \ufb01rst excursion I considered was a major terrorist attack on the UnitedStates (the other, haunting from the perspective of 2009, was a global economiccollapse). This is hardly prescient \u2013 a stream of blue-ribbon panels had predictedan attack, sometime.\nI imagined that an attack would make intelligence more important, which has\nturned out to be the case and thus became a reason for this book. (The otherprediction I made was that military instruments would not turn out to be veryrelevant, and so military budgets would decline. On that score, I was either wrongor premature \u2013 depending on whether the war in Iraq is regarded as central to or adiversion from the \ufb01ght against terror.) It struck me then, and continues to strikeme now, that for all our talk about terrorism and other transnational threats as thepreeminent targets of intelligence, the implications of that shift run much deeperthan is usually realized. That became a second reason for doing this book.\nAs usual, the book accreted as much as it was written, as I drew on and adapted\nwork done for other purposes. In the process, I incurred intellectual debts to alarge number of colleagues, not all of whom I name here. My old friend PhilipBobbitt and I have come to many similar conclusions about the market state andabout intelligence in an age of terror, sometimes by different routes, and I amalways stimulated by talking with or reading him. John Parachini, who directsRAND\u2019s Intelligence Policy Center, has been a sparring partner for ideas through-out. RAND has provided support of a more tangible sort, \ufb01rst to assess the 2004intelligence act and outline the next steps, then to work on drafting this book.\nAfter September 11th, I had the opportunity to build up RAND\u2019s analytic sup-\nport for the FBI \u2013 \ufb01rst in a review of the Bureau\u2019s internal security in the wake\nvii\nviii Preface\nof the Robert Hanssen spy case and a blue-ribbon panel report, and most recentlyin a congressionally mandated assessment of the pros and cons of establishing adomestic intelligence service separated from law enforcement, a project of whichthe FBI was not the sponsor but in which it did have a keen interest. The workhas been for me a fascinating introduction to a very different organizational cul-ture than traditional intelligence, one I\u2019ve come to admire in many respects. Evenbetter, Bruce Ciske of the Bureau has been my informal guide throughout thatintroduction \u2013 a distinct professional and personal pleasure.\nMy chapter on analysis draws on work commissioned by the then\u2013Assistant\nDirector of Central Intelligence for Analysis and Production, Mark Lowenthal,and his deputy, Bill Nolte. I am grateful to them for that chance to snoop aroundthe analysis shops in the intelligence community, and to my then\u2013RAND col-league in that venture, Bryan Gabbard. I\u2019m also grateful to Roger George andJim Bruce, longtime colleagues, the latter now at RAND, whose edited volume onanalysis gave me the chance to think more about \u201cpoliticization.\u201d\nThe chapter on analysis and the sections on learning organizations draw on a\nchapter commissioned by the CIA for a book on the psychology of intelligenceanalysis. The editor of that book, Dr. Richard Rees, worked over my chapterharder and more creatively than any editor ever has \u2013 all to my bene\ufb01t. Alas, thebook\u2019s fate is a kind of parable for the challenges U.S. intelligence faces. Clearedas unclassi\ufb01ed, the CIA still decided not to publish the book \u2013 because an \u201cof\ufb01cial\u201dpublication by the CIA was thought to sanction comments that were critical, albeitintended as constructive criticism. The result was thus the oddity of an unclassi\ufb01edbook that is available only on the CIA\u2019s highly classi\ufb01ed computer system.\nFinally, I have had the good fortune for the past several years to be a some-\ntime visiting professor at the Swedish National Defence College. Only the Swedeswould invite a foreigner to develop an intelligence program at their nationaldefense college, but they have, happily. It has given me opportunity and incentiveto think comparatively across a range of issues from the nature of the target andhow to deal with \u201ccomplexities,\u201d to how to engage both new customers and privatecitizens in jointly producing useful intelligence. I thank my colleagues there, espe-cially Wilhelm Agrell, Lars Nicander, Jan Leijonhielm, and Magnus Ranstorp.\nI owe debts of other sorts to two other people, to whom I dedicate this book.\nThe late Richard E. Neustadt, my friend, mentor, and colleague, \ufb01rst introducedme to the particularities of the political \u201ctribe\u201d when I was a graduate student. Theexample of his graceful prose left a lifelong appreciation for the power of a four-word sentence. The other is my wife, Karen \u2013 partner, friend, and more throughoutthe writing of this book and the rest of life\u2019s adventures. Needless to say, none ofthese good people should be held responsible for any shortcomings that remain.Those are mine alone.Paci\ufb01c Palisades, California January 6, 2009\nAcronyms\nSymbol

whenthe \ufb01rst wave of terrorist attacks struck: September 11, 2001, in theUnited States; March 11, 2004, in Spain; and July 7, 2005, in Britain \u2013dubbed \u201c9/11,\u201d \u201c3/11,\u201d and \u201c7/7.\u201d They had not absorbed the effectof one major change when they were hit by yet another. Thus, intel-ligence is being reshaped under this onrush of events. Especially inthe United States, it is also being reshaped under the looming shadowof acrimony about emotional issues at the edge of intelligence, issueswith epithets like \u201cGuantanamo\u201d and \u201cAbu Ghraib\u201d and \u201ctorture.\u201dThese epithets with their implications for intelligence are consideredin Chapter 9. The onset of an age of terror has highlighted the roleof intelligence services in detecting and preventing possible terror-ist acts. At the same time, a series of investigations, especially in theUnited States and Britain, has focused attention on the performanceof those intelligence services.\n1If and when the next major attack\ncomes, recriminations about why it was not prevented will make thepost\u2013September 11 debate look decorous.\nThis book begins with where intelligence has been \u2013 the legacy of\ninstitutions and operating practices inherited from the Cold War \u2013 butits purpose is to describe where intelligence needs to go. The requiredreshaping is dramatic. In the United States, the process began with theTerrorism Prevention and Intelligence Reform Act of 2004; however,that law was the bare beginning of the reshaping, hardly the end. Itis intriguing that all the countries that took intelligence seriously dur-ing the Cold War face some version of the same challenges: they have\n1\n2 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 1.1.

In anage of terror, they all face the need to collect more information abouttheir inhabitants: How can they do so without trampling on privacyand civil liberties? The challenges vary in scope and circumstances,but they are kindred across countries. This book draws comparisonsacross nations to illuminate issues, especially arrangements for domes-tic intelligence.\nWith the end of the Cold War and, a decade later, the onset of\nMuslim extremist terrorism, the task of intelligence changed dramati-cally. Table 1.1 summarizes the major differences.\nThese changes frame all subsequent chapters, with a number of\nthemes common throughout. One theme is risk. Intelligence alwayshas been a hedge against risk but now, as the nature of the threat haschanged, so has the nature of the risk. Terrorists who are willing todie for their cause as suicide bombers, for example, cannot be deterredfrom acting in any way similar to the way that states could. Thus, thereis even more pressure on intelligence, which now has to be not merelygood enough to structure deterrent threats. Rather, it also needs toreach deeply into small groups \u2013 their proclivities and capabilities \u2013to provide an understanding that can lead to preventive action. Asthe Irish Republican Army (IRA) stated after that group\u2019s bombing\nIntroduction 3\nof a Brighton hotel in 1984 failed to kill Prime Minister MargaretThatcher, \u201cToday we were unlucky, but remember we only have tobe lucky once. You will have to be lucky always.\u201d\n2\nA second theme is the corresponding expansion in the consumers\nof intelligence. National intelligence used to be designed primarily fora relatively small set of political and military leaders of states. Now,in principle, it could be of use to a huge number of consumers, frompolice of\ufb01cers on the beat to private-sector managers of major infras-tructure. Intelligence has moved, according to the catchphrase, fromthe \u201cneed to know\u201d to the \u201cneed to share\u201d \u2013 a catchphrase that cap-tures the diagnosis but badly poses the remedy.\nA third theme is the increased number of needs for \u2013 and, there-\nfore, types of \u2013 intelligence across a variety of time horizons fromimmediate warning to longer term understanding. Much of the ColdWar intelligence was puzzle-solving, looking for additional pieces to\ufb01ll out a mosaic of understanding whose broad shape was a given.\n3\nThose puzzles \u2013 for example, \u201cHow many warheads does a Soviet mis-sile carry?\u201d \u2013 could be solved with certainty if we only had access toinformation that, in principle, was available. Puzzle-solving is induc-tive. Mysteries are different; no evidence can settle them de\ufb01nitivelybecause they are typically about people, not things. They are contin-gent; that is, mystery-framing is deductive \u2013 the analysis begins wherethe evidence ends.\nThere were mysteries during the Cold War, but the age of terror\nseems especially rife with them. For instance, many of another na-tion\u2019s military capabilities could be treated as a puzzle during the ColdWar and assessed by counting tanks, divisions, and rockets. Now, how-ever, even the capabilities of terrorists are a mystery: those capabili-tiesdepend, not least, on us. Given the lethality of even a single suicide\nbomber, what can be counted is not of much use to count.\nA \ufb01nal overarching theme is boundaries \u2013 of both law and organi-\nzation. During the Cold War, democratic societies drew boundaries \u2013with varying degrees of sharpness \u2013 between intelligence and lawenforcement, between home and abroad, and between public and pri-vate. The \ufb01rst two boundaries, in particular, were drawn to protect theprivacy and civil liberties of a nation\u2019s citizens. In the circumstancesof the Cold War, those boundaries made sense. However, they setup nations to fail against a terrorist foe who respects none of those\n4 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nboundaries. Now, the balance between security and privacy is beingstruck anew and, in the process, the organizational distinctions \u2013 suchas between intelligence and law enforcement \u2013 are being erased.\nchanged targets and a mismatched legacy\nAs an intelligence challenge, transnational targets such as terroristsdiffer from traditional state targets in a number of ways, which aresummarized in Table 1.1. Chapter 2 describes the shift in more detail.Transnational targets are not new; intelligence has long been activeagainst organized crime and drug traf\ufb01ckers but as a secondary activ-ity. Although state targets of intelligence will remain \u2013 Iran, NorthKorea, China, and Russia, for example \u2013 the shift to terrorists as aprimary target is momentous. First, while the current Islamic extrem-ist terrorists hardly act quickly but instead carefully plan their attacksover years, transnational targets are less bounded than state-centrictargets. There will be discontinuities in targets and attack modes, andnew groups will emerge unpredictably.\nSecond, intelligence ultimately is storytelling. It is helping policy\nmakers build or adjust stories in light of new or additional informationor arguments. However, the new transnational targets deprive bothintelligence and policy of a shared story that would facilitate analysisand communication. We knew what states were like, even very differ-ent states such as the Soviet Union: they were geographical, hierar-chical, and bureaucratic. There is no comparable story for nonstates,which come in many sizes and shapes.\nThird, given that U.S. foes were closed societies, Cold War intel-\nligence (including analysis) gave pride of place to secrets \u2013 that is,information gathered by human and technical means that intelligence\u201cowned.\u201d Terrorists are hardly open, but an avalanche of open datais relevant to them: witness the September 11 hijackers whose realaddresses were available in California motor-vehicle records. Duringthe Cold War, the problem was too little information; now, the prob-lem is too much. Then, intelligence\u2019s secrets were deemed reliable;now, the torrents on the Web are a stew of fact, fancy, and disinfor-mation.\nFinally, and perhaps most portentous, terrorists shape themselves\naround us; that was hardly the case for the Soviet Union. As former\nIntroduction 5\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown quipped about the U.S.\u2013Soviet nuclear competition, \u201cWhen we build, they build. When wecut, they build.\u201d\n4Although various countries \u2013 especially the United\nStates \u2013 hoped that their policies would in\ufb02uence Moscow, as a \ufb01rstapproximation, intelligence analysts could presume that they wouldnot. The Soviet Union would do what it would do. The challenge, inthe \ufb01rst instance, was \ufb01guring out its likely course, not calibrating thein\ufb02uence that other nations might have over that course.\nThe terrorist target, however, is utterly different. It is the ultimate\nasymmetric threat, shaping its capabilities to our vulnerabilities. TheSeptember 11 suicide bombers did not come up with their attack planbecause they were airline buffs. They knew that fuel-\ufb01lled jets in \ufb02ightwere a vulnerable asset, that defensive passenger-clearance proce-dures were weak, and that the scheme obviated the need to face amore effective defense against procuring or importing ordnance. Bythe same token, the London, Madrid, and other bombers conductedsuf\ufb01cient tactical reconnaissance to shape their plans to the vulnera-bilities of their targets. To a great extent, we shape the threat to us;it re\ufb02ects our vulnerable assets and weak defenses. As military plan-ners would state, it is impossible to understand red \u2013 that is, potentialfoes \u2013 without knowing a lot about blue \u2013 ourselves \u2013 that is, our ownproclivities and vulnerabilities.\nThat fact has awkward implications for intelligence, especially for-\neign intelligence that in many countries has been enjoined from exam-ining the home front and, less formally, has worried that getting tooclose to \u201cpolicy\u201d is to risk becoming politicized. Moreover, to theextent that intelligence now becomes the net assessment of red againstblue, that too has been the province of the military, not civilian,agencies.\nThe Cold War legacy of intelligence is mismatched to the changed\nthreat. That legacy, the subject of Chapter 3, consists of three parts.The \ufb01rst is the boundaries that were drawn. In an important sense, itshould not be surprising that cooperation between the Central Intel-ligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)before September 11 was ragged at best. Americans wanted it thatway. Out of concern for civil liberties, they decided that the twoagencies should not be too close. The FBI and the CIA sit astridethe fundamental boundaries of the Cold War \u2013 boundaries between\n6 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nintelligence and law enforcement, between foreign and domestic, andbetween public and private. The distinctions run deep. The bound-aries were reinforced by the second legacy: the institutional legacy.\nThe institutional legacy, on the collection side, was an organiza-\ntion of \u201cstovepipes\u201d by source. The clandestine service, or directorateof operations, of the CIA was primarily responsible for espionage, orhuman intelligence (HUMINT); the National Security Agency (NSA)for signals intelligence (SIGINT); and the National Geospatial Intel-ligence Agency (NGA) for pictures and other imagery intelligence(IMINT). There was, perhaps, a certain logic to that organization dur-ing the Cold War. With one overwhelming target \u2013 the Soviet Union \u2013the various \u201cINTs\u201d were asked, in effect, what they could contributeto understanding the puzzle of the Soviet Union.\nFor its part, analysis was organized primarily by agency, not by\nissue or problem. The directorate of intelligence of the CIA was \ufb01rstamong equals, but the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was justas large in numbers, and the much smaller State Department Bureauof Intelligence and Research (INR) tended to punch well above itsweight in interagency discussions. The military services each had theirown intelligence arm, primarily addressing the foreign threats thattheir service\u2019s weaponry would confront; the joint combatant com-mands also had their intelligence units, heavily tactical in orientation.In Washington, there were smaller analytic units in departments rang-ing from Energy to Commerce, which were explicitly departmental,serving the needs of local consumers.\nIf organizing intelligence by source on the collection side and by\nagency on the analysis side made a certain sense during the Cold War,it cannot be the right way to organize now. On the collection side, ifthe terrorist target is more of a mystery than a puzzle, then the ColdWar\u2019s implicit competition among the INTs for puzzle pieces needsto give way to explicit cooperation across those INTs in framing themysteries. Now, moreover, it is not just that there are more targets butalso more consumers and more information \u2013 although the informa-tion is varied in reliability and little of it is owned by intelligence aswere the secret sources during the Cold War.\nThe \ufb01nal Cold War legacy was a product of the boundaries. Domes-\ntic intelligence was a stepchild in the system. Unlike most of its major\nIntroduction 7\npartners, the United States had not created a domestic-intelligenceservice. Rather, the domestic-intelligence function, performed by theFBI, was twice circumscribed. First, it was part of the FBI, which\ufb01rst and foremost was a law enforcement organization. Understand-ing the Cold War FBI through its intelligence function, I realized afterSeptember 11, was like trying to understand the National FootballLeague by interviewing the place-kickers. Intelligence may have beenimportant but it was not central. Second, the domestic-intelligencefunction was limited by the boundary between intelligence and lawenforcement, a \u201cwall\u201d that extended inside the FBI and inhibitedcooperation among intelligence and law enforcement of\ufb01cials work-ing on similar issues.\nthe imperative of change\nIf the boundaries served the democratic nations tolerably well duringthe Cold War \u2013 in particular, by safeguarding the privacy of citizens \u2013they set up those nations to fail in an age of terror. The imperative ofchange is the subject of Chapter 4. Terrorists respected none of thoseboundaries. They were not \u201cover there\u201d; rather, they were both thereand here. Indeed, what is striking now is the contrast between Britainand the United States, countries usually considered as very close.However, for Britain, the terrorist threat had become almost entirely\u201cdomestic\u201d by the mid-2000s, as the 2005 and 2007 attacks on thatcountry demonstrated. The threat resided at home \u2013 although withtentacles reaching abroad, to Pakistan in particular. By contrast, forthe United States, the problem is still primarily \u201cover there,\u201d althoughwith tendrils reaching into this country. Terrorists target not armiesbut rather private citizens. Although they might commit crimes, theymight commit only one \u2013 and then it is too late; they cannot be treatedas either an intelligence or a law enforcement problem but rather asboth.\nThe effect of all these boundaries was vividly on display in the\nrun-up to September 11. By the spring of 2000, two of the hijackers,al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi, were each living under their own name inSan Diego, and the latter even applied for a new visa. The Immigra-tion and Naturalization Service (INS) had no reason to be concerned\n8 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nbecause the CIA had withheld their names from TIPOFF, the basicterrorist watch list. Neither did the FBI have any reason to look forthem \u2013 for instance, by conducting a basic Internet search for theirnames or by querying its informants in Southern California \u2013 becausethe last the FBI knew from the CIA was that the two terroristswere overseas. No agency told the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) to be looking for the two, apparently because the FAA wasnot in the law enforcement business. The airlines were not informedbecause they were private, not public. So, on the morning of Septem-ber 11, four sets of terrorists succeeded in boarding U.S. commer-cial jetliners, and three managed to strike their target: the WorldTrade Center towers in Manhattan and the Pentagon in the nation\u2019scapital.\nIn the United States, the 2004 Act made a start at reshaping intel-\nligence. The Act \u2013 and more so the Senate version of the bill thatwas modi\ufb01ed in conference with the House of Representatives \u2013 pro-posed national intelligence centers under the authority of the newDirector of National Intelligence (DNI) and organized around issuesor missions. The centers, with the National Counterterrorism Center(NCTC) as the prototype, would both deploy and use the informa-tion, technology, and staff resources of the existing agencies: the CIA,DIA, NSA, and others. They would be intelligence\u2019s version of themilitary\u2019s \u201cuni\ufb01ed combatant commands\u201d and would look to the agen-cies to acquire the technological systems, train the people, and executethe operations planned by the national intelligence centers. So far, inaddition to the NCTC, the National Counterproliferation Center isthe only other center to be established, although the DNI has named\u201cmission\u201d managers for North Korea, Iran, and Cuba\u2013Venezuela.\nThe FBI, under Director Robert Mueller, was facing enormous\npressure, and there was considerable talk of creating a new domestic-intelligence agency separate from the Bureau. Mueller, however,moved rapidly to turn the Bureau from almost pure concentration onlaw enforcement to prevention and intelligence. Both Congress andthe postmortem commissions decided to give the FBI time to see ifthe change could be made enduring. The FBI adopted the Weaponsof Mass Destruction (WMD) Commission\u2019s recommendation to cre-ate not only a Directorate of Intelligence (DI) within the FBI butalso a National Security Branch (NSB), incorporating intelligence and\nIntroduction 9\nthe FBI\u2019s Counterterrorism Division (CTD) and CounterintelligenceDivision (CD).\nYet, the 2004 Act marked only the beginning of the change; Chap-\nter 5 lays out the agenda ahead. The main challenge is also the reasonfor having a DNI in the \ufb01rst place \u2013 to better manage the entire setof U.S. intelligence agencies so that the nation gets the most from the$40-plus billion it spends annually on intelligence. John Negroponte,the \ufb01rst DNI, took over control of managing and delivering the\u201ccrown-jewel\u201d analysis \u2013 the President\u2019s Daily Brief (PDB) \u2013 whichhad been the CIA\u2019s product. However, the nation did not need a DNIto deliver the PDB; for that, the former Director of Central Intelli-gence (DCI) was \ufb01ne.\nRather, the DNI needs to be a major player in programmatic deci-\nsions \u2013 of which there was not much evidence in the DNI\u2019s \ufb01rst severalyears \u2013 a need more pressing as the distinction between \u201cnational\u201d and\u201ctactical\u201d systems blurs, meaning that the intelligence agencies andthe Pentagon share systems and compete for priority. This will requirea much greater analytic capacity than what the DNI inherited if he isto be compelling inside the executive branch and with Congress.\nAt present, U.S. collection produces too much data and too lit-\ntle information, and the strategic-management task requires drivingtrade-offs not only across the stovepipes but also within them. U.S.collection techniques, especially for imagery, are fairly well under-stood by targets. Also, the Cold War espionage practices will not workagainst terrorist targets because, alas, Al Qaeda operatives do not goto embassy cocktail parties. The sheer volume of the data, or \u201ctake,\u201dfrom collection, just from intelligence\u2019s own secret sources, threatensto overwhelm the processing of it. The challenge is to be less passiveand quicker in innovation. For signals, that means getting closer to tar-gets. For imagery, it means smaller platforms, increased use of stealth,and employing more of the spectrum. For espionage, it means morediversity in spymasters and moving out of of\ufb01cial cover. However, italso means being patient.\nMeeting these challenges amounts to changing the agencies of the\nintelligence community to adaptive-learning organizations. The needapplies with particular force to intelligence\u2019s most precious asset, itspeople. New recruits, across the community, are very different. Theyare fearless and computer-savvy \u2013 used to communicating, searching,\n10 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nand reaching out. They will not tolerate the information environ-ments \u2013 compartmentalized, slow, and source-driven \u2013 that current in-telligence provides. Neither will they long be satis\ufb01ed with workassignments that amount to, as one put it, \u201ca few square miles of Iraq.\u201dThey seek new challenges in \u201cportfolio careers.\u201d To get and keepthem \u2013 a great opportunity \u2013 intelligence will have to change the wayit structures careers throughout the career cycle \u2013 from mentoring tolateral entry at senior levels. New personnel practices and new formsof training can also build jointness in a legacy of the stovepiped intel-ligence community. Training is similarly stovepiped and scattered; toomuch of it was oriented toward credentials rather than doing better onthe job, and it was not integral to careers. There were no focal pointsfor tool-building and lesson-learning. In all these respects, the DNIalso has an opportunity.\nThe third major agenda item is domestic intelligence. If, thus far,\nthe United States and its leaders have opted not to create a domestic-intelligence agency separate from law enforcement, the question ofwhether to do so will remain on the agenda. Another major terroristattack would drive it immediately to the top. On this score, althoughinternational comparisons cannot settle the question for the UnitedStates, they are particularly apt because almost all of America\u2019s prin-cipal partners in the age of terror have chosen to separate domesticintelligence and law enforcement into distinct government agencies.For the United States, the choice is ultimately whether the consid-erable transition costs \u2013 costs driven home by the experience of theDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) \u2013 are justi\ufb01ed by potentialimprovements in domestic intelligence, especially in the value of whatis collected and the value added by analysis.\nA critical part of the agenda is intelligence analysis, the subject of\nChapter 6. The postmortems in the United States, more so than inBritain, were scathing in regard to analysis \u2013 for instance, the WMDCommission on intelligence before the Iraq war: \u201cThis failure was inlarge part the result of analytical shortcomings; intelligence analystswere too wedded to their assumptions about Saddam\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n5\nThe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was equally scathingabout the October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), con-cluding: \u201cMost of the major key judgments ...e i t h e r overstated, or\nwere not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A series\nIntroduction 11\nof failures, particularly in analytic tradecraft, led to the mischaracter-ization of the intelligence.\u201d\n6\nThere are no easy solutions to improving analysis; legislation or\nreorganization or exhortation cannot produce more creativity. Theshortcomings run deep into organizational culture; for instance, mostintelligence analysis in the U.S. government has made little use ofeither machines or formal methods. Thus, there is no substitute for arich variety of pilot projects and experiments, many of which involvedramatic departures from current practice. For instance, psycholo-gists tell us that harried people are not likely to be creative; creativ-ity requires some \u201cdown\u201d time for re\ufb02ection. However, intelligenceanalysts are now frantic all the time; therefore, creating special unitsenjoined from immediate production but encouraged to think makessense yet cuts against the organizational grain \u2013 not to mention thepolitical imperative of wringing any possible waste from the system!\nImproving analysis requires putting consumers at the center of the\nprocess. Ultimately, analysis is not information nor is it elegant papersre\ufb02ecting deep judgment. Rather, it is improved understanding by thepeople who have to make a decision. Intelligence, and especially anal-ysis, will not be truly reshaped until it changes how it considers itsproducts. When I oversaw the National Intelligence Council (NIC)estimates, I realized that the NIEs were not our real product. Rather,it was National Intelligence Of\ufb01cers (NIOs) \u2013 that is, not paper butpeople, experts in a position to attend meetings and offer judgment.A starting point for the reshaping would be recognizing that analysis\nshould be plural, encompassing many consumers with many differentneeds for intelligence.\nmany consumers, too many secrets\nThe mushrooming of consumers compounds the challenge of com-munication between intelligence and its consumers \u2013 the subject ofChapter 7. Communication was already dif\ufb01cult at the federal levelbefore September 11. The speci\ufb01c concern in the WMD debate waspoliticization: the risk that intelligence would be under pressure \u2013 usu-ally more implicit than explicit \u2013 to produce assessments that suitedthe preferences of national administrations. Yet, protection againstpoliticization needs to be balanced against its opposite: intelligence\n12 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthat is not relevant to any policy question at issue. At the NIC, Ithought almost all the work we did was interesting, but I distinguished\u201cinteresting\u201d from \u201cinteresting and useful\u201d \u2013 that is, an answer to a\nquestion that the policy world was asking in some form. Perhaps themore subtle danger for the future, as in the run-up to the Iraq war, isthat government leaders will feel impelled to use intelligence to jus-tify their policies, which puts intelligence in an unwanted and publicposition.\nNow, the consumer \u201ctribe\u201d has become vastly larger and more het-\nerogeneous \u2013 including 700,000 law enforcement of\ufb01cers in 18,000 gov-ernment jurisdictions, not to mention the private-sector managers of\u201cpublic\u201d infrastructure, such as information, banking, and transporta-tion. The federal agencies call reaching out to them \u201cinformation-sharing,\u201d which is the wrong approach on many grounds. It impliesthat agencies own their information, to be shared only as they see\ufb01t, and that the challenge is primarily technical; that is, if only thepipes were big enough to let the information \ufb02ow all the way to thecop on the beat, all would be well.\n7The problem is not technology.\nTechnology can help, but the challenge is one of policy, not hardware.\nIn fact, the heart of the issue is how intelligence does its business.\nExisting business practices, with each intelligence agency controllingthe information it produces, make it dif\ufb01cult to share across U.S. intel-ligence, let alone getting information to state and local authorities.The core of the policy problem begins with intelligence, with exist-ing security procedures designed to limit information to those with a\u201cneed to know,\u201d not share it. Yet, fresh analytic insights are likely toarise precisely from those who come to the information with a freshperspective, who have noneed to know. The fundamental challenge is\nin reshaping how the U.S. government thinks of information and howinformation should be used and controlled.\nThe latest season of inquiry, unusual in the last half-century, has\nbeen more about intelligence\u2019s analysts than its operators.\n8From the\nBay of Pigs in the 1960s to the Iran\u2013Contra Affair in the 1980s, the cus-tomary focus of allegations of failure was bungled covert operations,not analysis (not that today\u2019s analysts have relished their season!).Achieving signi\ufb01cant results with small secret projects became in-creasingly unlikely between the 1950s and the 1990s. Early targets of\nIntroduction 13\nU.S. covert action sought and almost pleaded not to be regarded asenemies of the United States. However, for Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinistas orIran\u2019s Khomeini \u2013 not to mention Al Qaeda\u2019s bin Laden \u2013 the UnitedStates was more useful as an enemy than as a friend. Cuba\u2019s Castrobridged the two periods, with America-as-foe becoming the best thinghe had going for him. As the scale of operations grew, so did the likeli-hood that they would become public. They become \u201covert covert\u201d; inthe most visible example, U.S. support to the mujahideen contesting\nSoviet occupation of Afghanistan after 1979 was a very open secret,one entailing a half billion dollars a year.\nIf covert action cannot be kept secret, then why not do it openly? In\nthe past two decades, that question came to acquire a \u201cyes\u201d answer \u2013the biggest change in \u201ccovert\u201d action and the theme of Chapter 8. TheUnited States, operating through its own aid agencies and throughthe government-funded National Endowment for Democracy (NED),provided aid to democratic groups and processes around the world,and it had lots of company from other countries and from non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Indeed, the operation that ledto Slobodan Milosevic\u2019s fall from power in Serbia in 2000 was almosta carbon copy, accomplished overtly, of what the United States earlierhad accomplished covertly (e.g., in Chile).\nThe other major change is more recent, driven by the age of terror;\nthe jury is still out. CIA covert operators and military Special Opera-tions Forces have been thrown together. In Afghanistan and later inIraq, the results were impressive, and the operations were secret onlyin their tactical details. More broadly, however, these developmentsraise thorny questions of authorization and accountability. When theCIA acts, it requires a presidential \u201c\ufb01nding\u201d sent to Congress; yet, themilitary can be authorized simply through the chain of command fromthe president as commander in chief.\nLike it or not, intelligence in democracies is becoming more the\nsubject of political debate, which is the proposition at the core ofChapter 9. For the United States, that partly re\ufb02ects the passion sur-rounding issues at the edge of intelligence, such as torture. However,it also re\ufb02ects changes as the center of intelligence\u2019s business: thechange in targets and the consequent need to expand surveillanceat home. That, too, is driving the debate as its stretches democratic\n14 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\noversight of intelligence \u2013 attested to by controversies over the bound-aries of SIGINT collected at home in countries from the United Statesto Sweden.\nFor oversight as well, the Cold War solutions may no longer suf\ufb01ce.\nAfter the investigations of the 1970s, the U.S. Congress passed theForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to provide judicial over-sight of domestic surveillance for national-security rather than lawenforcement purposes. A secret court reviewed applications from theJustice Department and the FBI. However, after September 11, theBush administration argued that it could not target named individualswith speci\ufb01c warrants before the fact; rather, it needed to scan wideswathes of communication, searching for connections of interest. Itmay be that oversight will have to move from judicial approval beforethe fact to some form of continuing legal or congressional review assurveillance proceeds.\nThe change in intelligence\u2019s targets also raises ethical issues that\nslide into prudential questions in a democracy. These are also illumi-nated by a comparative perspective, suggesting how different prac-tices and experiences are re\ufb02ections of the different national ways ofdealing with intelligence \u2013 which, in turn, re\ufb02ect different political cul-tures with different relationships between governments and peopleand different ways of de\ufb01ning power. In Europe, for instance, Britainand France still consider themselves as global powers and are quitedifferent from countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, whichdo not.\nThe campaign against terrorism is not only mixing military force\nand intelligence in new ways; it also is straining the limits of both \u2013from the limits of preemption to the use of covert action away fromthe battle\ufb01eld. Intelligence is expanding dramatically in both expenseand breadth of activity, some of which is controversial, especially athome. At the same time that intelligence is seeking and being givennew powers, technology is providing new opportunities to survey largequantities of information about individuals. The irony is that intelli-gence will be more effective the less terrorists understand of its scopeand methods \u2013 which constrains the scope of the public debate butcannot be allowed to constrain it too much.\n2\nThe Changed Target\nThe change in targets for intelligence is dramatic. To be sure, for allthe emphasis on terrorists and other nonstate (or transnational) tar-gets, the change is hardly absolute. Intelligence dealt with nonstatesbefore, and nation-states \u2013 such as North Korea, Iran, and China \u2013still loom large in the work of U.S. intelligence. While some of thosestate targets, such as North Korea, are familiar in the sense that theyresemble the secretive Soviet Union, others present different andunfamiliar \u2013 if not entirely new \u2013 challenges.\nThis chapter de\ufb01nes the change in targets, focusing on transna-\ntional targets such as terrorists. The change is widely acknowledged,yet its implications run far deeper than are usually recognized. Thechange goes to the heart of how intelligence does its business \u2013 fromcollection to analysis to dissemination, to use the labels that areincreasingly less apt. Before turning to transnational targets, somediscussion of remaining state targets is appropriate because those alsocover a range. The chapter then details the challenges of transnationaltargets, concluding by illustrating some of the implications of thatchange with the issue of possible acquisition of WMD by terrorists.\nthe range of state targets\nStates will not only remain targets for intelligence; they will alsoremain, for all the competition from transnational actors \u2013 rangingfrom NGOs to international business, to drug lords and terrorists \u2013the key actors in the international system. Thus, they will remainan important target for intelligence. Those state targets also cover a\n15\n16 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 2.1. Range of State Targets\nClosed Mixed Open\nSoviet Union then,North Korea nowChina, Iran now U.S. allies; much of the\nworld\nBasic data oncapabilities secret:focus on puzzlesPuzzles about capabilitiesremain; mysteriesimportant tooMost capabilitiestransparent; mysteriescritical\nSecret sourcesdominatecollection; toolittle informationSecret sources valuable;open sources as wellSecrets less valuable; toomuch information is aproblem\nrange, roughly from closed to open. In fact, the range is a continuum,and Table 2.1 identi\ufb01es three positions of interest along that contin-uum: closed, mixed, and open. To be sure, even the most open stateskeep some secrets, a reminder that openness is relative. The secretskept by otherwise open societies \u2013 for instance, \u201cWhat capabilities andplans does Israel have for military strikes on nuclear facilities in itsneighborhood?\u201d \u2013 drive intelligence leftward in Table 2.1. For thosequestions, information is in short supply, and secret sources becomemore important.\nQuestions about states came and come with considerable shape.\nStates are geographic; they come with an address. As important, theycome with considerable \u201cstory\u201d attached. I have realized that, ulti-mately, intelligence is storytelling. It is helping those who will takeaction construct and adjust the stories in their head that will guidetheir decisions. Absent some story, new information about a topic isjust a factoid. The story provides a pigeonhole and context for thenew information. To be sure, if the story in their head becomes toohardened, too impervious to adjustment in light of new information,the new information may simply be discarded if it does not conformto the story. This is also called mindset or \u201cgroupthink\u201d and it is theroot of most of what are called intelligence failures, which is a majorsubject of Chapter 6.\nWe know what states are like, even those states as different from\nthe United States as the Soviet Union \u2013 or North Korea: they are hier-archical and bureaucratic. Because their purposes are broadly sim-ilar \u2013 that is, protecting and seeking to assure decent living conditions\nThe Changed Target 17\nfor (at least some of) their citizens \u2013 their internal institutions sharesimilarities. The devil may be in the details, for instance, in under-standing the differences in the workings and in\ufb02uence of the JapaneseDiet by comparison to the U.S. Congress, but at least \u201clegislature\u201dprovides a shared starting point for the discussion. As a result, thefact that states come with stories attached not only facilitates the taskof analyzing them, it also \u201cgreases\u201d the conversation between intelli-gence and policy about the results of that analysis.\nMost intelligence questions about states fell and fall into the fre-\nquently used distinction between puzzles and mysteries. Puzzles are\nquestions that could be answered with certainty if only with accessto information that, in principle, is available. Dave Snowden, in hisbusiness-related writing about the philosophy of information, callsthem known problems, for which there is a unique relationship\nbetween causes and effects.\n1The challenge is to correctly categorize\nthe problem, obtain the necessary data to solve it, and apply acceptedformulas. Military-targeting issues are puzzles; so are many issuesabout a state\u2019s capabilities: \u201cHow many nuclear devices does NorthKorea have?\u201d\nMuch of Cold War intelligence was puzzle-solving \u2013 that is, looking\nfor additional pieces to \ufb01ll out a mosaic of understanding whose broadshape was a given. Because so much that was open about the UnitedStates and other democracies was secret about the Soviet Union \u2013basic economic and military statistics, for instance \u2013 the United Statesand its allies spent billions of dollars on exotic collection systems tosolve those puzzles.\nBecause those puzzles were secret, by de\ufb01nition, solving them\nrelied heavily on secret intelligence sources: espionage (HUMINT)and what came to be called \u201ctechnical collection\u201d by \u201cnational tech-nical means\u201d \u2013 primarily satellites taking pictures and other imagery(IMINT), or satellites, ground stations, and other platforms intercept-ing signals from those states (SIGINT).\nThose secret sources, especially HUMINT, were nicely matched to\npuzzle-solving. HUMINT, by nature, is a target-of-opportunity busi-ness. Spies in place may not be invited to a critical decision meetingor they may attend but not be able to get the information to their han-dler quickly lest their cover be blown. As a result, spies may or maynot be able to provide useful information about fast-moving plans or\n18 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nintentions. For most puzzles, however, the puzzle piece that is notavailable today will still be welcome tomorrow. Therefore, if a spycannot steal that secret puzzle piece today, the piece will still be valu-able if it can be transmitted tomorrow. The result is an apparent para-dox: while spying is often conceived of as a means of obtaining aninside look at an adversary\u2019s intentions (and sometimes is), it is morereliably valuable at solving puzzles. It is little surprise, then, that mostespionage targets are puzzles: military plans, weapons designs, andindustrial processes.\nIn contrast to puzzles, no evidence can de\ufb01nitively solve mysteries\nbecause, typically, they are about people, not things. They are contin-gent. Snowden labels these knowable problems, which involve contin-\ngent relationships between a limited set of causes and effects. In thisrealm, analytic techniques can be used to predict outcomes, at leastprobabilistically. We cannot know the answer, but we can know \u2013in the case of intelligence, usually from recent history and perhapssome theory \u2013 which factors are important to monitor and somethingof how they interact to produce the answer. Russia\u2019s in\ufb02ation rate forthis year is a mystery; so is whether Israel might strike Iranian nuclearfacilities. While Soviet capabilities were treated primarily as a puz-zle, those of terrorist groups are a mystery because they depend untilthe very last moment on the actions and vulnerabilities of their foes \u2013more on that later.\nFor puzzles, the product is theanswer: North Korea has Xnuclear\nweapons; Soviet missiles have Ywarheads. To be sure, the answer may\nnot be de\ufb01nitive; it may remain a best estimate. If this is true, how-ever, it is not because of inherent uncertainty. Rather, it is becauseinformation available in principle is unavailable in fact. The answer isas close as we can come with the information at hand. The infamousOctober 2002 NIE about whether Iraq had WMD sought to solve apuzzle: Iraq either had or did not have WMD programs, with rele-vant proscribed materials to match. The NIE was rightly criticized ona number of grounds, which are discussed in Chapter 7. Yet, althoughits answer \u2013 a resounding \u201cYes, Saddam has them\u201d \u2013 was dead wrong,in fact, it was probably the only answer that could have been offeredgiven the evidence and argument at hand.\n2\nFor mysteries, the product is a best forecast, perhaps in the form of\na probability with key factors identi\ufb01ed as well as how they bear on\nThe Changed Target 19\nthe estimate. If analysts do not and cannot know what Russia\u2019s in\ufb02a-tion rate will be this year, they do know \u2013 from Russia\u2019s experienceas well as that of other countries \u2013 which factors will be important indetermining that rate and, at least roughly, how they will combine toproduce it. So, the answer can be conveyed by laying out those deter-minants along with quantitative or qualitative assessments of wherethey stand and how they are moving. Doing so can lead to a bestforecast, along with some bounds of uncertainty. To sharpen both theforecast and the bounds, sensitivity analyses (e.g., using scenarios ora variety of quantitative methods) could test the effects of differentlevels of determinants on outcomes.\nMost of the states at the closed end of the continuum are steeply\nhierarchical, led by small Leninist Party cadres or individuals. Forthem, preserving the leadership\u2019s position \u2013 also known as regime sur-\nvival \u2013 is paramount. In principle, such states could be more nimble\nand thus more unpredictable than more open states with more delib-erative and thus cumbersome processes of governance. However, thisassumes that the authoritarian leaders could bring their cadres \u2013 and,to the extent it matters, their people \u2013 with them in sharp changes ofcourse. Rather, the inertia in such systems is often underappreciated.The most dramatic change of course that the Soviet Union made wasto collapse \u2013 hardly what Mikhail Gorbachev intended.\n3The North\nKorean leader, Kim Jong-il, performed a nifty tap dance in keepingthe international community off guard about his nuclear intentions,but it was a tap dance on a very small dance \ufb02oor.\nTwo of the states of most interest in the mixed category raise the\nimportance of story \u2013 or its absence \u2013 in somewhat similar ways.For Iran, the overarching U.S. story is unremitting hostility towardthat country\u2019s theocratic leadership, hostility that dates back to thetakeover of the U.S. embassy in 1979. Pure enmity hardly makes forempathy; instead, it makes it too easy to turn foes into caricaturesof pure evil. That is what occurred with Iran under the AyatollahKhomeini, and it occurred with Al Qaeda after the attacks of Septem-ber 11, 2001. Serious efforts to understand the foe almost becamepolitically incorrect for American society if not for its intelligence.Iran\u2019s president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, was frequently portrayedas a madman in popular commentaries. His 2005 statement, which was\ufb01rst translated as \u201cthe occupying regime [in Israel] must be wiped off\n20 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthe map,\u201d immediately became characterized as a call to destroy thestate of Israel, if not a call to genocide.\n4\nFrom this perspective, Ahmadinejad may have been his own\nworst enemy. However, the more signi\ufb01cant point is that the UnitedStates was slow to try to understand Iran on its own terms. In fact,Ahmadinejad, whose title was \u201cpresident,\u201d actually was not that pow-erful. He was less like a president in American terms and more like aFrench prime minister, whose writ did not run far beyond administer-ing the government\u2019s budget and overseeing its civil service. In addi-tion, because the United States had so constricted its connections \u2013 ofboth government and private business \u2013 into Iran, it had little where-withal for understanding the country even if it was moved to try. Asin other cases of \u00b4emigr \u00b4e populations in the United States, the counter-\npart of too little contact with Iranians in Iran may have been too muchin\ufb02uence from \u00b4emigr \u00b4e Iranians in the United States \u2013 thus injecting\ninto the national discussion the combination of enmity and wishfulthinking characteristic of those who feel exiled from their homeland.\nThe dif\ufb01culty was compounded because although Iran remained a\nstate, it was a theocratic state and thus a new creature for twentieth-and twenty-\ufb01rst\u2013century Americans, inside and outside intelligence.We have no story about such governments. For example, the fusion ofchurch and state, rather than their separation, provides an unfamiliarcontext for parsing the relationship between Ahmadinejad, the coun-try\u2019s titular president, and its supreme leader, a cleric. As a result,the United States \ufb01rst exaggerated Ahmadinejad\u2019s importance andthen insulted him when he visited the United Nations in New Yorkin 2007. The lack of story made it all but impossible to fathom theevidence that many younger Iranians seemed to be among the mostpro-American people in the world. Lacking context, it was easy forAmericans to be tempted to believe regime change was around thecorner.\nFor China, too, there was and is no story. How are we to understand\n\u201cLeninist capitalism\u201d: booming, frontier capitalism presided over bya tight Communist Party? The combination seems one that cannotendure. China\u2019s future is a mystery. China\u2019s communist leaders mayhave a vision, even a plan for that future, but whether that plan isimplemented in anything like the form they now intend will depend onthousands of bumps, small and large, in the road along the way. The\nThe Changed Target 21\nplan will be adjusted \u2013 or thrown entirely off course. All intelligencecan do in the present is frame that mystery of China\u2019s future in a waythat helps to see America\u2019s interest more clearly and perhaps providemore steadiness to policy along the way, as the twists and turns inChina\u2019s course sometimes befuddle and sometimes anger Americans.\nIf parsing the theocratic state of Iran is a new challenge for Ameri-\ncans, framing the China mystery was and is especially sharp because itis a mystery that the United States has not confronted in a long time.China is both a possible military competitor and an economic part-\nner of the United States. This is a combination we have not seen ina long time. Perhaps pre\u2013World War II Germany is the most recentkindred mystery, combining economic interest and military concern,but it paled in economic importance then by comparison to Chinanow. Moreover, from the time Hitler took power, the meaning ofGermany\u2019s military growth became increasingly less mysterious; thatGermany\u2019s rising power would pose a threat to U.S. interests becameincreasingly plain.\nNot so for China. Taiwan remains a major \ufb02ashpoint and driver\nof Chinese military planning. In other respects, however, China\u2019s mil-itary rise is simply the by-product of its economic growth. WhetherChina will become a military competitor of the United States only onpaper or whether its military power will become a threat remains tobe seen. That, too, is a mystery, one wrapped within the larger Chinamystery. Therefore, it is not surprising that U.S. discussion of Chinaveers sharply between competitor and partner. Indeed, listening toconversations about China in Washington and Los Angeles makesone wonder whether the same country is being discussed! In Washing-ton, the language is of military and competitor, while in Los Angeles,it is of economic and partner, the need to be there.\nlooking at transnational issues: how are they different?\nAs an intelligence challenge, transnational targets such as terroristsdiffer from traditional state targets in a number of ways. Table 2.2elaborates on those differences.\nTransnational targets are not new for intelligence, for it has long\nbeen active against organized crime and drug traf\ufb01ckers. What is\nnew is twofold: (1) the importance of transnational threats, especially\n22 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 2.2.

In the past, organized crime and drug traf\ufb01ckers werea secondary activity for intelligence; now, some of the transnationalthreats, such as terrorism, are the primary activity.\nMoreover, the range of current and prospective transnational tar-\ngets is broad. If \u201cthreat\u201d is conceived broadly, then threats can bethought of as covering a range. At one end are those threats that come\nwith threateners attached, people who mean us harm.\n5At the other\nend are developments that can be thought of as threats without threat-\neners. If they are a threat, the threat results from the cumulative effect\nThe Changed Target 23\nPurposive\nThreats\nDrug\ntraffickersOrganized\ncrime\nTerroristsPestilence\u201cThreats\nwithout\nThreateners\u201dCyber\n\u201cattacks\u201d\nFigure 2.1. From purposive threats to \u201cthreats without threateners.\u201d\nof actions taken for other reasons, not from an intent that is purposiveand hostile. They might also be called systemic threats. Those who\nburn the Amazon rain forests or try to migrate here or spread pan-demics here do not necessarily wish Americans harm; they simplywant to survive or get rich. Their self-interest becomes a threat to us.\nFigure 2.1 displays the continuum.\nIt is interesting that the main transnational targets for intelligence\nin the past \u2013 organized crime and drug traf\ufb01ckers \u2013 fell somewhere inthe middle of that continuum. The activities of both created national-security concerns, but the danger the traf\ufb01ckers posed to the nationwas a by-product of their main purpose, which was to enrich them-selves. Also in the middle of that continuum, energy imports arecommerce, but the products are so crucial to national economies asto invoke security concerns \u2013 sometimes stunningly misposed. Thoseconcerns have waxed and waned with price and supply, and they havebeen recon\ufb01gured recently not only by much higher prices but alsoby the resulting new winners and new losers and by the changes in thenature of global energy trade. Moreover, as both trade and investmentbecome global, economic transactions driven by commerce \u2013 with nothreat intended \u2013 may come to look menacing, as it was recently withChina\u2019s proposed purchase of UNOCAL or with a Dubai-based com-pany\u2019s interest in taking over U.S. ports.\nWhat is striking now is that the ends of the continuum are more\nimportant; they are primary, not secondary. At the \u201cthey-mean-us-harm\u201d end, terrorism by Islamic extremists does not pose the existen-tial threat to the United States that the Soviet Union and its nuclearweapons did, but it is more than an inconvenience \u2013 and it frightens\n24 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nAmericans well beyond its actual harm so far. For instance, imme-diately after the September 11 attacks, polls asking how concernedrespondents were about more terrorist attacks in the United Statesrecorded 49 percent as worrying a \u201cgreat deal\u201d and 38 percent worry-ing \u201csomewhat.\u201d Two years later, those concerned a \u201cgreat deal\u201d hadfallen to 25 percent but those \u201csomewhat\u201d concerned had increasedto 46 percent.\n6\nIn fact, the loss of life on September 11 was off the charts of Amer-\nicans\u2019 historical experience with terrorism. In the \ufb01ve years after 2001,the annual numbers of fatalities of Americans from terrorism, world-wide, were all less than 100 \u2013 and typically barely into double dig-its. The total for 2005 was \ufb01fty-six, which may have resulted as muchfrom a change in counting rules as from an actual increase in fatali-ties.\n7That total compares with an average during the same \ufb01ve years\nof 62 people killed annually by lightning, 63 from tornadoes, 692 inbicycle accidents, and an incredible 41,616 in motor-vehicle\u2013relatedaccidents.\nOne reason for the fear is that people \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to deal with\nlow-probability occurrences, especially those with devastating conse-quences. A generation ago, researchers compared the assessments ofexperts on nuclear power with those of nonspecialist citizens. Twogroups of citizens ranked the risk posed by nuclear power as num-ber one in a list of thirty activities and technologies; the third groupranked it number eight. By contrast, the experts ranked it numbertwenty.\n8For nuclear weapons and nuclear war, the gap was even\nwider. The citizens may have been right and the experts wrong \u2013fortunately, we had no proof during the Cold War for nuclearweapons. Working every day on the issue may have desensitized theexperts or they may have reduced their own cognitive dissonance bysubconsciously downgrading their own assessments of the risk. In anyevent, the difference was striking; on issues such as nuclear power,in which evidence is available, the experts\u2019 views tended to correlatewith the evidence (e.g., numbers of fatalities).\nWhen I spoke about the terrorist threat, especially in the \ufb01rst years\nafter 2001, I was often asked what people could do to protect theirfamily and home. I usually responded by giving the analyst\u2019s answer,what I labeled \u201cthe RAND answer.\u201d Anyone\u2019s probability of beingkilled by a terrorist today was essentially zero and would be the same\nThe Changed Target 25\ntomorrow, barring a major discontinuity. So, they should do nothing.It is not surprising that the answer was hardly satisfying, and I didnot regard it as such. I came to realize what studies of other risksindicated, that terrorism is especially frightening because it seems ran-dom.\n9We have the sense that we can do something about other things\nthat might kill: we can diet, or not smoke, or drink less alcohol. Thesense is partly illusion, but terrorism seems entirely random. How-ever, it is not random \u2013 choosing to live outside of major cities wouldreduce a person\u2019s already vanishingly low probability of being killedby a terrorist \u2013 but so it seems.\n10\nAt the other end of the continuum, global warming seems increas-\ningly serious as a global threat \u2013 if not directly to the United States,then to countries and regions in whose stability the United States hasimportant stakes. (Global pandemics are a direct threat to the UnitedStates.) Like terrorism, global warming runs beyond the mystery cat-egory because we are not sure of the factors that produce it or, espe-cially, how they combine. Moreover, effects may cascade in discontin-uous ways. Like bridges that are not maintained, there may be littlevisible effect for years, but all of a sudden there is a catastrophic effect.The best that intelligence can do may be to provide \u201cif\u2013then\u201d assess-ments; for example, if warming has given physical effects in particu-lar places, then it will exacerbate given sources of social and politicaltension.\n11\nThe changed threat also requires more seamless connections across\nwhat had been thought of as separate disciplines: early warning andcrisis management. Crime and drug traf\ufb01cking are clearly located inthe middle of the threat spectrum. What is striking, however, about apestilence that appears in the United States is that it might be eithera purposive terrorist tactic or an \u201cinnocent\u201d contagion due to greaterglobal connectedness and the multiplicity of previously unknownpathogens. A cyber \u201cattack\u201d might be a determined attack by a hos-tile group or \u201csimply\u201d a set of smart young people seeing how far theycan go.\nThe difference is not likely to be immediately clear, which is why\nboth disease and cyber attacks are shown in Figure 2.1 with a dot-ted line, indicating that better situation awareness might take themquickly from the \u201cthey-mean-us-no-harm\u201d category to the purposive-threateners\u2019 category. Or, the \u201ccrisis\u201d might arise rapidly and at home\n26 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nif, for instance, a local newspaper published pictures of the Koranbeing desecrated.\nObjects of Scrutiny\nTo overstate for effect, the targets of Cold War intelligence werebig, rich, and central. That is, the overarching concern about theSoviet Union was the Red Army: \u201cHow big and sophisticated a forcecould the Soviet economy sustain?\u201d When the Cold War froze intostalemate in Europe, to be sure, other more peripheral parts of theworld became more important in the East\u2013West competition: witnessAngola, Afghanistan, or especially Vietnam. However, Europe re-mained the main game and the main prize. Intelligence was also inter-ested in individuals during the Cold War, but they were mostly easilyidenti\ufb01ed: the leaders of major governments or factions.\nNow, by contrast, many of the objects of scrutiny for intelligence\nare small, poor, and peripheral. In an age of terror, a single individualor small group can do enormous damage; the September 11 hijack-ers proved that decisively. In the era of the Worldwide Web, a singleFrench banker can also do enormous damage, although fortunatelyhis damage was mere money. The bank trader lost Soci \u00b4et\u00b4eG\u00b4en\u00b4erale\nmore than $7 billion before being discovered in early 2008, makingvery risky and very large bets while covering them with his under-standing of the \u201cseams\u201d in the bank\u2019s oversight system. These smallobjects of scrutiny do not identify themselves; rather, they may ariseunpredictably. Many (but not all) of the September 11 hijackers hadbeen on the radar screens of U.S. or other intelligence; later, however,homegrown would-be terrorists in Britain came as more of a surprise.\nSimilarly, the places to which intelligence has to turn its scrutiny\nhave changed. Many of them are poor and peripheral, such asAfghanistan. We now know enough about terrorists to know that theyare not generally poor, but we also know that poor countries are notonly fertile ground for recruiting terrorists but also can be co-optedby terrorist groups as bases and safe havens. After the fall of theSoviet Union, if U.S. interest in peripheral places was mostly discre-tionary, driven by simple suffering or the interests of allies, it is nolonger. The U.S. government and its intelligence agencies need to pay\nThe Changed Target 27\nattention to poor, peripheral places that might be part of the threat ofterrorism.\nNo \u201cStory\u201d\nAlthough state targets of intelligence will remain \u2013 Iran, NorthKorea, China, and Russia, for example \u2013 the shift to terrorists andother transnational developments as primary targets is momentous.If states \u2013 even states very different than the United States \u2013 camewith some \u201cstory\u201d attached, transnational targets, especially terroristgroups, do not. These new targets deprive intelligence and policy of ashared story that would facilitate analysis and communication. If weknew that states were geographical, hierarchical, and bureaucratic,there is no comparable story for nonstates, which come in many sizesand shapes.\nAl Qaeda is an example: more than \ufb01ve years after September 11,\nit was unclear whether the organization was a hierarchy, a network, aterrorism venture capitalist, or an ideological inspiration. There is nodoubt that it contained elements of all four, as well as other character-istics in different measures, but that hardly amounted to a story. As aresult, interpreting additional information as well as communicatingthose assessments was dif\ufb01cult. The \u201chierarchy\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d viewsmade it dif\ufb01cult to conceptualize the March 2004 Madrid bombers,who seemed to have little to do with Al Qaeda \u201cCentral.\u201d In turn,once the \u201cinspiration\u201d view of Al Qaeda became accepted, it madefor very different interpretations of the extent to which Al QaedaCentral had been able to reconstitute itself \ufb01ve years and moreafter September 11.\nDisease has some story attached. We know what diseases are and\nsomething about how they spread \u2013 for example, smallpox. Yet, for allwe know, a smallpox outbreak in the United States could be either apurposive terrorist tactic from a group that obtained the few remain-ing smallpox pathogens or an \u201cinnocent\u201d contagion due to greaterglobal connectedness and the possible leak of previously unknownpathogens. As with problems of cyber security, the difference is by nomeans likely to be clear. Today, an opponent can wage a \u201cwar with-out \ufb01ngerprints\u201d; as a result, not only might it be unknown who is\n28 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nattacking but also that we are being attacked in the \ufb01rst place. Talkabout the absence of story!\nLocation of the Target\nTransnational targets not only come without a story, by de\ufb01nition,they also come without an address. They are, after all, transnational:they are both \u201cover there\u201d (abroad) and \u201chere\u201d (at home). By con-trast, although early in the Cold War the United States worried aboutcommunists at home (some of the abuses stemming from that concernare discussed in Chapter 3), for the most part, the intelligence chal-lenge of communism could be divided into foreign intelligence abroadand counterintelligence at home. The task at home was mostly track-ing white-collar spymasters from the communist countries as theytried to recruit spies in the United States. Dividing the task in thatway enabled the distinctions, or \u201coppositions,\u201d that are the subject ofChapter 3: intelligence versus law enforcement, foreign versus domes-tic, public versus private. Those distinctions were re\ufb02ected in organi-zations and their operating concepts. They made great sense duringthe Cold War, especially in safeguarding American civil liberties.However, transnational threats, especially terrorists, respect none ofthe distinctions. The oppositions set up the country to fail on Sep-tember 11, which is the starting point of Chapter 3.\nThe fact that transnational targets are \u201chere\u201d as well as \u201cover\nthere\u201d impels nations to reconsider what has been regarded as domes-tic intelligence. Not only do they face the necessity of collecting moreinformation about their citizens and residents \u2013 and doing so with min-imal damage to civil liberties \u2013 they also need to rethink the bound-aries that the distinctions established. Terrorists are criminals but maycommit only one crime, and then it will be too late. Terrorist groupshave much in common with international crime organizations exceptfor one critical difference: criminals want to live to steal another day;they are not candidates for suicide bombers.\nMore, and More Diverse, Consumers\nNot only did consumers during the Cold War share with intelligence astory about states \u2013 territorial and usually hierarchical, with histories,\nThe Changed Target 29\ntraditions, bureaucracies, and standard operating procedures \u2013 theyalso were relatively few in number. Most consumers were located atthe apex of the national-security decision-making establishments andmost were political\u2013military of\ufb01cials. Busy and distracted, they werenot always an easy target for intelligence to serve. They were, how-ever, an identi\ufb01able and familiar target. When the Cold War ended,intelligence looked for new consumers and, at \ufb01rst, found them indomestic agencies such as the Department of Commerce, whichwanted staff work as much as intelligence analysis.\nThen, after the attacks of September 11, intelligence\u2019s consumers\nmushroomed, this time including state and local of\ufb01cials and privatemanagers of infrastructure. Transnational issues thus involve amuch wider variety of consumers, extending to agencies outside thetraditional national-security establishment and outside the federalgovernment. There are eighteen thousand relevant government juris-dictions at the state and local levels in the United States, consistingof more than 600,000 police of\ufb01cers; nationwide, there are threetimes as many private-security as public police of\ufb01cers. Virtuallynone of them have security clearances to see any classi\ufb01ed federalinformation, much less the secret compartmented intelligence (SCI)that is intelligence\u2019s preeminent stock-in-trade. Both the FBI and theDHS have made efforts since September 11 to clear state and localof\ufb01cials, but the numbers \u2013 although signi\ufb01cant \u2013 remain small. TheFBI has provided clearances to approximately two thousand stateand local of\ufb01cials per year, mostly at the secret level.\n12\nThe lack of a story for transnational targets such as terrorists, or\nthe presence of tentative, competing stories about them often basedonly on short histories, is also compounded by the different organiza-tional cultures involved. As discussed in Chapter 3, traditional intelli-gence and law enforcement are different enterprises. Even the mean-ing of intelligence differs between the two. State and local of\ufb01cials are\nunfamiliar with the products of national-intelligence agencies and areprone to imagine (or hope) that there is magic behind the green doorof classi\ufb01cation, if only the feds will open it.\nMoreover, who is the \u201ckey\u201d consumer is far less clear. An airport\nsecurity of\ufb01cer or a public health doctor may have a more urgent\u201cneed to know\u201d about a threat than the president of the United Statesbecause he or she may be in a more immediate position to thwart it.\n30 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nAt the same time, most new transnational consumers have little famil-iarity with intelligence and how to interpret it. For this reason too, thechallenge of connecting with the consumer is greater in the transna-tional than in the state-to-state arena.\nLess \u201cBounded\u201d\nStates, for the most part, are clearly \u201cdelineated,\u201d having known bor-ders and capitals and doing much that is openly observable. More-over, states act within the context of formal and customary rules (e.g.,established military doctrines), which gives predictability to many oftheir actions. By contrast, transnational actors are amorphous, \ufb02uid,and hidden, presenting intelligence with major challenges simply indescribing their structures and boundaries. Because such actors arealso far less constrained by formal rules than their state counterparts,they can engage in a wider variety of tactics on a regular basis, addingimmensely to the challenge of forecasting their behavior.\nThe relative lack of constraints is obvious in the case of the Islamic\nextremist terrorists. It is also the case for organized crime and drugtraf\ufb01cking, actions that by de\ufb01nition put their perpetrators on theother side of the law. The political scientist, James Rosenau, referredto the transnational actors as \u201csovereignty-free.\u201d\n13For him, they con-\nfront an \u201cautonomy dilemma\u201d parallel to the \u201csecurity dilemma\u201d thatstates face. Yet, free of sovereignty, transnational actors are also freeof many of the obligations and constraints of sovereign states. Eventhe transnational actors that most of us are likely to label \u201cgood\u201d maybe in a position to buy considerable freedom of action, for better orworse. Indeed, the scale of some private activities literally outstripsgovernment: the approximately $800 million that the Bill and MelindaGates Foundation contributes every year for global health approachesthe annual budget of the World Health Organization and is compara-ble to the funds given to \ufb01ght infectious disease by the U.S. Agencyfor International Development.\nWhile the current Islamic extremist terrorists hardly act quickly\nbut instead carefully plan their attacks over years, transnational tar-gets as well are in another sense less bounded than state-centric tar-gets. There will be discontinuities in targets and attack modes, andnew groups will emerge unpredictably. Intelligence had a decade to\nThe Changed Target 31\nexplore the impact of Gorbachev\u2019s accession on the Soviet system;however, in the case of Al Qaeda, for example, events unfolded at astunning pace after September 11, 2001.\nMoreover, the transnational arena involves networked actors sub-\nject to what students of the emerging science of networks refer toas \u201ccascades,\u201d making them more vulnerable to sudden change thanstate-to-state systems. Some networks, such as electric power grids,are tightly coupled systems. Small changes within the network accu-mulate until the network reaches a \u201ctipping point,\u201d after which dra-matic domino-like sequences ensue, such as the collapse of the net-work \u2013 that is, the failure of the electric power grid. As an examplefrom beyond terrorism, in the Asian \ufb01nancial meltdown of 1997, arelatively small crisis involving the Thai currency quickly envelopedmuch of Asia as networked \ufb01nancial markets produced cascadingeffects.\n14\nBroader and Lower Quality Information Base\nGiven closed foes, Cold War intelligence gave pride of place tosecrets \u2013 that is, information gathered by human and technical meansthat intelligence owned. Terrorists are hardly open, but an avalancheof open data is relevant to them: witness the September 11 hijack-ers whose real addresses were available in California motor-vehiclerecords. During the Cold War, the problem was too little (good) infor-mation; now, it is too much (unreliable) information. Then, intelli-gence\u2019s secrets were deemed reliable; now, the plethora on the Web isa stew of fact, fancy, and disinformation.\nBecause of the unbounded and high-pro\ufb01le nature of transnational\nthreats, intelligence must wade through an ocean of information thatcontrasts sharply with the more limited information that was availableon closed societies such as the Soviet Union. Much of the informa-tion is, at best, of uncertain reliability. Moreover, when compared toa state with a long history, much less contextual information is avail-able that can be used to evaluate the reliability of new information.For these reasons, the problem of separating \u201csignals\u201d from \u201cnoise\u201d ismore acute in the transnational domain.\nThat lack of context \u2013 the lack, in other words, of a story \u2013 means\nthat information-gathering against terrorists necessarily involves\n32 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\n\u201cmining\u201d or other processing of large quantities of information. Afterthe September 11 attacks, with the names of the hijackers known, thegovernment could quickly pick up their trail through motor-vehiclerecords, addresses, credit cards, and the like. However, that was afterthe fact; before the fact, names of interest may yet be unknown orfollowing them is bedeviled by aliases or different transliterations ofthe same Arabic name.\nWhatever the legal debate over the NSA\u2019s post\u2013September 11 Ter-\nrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) \u2013 a debate discussed in Chapter 9 \u2013the program vividly illustrates the challenge of dealing with the pres-ence of a vast amount of information and the absence of much contextfor processing it.\n15In the wake of September 11, the U.S. government\nworried about new plots and new cells, but it had few speci\ufb01c leads.Rather, it trolled through large numbers of telephone calls, almost allinternational, where there was reason to believe one of the partici-pants had links to Al Qaeda \u2013 for instance, because a call came froma region of Afghanistan or Pakistan where Al Qaeda was thought tooperate.\nInteraction with the Target\nWhile various countries, especially the United States, hoped that theirpolicies would in\ufb02uence Moscow, intelligence agencies could presumethat as a \ufb01rst approximation, those efforts at in\ufb02uence would fail;recall Harold Brown\u2019s statement about the U.S.\u2013Soviet nuclear com-petition: the Soviet Union would do what it would do. The challenge,in the \ufb01rst instance, was \ufb01guring out its likely course, not calibratingin\ufb02uence that other nations might have over that course.\nThe terrorist target, however, is utterly different. It is the ultimate\nasymmetric threat, shaping its capabilities to our vulnerabilities. TheSeptember 11 suicide bombers did not come up with their attackplan because they were airline buffs. They had done enough tacticalreconnaissance to know that fuel-\ufb01lled jets in \ufb02ight were a vulnerableasset and that defensive passenger-clearance procedures were weak.They could get box-cutters through airport security, and the schemeobviated the need to face a more effective defense against procur-ing or importing ordnance. Similarly, the London, Madrid, and otherbombers did enough tactical reconnaissance to shape their plans tothe vulnerabilities of their targets.\nThe Changed Target 33\nTo a great extent, we shape the threat to us; it re\ufb02ects our vulner-\nable assets and weak defenses. In that sense, the capabilities of ter-rorists are a mystery, not a puzzle, because those capabilities dependon their continuing adaptation to the vulnerabilities of their targets,not on counts of missiles, guns, or even cells. For instance, Al Qaeda\u2013linked plotters in 2006 planned to blow up airplanes over the Atlanticwith liquid explosives smuggled onto planes as sport drinks or otherpermitted carryons. They had adapted to the airport security proce-dures then in effect, knowing that drinks were permitted as carryonsand that most detectors in place could not identify explosives.\nAs military planners would describe it, it is impossible to under-\nstand red, potential foes without knowing a lot about blue, ourselves.In contrast to states such as the Soviet Union, transnational actorssuch as terrorists have a more intense relationship with the domi-nant actor in the international system, the United States. Their tacticsare often predicated on our policies and defensive measures, makingtheir behavior less determinate and predictable. Our understandingof transnational actors\u2019 proclivities will lead us to take actions that \u2013to a greater extent than would be the case with more structured, inter-nally driven state actors \u2013 will prompt adaptive behavior on their part.That process of adaptation can turn the predictions of intelligence into\u201cself-negating prophecies\u201d \u2013 and that is if the intelligence is suf\ufb01cientto make accurate predictions.\nThis interaction between \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d has awkward implica-\ntions for intelligence, especially foreign intelligence that has in manycountries been enjoined from examining the home front and, less for-mally, worried that getting too close to \u201cpolicy\u201d is to risk becom-ing politicized. The task for intelligence now cuts directly across theforeign\u2013domestic distinction. Moreover, to the extent that intelligencenow becomes the net assessment of red against blue, that too is some-thing that has been the province of the military, not civilian, agencies.\n\u201cSensemaking\u201d of \u201cComplexities\u201d\nTransnational targets involve both puzzles and mysteries, but theyalso invoke what might be thought of as mysteries-plus, what Snow-\nden calls \u201ccomplexities.\u201d Where Al Qaeda leaders hid out along thePakistan\u2013Afghanistan border was a puzzle, albeit one whose solutionmight have altered rapidly as the leaders shuttled among hideouts.\n34 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nWhen, where, and how Al Qaeda might attack the United States maybe thought of as a mystery. It can be so conceived to the extent thatwe believe we have some understanding of the nature of Al Qaedaand its links to af\ufb01liates, of its strategy, proclivities, and so on \u2013 to theextent, in other words, that there is now at least the beginnings of astory about Al Qaeda.\nYet, the mystery conception seems not quite apt as a way to frame\nthe challenge of understanding Islamic extremist terrorism and othertransnational targets. Because the terrorism comes with relatively lit-tle relevant history and context and because it is so unbounded, itinvolves a wide array of causes and effects that can interact in a varietyof contingent ways. Large numbers of relatively small actors respondto a shifting set of situational factors. Moreover, because interactionsre\ufb02ect unique circumstances, they do not necessarily repeat in anyestablished pattern and therefore are not amenable to predictive anal-ysis in the same way as mysteries. The September 11 terrorists in 2001and the Fort Dix plotters in 2006-7 both had connections to Al Qaeda;however, the links were very different, and the \ufb01rst did not provideany sense of pattern for the second.\n16\nTo be sure, the distinction between transnational and traditional\nintelligence problems should not be overstated: there are state-to-state problems, such as battle\ufb01eld situations or crisis diplomacy, inwhich situationally driven interactions among numerous players canalso produce a wide variety of outcomes.\nThese complexities in understanding transnational issues require\ncombinations of regional and functional expertise. In addressing puz-zles or even mysteries, a country\u2019s political or economic analysts oftencan work in relative isolation from analysts with other specializations,but that is not as much the case for terrorism and other transnationalissues. Assessing, for instance, the risk of dangerous weapons prolifer-ating across the globe draws on specialists in science and technology,illicit transfers, money laundering, politics, and network behavior \u2013 toname only a few \u2013 to track and comprehend the activities of weaponsnetworks. To a much greater extent than in traditional areas, transna-tional analysis is a team or even networked activity (because special-ists will be located in many agencies). This has potential bene\ufb01ts interms of avoiding mental biases (i.e., mixing different perspectives) aswell as potential risks in the form of groupthink and \u201clock-in.\u201d\nThe Changed Target 35\nThe challenge of dealing with complexities still lies ahead for the\nmost part. The goal is to convey a sense of emerging patterns with aneye to reinforcing or disrupting, respectively, positive or adverse pat-terns. Communicating that sense may be dif\ufb01cult in a discrete paperor stream of electrons. Rather, it may be best accomplished with theactive participation of policy of\ufb01cials \u2013 for instance, using computerpower to \ufb02y through a wide range of variables and scenarios, look-\ning for patterns.\n17Such processes run into two familiar obstacles:\n(1) the canonical separation of intelligence from policy; and (2) thefact that policy of\ufb01cials, in particular, are always hard-pressed fortime. Because the product is a sharpened sense, the problem is notone simply of communication; the sense needs to develop out ofshared analytical work.\nThe product is what might be called organizational sensemaking,\nas developed particularly by the noted organization theorist, KarlWeick.\n18Sensemaking is the process through which organizations \u2013\nnot individuals \u2013 comprehend the complex environment with whichthey must contend. It is a continuous, iterative, largely informal effortto understand, or \u201cmake sense,\u201d of what is going on in the externalenvironment that is relevant to the organization\u2019s goals and needs.In essence, it is the collective intuition of an organization. Throughconversations at all levels, organizations construct ongoing interpre-tations of reality by comparing new events to past patterns \u2013 or, in thecase of anomalies, by developing stories to account for them. Weickargued that the \ufb02uid sensemaking process has clear advantages as aframework for organizational action over \u201cdecision making\u201d becausethe latter often locks the organization into polishing and defendingformal decisions that may no longer be appropriate in fast-changingsituations.\nThe methodology for sensemaking \u2013 creating a uni\ufb01ed, explana-\ntory, consensual understanding about the world that leads to princi-pled, consistent action \u2013 requires forms of analysis and interactionswith consumers that are not yet developed, well known, or widelyused. Because it requires common understanding, it probably requiresa more interactive intelligence process than products; therefore, thereis a premium on ways to facilitate that interaction. After all, the realneed is not good analysis on a piece of paper; too often in intelli-gence, paper goods (or streams of electrons) are treated as ends in\n36 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthemselves. Rather, the need is for improved understanding by of\ufb01-cials who will decide or act (although that understanding may beginwith a piece of paper) and deeper research by teams of analysts.\nIt is dif\ufb01cult to spell out sensemaking in practice because it is not\nyet fully developed or implemented; it remains largely a theoreticalconstruct. However, let us return again to the questions of when,where, and how Al Qaeda and its kin might next strike the UnitedStates. Viewed from a sensemaking perspective, the challenge wouldentail a continuing conversation between intelligence and policy, aconversation conducted in the knowledge that the sensemaking pro-cess could fail (or succeed) dramatically at any moment. The conver-sation would be as informal as possible, aiming to sustain open-mind-edness about a wide variety of terrorist organizations and connections,motives, and attack modes. It would test new information againsta variety of hypotheses \u2013 in the absence of high con\ufb01dence aboutwhich factors mattered and how they were connected \u2013 and createnew ones as necessary. The product would be a sharpened sense forpossibilities and probabilities against the understanding that a highdegree of uncertainty was ineradicable. The WMD illustration later inthis chapter tries to sharpen the sense for sensemaking.\nImportance of Intelligence\nThe last major difference between transnational targets, especiallyterrorists, and state targets such as the Soviet Union may be the mostimportant. If prevention is the name of the game, the pressure on\nintelligence is extraordinary. In his 2002 national-security strategy,President Bush was speaking of Iraq but was graphic about the needto prevent attacks, by preemptive action if need be: \u201cWe must beprepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before theycan threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the UnitedStates and our allies and friends. ...T o f o r e s t a l l o r p r event such hos-\ntile acts by our adversaries, the United States will, if necessary, actpreemptively.\u201d\n19\nOr, as he stated more colorfully in his speech to the nation on\nMarch 19, 2002: \u201cWe will meet that threat now, with our Army, AirForce, Navy, Coast Guard, and Marines, so that we do not have tomeet it later with armies of \ufb01re \ufb01ghters and police and doctors on the\nThe Changed Target 37\nstreets of our cities.\u201d20He had foreshadowed the new strategy in his\nspeech at West Point in June 2002: \u201cBy confronting evil and lawlessregimes, we do not create a problem, we reveal a problem. And wewill lead the world in opposing it [sic].\u201d\n21\nIn contrast, the dominant strategy of the Cold War \u2013 deterrence \u2013\nwas not so sensitive to the speci\ufb01cs of intelligence. It rested on theassumption that for all its differences in goals and ideology, the SovietUnion was like us \u2013 modern, rational (in our terms), and not self-destructive. The strategy perceived Soviet intentions as hostile butrational. Thus, once Moscow had nuclear weapons, the way to ensurethat it did not use them was deterrence, which came to be associatedwith second-strike retaliation: as long as the United States (and itsallies) had the capacity to wreak unacceptable damage on the SovietUnion after a Soviet nuclear \ufb01rst strike, that \ufb01rst strike would nevercome and the promise of U.S. retaliation would never be tested.\nTwo of the four main themes of debate about Cold War deterrence\ndid not involve intelligence, and the one theme that did was highlytechnical. The \ufb01rst was: How much is enough? That is, how muchsecond-strike destruction would be enough to deter any Soviet \ufb01rststrike? The second was the question that animated U.S.\u2013Europeandiscussions during the Cold War: If NATO judged itself dangerouslyinferior to the Warsaw Pact in conventional forces along the centralfront in Europe, how could it credibly invoke some possibility of usingnuclear weapons \ufb01rst if a Pact conventional attack in Europe were suc-ceeding? Trying to answer that question sometimes led to torturousreasoning and tortured policy, but those policy issues did not muchdepend on intelligence.\n22\nThe logic of deterrence did raise one intelligence issue \u2013 a technical\nissue invoked by the awful, paradoxical aphorism about deterrence:offense is defense and defense is offense; killing people is good, killingweapons is bad. By this logic, if the Soviet Union had high con\ufb01dencethat it could defend against a retaliatory strike \u2013 by some combina-tion of killing U.S. missiles in a \ufb01rst strike and then killing the residualmissiles en route to the Soviet Union \u2013 it might be tempted by a \ufb01rststrike. The challenge for intelligence came down especially to assess-ing critical puzzles: \u201cHow many independent warheads did Moscowhave, with what accuracy, and thus how much of a threat did the SovietUnion pose to U.S. missile forces for retaliation?\u201d\n38 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThe fourth issue might have involved intelligence but for the most\npart did not. That issue was Soviet intentions and perceptions:\u201c H o w\nmuch risk of nuclear war was the Soviet leadership willing to take,and how much did it see the nuclear standoff in terms akin to those ofthe United States?\u201d To be sure, all of the issues were hotly debated,and intelligence bore on them. However, they were mysteries at least,and therefore intelligence was not very decisive. The only exceptionwas one episode during the Reagan military build-up during the 1980swhen Moscow, imprisoned in its own paranoia, was convinced thatthe United States was preparing a nuclear \ufb01rst strike. Fortunately, theKGB\u2019s chief of\ufb01cer in London had volunteered to spy for Britain. Healerted British of\ufb01cials to Moscow\u2019s concern, and Britain shared thisintelligence with the United States. Senior American leaders, includ-ing President Reagan, were aghast and took pains to reassure theirSoviet counterparts.\n23\nIn contrast to deterrence, prevention \u2013 whether by preemption, dis-\nruption, or simply defending vulnerabilities \u2013 requires enormous pre-cision in intelligence. Consider military preemption against enemies\u2019dangerous weapons, like WMD. America\u2019s capacity for intelligence,surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) is unparalleled, in a world classby itself. It is also improving rapidly. However, its shortcomings arevirtual descriptions of the features of our foes\u2019 WMD programs. Exist-ing ISR is not good at detecting objects that are hidden under foliage,concealed, or especially underground; neither is it good at locatingobjects precisely by intercepting their signals. Would-be proliferatorsconceal their facilities or change the pattern of activities at weaponssites, as India did before its 1998 explosion of a nuclear weapon. Withrespect to the puzzle of North Korean nuclear weapons, the best thatU.S. intelligence could do in the 2000s was a \u201cguesstimate\u201d that thecountry had some but with no judgment about location suf\ufb01cient topermit a preemptive strike.\nIf terrorist threats are to be prevented by disrupting them or by\nclosing the vulnerabilities they seek to exploit, then immense pressureis placed on intelligence to understand threats well enough, soonenough. It means moving back up the chain from possible terroristacts to groups and their proclivities, if not their intentions. It requiresan understanding of mysteries or complexities that is as \ufb01ne-grainedas the Cold War understanding of the puzzle of Soviet missile\nThe Changed Target 39\ncapabilities. In one respect, however, deterrence and prevention arealike: in both cases, the goal is nothing \u2013 no attack. This raises thequestion of metrics: for deterrence, metrics for policy more than forintelligence; for prevention, metrics for intelligence more than forpolicy because prevention is so intelligence-intensive. If there is noattack, did policy and intelligence succeed, was the country merelylucky, or was the threat exaggerated from the beginning?\n\u201cWe\u2019re All Bayesians Now\u201d\nI recently met a former colleague, a former Soviet (now Russian)specialist, in the halls of the CIA, and we had a conversation aboutmethods of intelligence analysis. At one point, he quipped: \u201cWe\u2019re allBayesians now.\u201d The quip stayed with me. Bayesian derives from a\nfamous theorem discovered by an English preacher, Thomas Bayes,and published in 1763. It has come to describe both an inclination anda process to update subjective probabilities in light of new evidence.In an important sense, almost all intelligence analysis is and alwayshas been Bayesian, for even with regard to puzzles, \ufb01nding thepiece\nthat will solve the puzzle with certainty is rare. However, the uncer-tainty and unboundedness of transnational targets, especially terror-ists, underscore the need for both a Bayesian attitude and more formalapproaches to making that approach concrete.\nThe basic idea is easiest to capture with a puzzle. Suppose I hand\nyou a coin. You assume that it is a fair coin and that if you toss it, headsand tails are equally likely outcomes. Therefore, your initial estimateis that it is a fair coin. However, suppose you begin tossing it; if youget heads three times in a row, you might begin to suspect the coinis not fair. You probably would not reject that assumption altogetherbecause you know that the chances are one in eight that a fair coinwould yield three straight heads. Rather, you would adjust your initialcertainty that the coin is fair and begin to entertain the thought thatit might not be. If additional tosses produced still more imbalancestoward heads, you would move toward the judgment that the coin isunfair.\nIn a Bayesian sense, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s famous\nquote about United Nations (UN) inspections searching for WMDin the run-up to the 2003 Iraq war was dead wrong: \u201cThe absence\n40 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nof evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence.\u201d24What he\nmeant was that just because UN inspectors had not found evidence ofactive WMD programs did not prove that Iraq had no such programs.Of course, that was right. Yet, in a Bayesian sense, each day that theUN inspectors did not \ufb01nd evidence of WMD should have shifted theodds in the direction of Iraq not having them. The way the puzzle wasframed \u2013 \u201cDoes Saddam Hussein have WMD?\u201d \u2013 meant that it couldhave been solved de\ufb01nitively in only one direction: \u201cYes, he does.\u201dOtherwise, Rumsfeld could have continued to repeat the same argu-ment until every square inch of Iraq had been searched. In a Bayesiansense, however, he would have been wrong not to entertain more andmore strongly the possibility that Iraq, in fact, had no WMD programsor stockpiles.\nThe Bayesian approach is easiest to grasp for puzzles because of\nthe direct relationship between new puzzle pieces of informationand more con\ufb01dence about the puzzle\u2019s solution. However, as an ap-proach \u2013 a way of thinking \u2013 it is probably even more important formysteries and complexities because it not only underscores the inher-ent uncertainty but also forces hard conversation \u2013 in a sensemakingprocess \u2013 about precisely what a new piece of evidence (or logic)means and how much difference it makes.\nTraditional warning is a Bayesian process, although it is not always\nperceived that way. Warning seeks to turn a mystery \u2013 \u201cAre they goingto attack?\u201d \u2013 into a puzzle by identifying indicators along the path towar and then monitoring them. The logic of warning can be extendedto other intelligence problems \u2013 for instance, the possibility that aterrorist group is indeed planning an attack or that a suspected ter-rorist group is seeking a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear(CBRN) weapon. For some of those issues, the paths might be morenumerous and, thus, the collection problem more dif\ufb01cult.\nIn one sense, the warning (or the CBRN) problem is no different\nthan many more familiar intelligence challenges: it requires intelli-gence from several sources to be laid atop one another, perhaps inshort order \u2013 what has come to be called \u201cmulti-INT\u201d in intelligencejargon. In the case of warning, very few indicators are \u201cunique\u201d signi-\ufb01ers \u2013 that is, actions that only (or virtually only) bespeak an attack,\nnot other and legitimate purposes. In the Cold War, troops needed to\nThe Changed Target 41\nleave their garrisons to train; therefore, indicators that troops had lefttheir garrisons were suggestive but hardly de\ufb01nitive. Rather, the warn-ing became serious if more indicators began to \ufb02ash. Likewise, intelli-gence cannot follow every suspicious group, so it would have to com-bine some information about groups with the Bayesian-path analysis.There would have to be a hint or tip that a particular group might beterrorists to trigger a monitoring of its activities along paths to attackor especially to lethal weapons.\nThe analogy of terrorism with warning can be extended, as will be\ndiscussed, because in both cases, policy measures may sharpen theBayesian updating of probabilities by making actions more uniqueor more visible. In the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-zation (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact negotiated con\ufb01dence-buildingmeasures (CBMs) that, for instance, required prenoti\ufb01cation of train-ing and maneuvers above a certain size. As a result, if intelligencecollection detected out-of-garrison activity that had not been prenoti-\ufb01ed, the indication would become more unique precisely because theCBM was in effect.Paths to Warning. The \ufb01rst step in this Bayesian analysis, for warn-\ning or for terrorism threats, is asking, \u201cWhat information is impor-tant?\n25What should be collected?\u201d For warning, it begins with paths\nto attack. \u201cWhat would a potential adversary need to do to pose athreat of attack?\u201d This path would run all the way back to intelligenceabout military capabilities because they would structure a potentialadversary\u2019s possibilities for attack. Then, against those capabilities,the challenge would be to develop indicators that could be detectedon the path to war. This is true for terrorism as well as for traditionalwarning.\nIn traditional warning, however, the set of indicators usually would\nbe bounded, if perhaps not small in number, and some of the indica-tors might be fairly clear-cut. In the Cold War central-front example,if indicators had detected signi\ufb01cant Warsaw Pact movements out ofgarrison, not prenoti\ufb01ed, in a Bayesian sense, that movement wouldhave raised the probability of attack from very low to quite high.In contrast, indicators for terrorists will be less bounded and lessdecisive.\n42 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThe dif\ufb01culty is that even when a group is identi\ufb01ed as potential\nterrorists, the paths to attack \u2013 and, thus, the possible set of indica-tors along those paths \u2013 would be very large and also would includemany that were not de\ufb01nitively linked to a terrorist attack. The pathswould include reconnaissance of targets, purchase of explosives orother weaponry, travel for reconnaissance or training, exercises orrehearsal, and so on. Even trying to anticipate more speci\ufb01c attacks,such as those with CBRN weapons, would still be made dif\ufb01cult by thenumbers of CBRN weapons and paths to buy, steal, or develop them.Biological weapons, for instance, include four groups: aerobic bacte-ria, anaerobic bacteria, viruses, and biological toxins. Again, otherintelligence sources might provide hints for which particular agentshave been of interest to terrorist groups,\n26which might lead to select-\ning, for example, anthrax, botulinum toxin, ricin, and several others asweapons of \ufb01rst concern along biological-weapons paths.\nJust as traditional warning would want to ensure as many paths\nto war as possible had been identi\ufb01ed, in principle, the Bayesian ap-proach to terrorism would seek to identify as many paths to terror-ism \u2013 or CBRN terrorism \u2013 as possible. Again, separate intelligence,perhaps from another source, about recent attempted attacks or theproclivities of groups would help to pare the number of paths. Thosepaths might be divided into phases, such as surveilling and selectingtargets; acquiring training; purchasing (or stealing or making) equip-ment; making weapons; staging and practicing; and so on. For at leastsome CBRN attacks, it might be worth elaborating the possible pathsin advance \u2013 admittedly, an extensive process. For that purpose, thepaths might again be divided into phases: developing the concept,acquiring the materials, building a weapon, and deploying it.Uniqueness. Because most steps along all the paths to a terrorist\nattack will have possible purposes other than an attack, looking forsteps and therefore indicators that rank higher in \u201cuniqueness\u201d is crit-ical. Carefully inspecting a building can be terrorist surveillance, butit can also be simply tourism or curiosity. For reasons of uniqueness,traditional warning was dif\ufb01cult to extend to more political and eco-nomic issues. Many political indicators, for instance, might be rele-vant to foreseeing a coup or other sudden change of government but\nThe Changed Target 43\nwould be, at best, ambiguously related to that warning \u2013 they were not,in the sense of Bayesian analysis, very unique. If a step or indicatorhas few applications other than a terrorist attack, it is highly unique;by contrast, if it has many applications, it is less unique. Uniquenesstends to trump simple importance because a step that is importantbut not very unique is of limited use to intelligence. For instance,acquiring laboratory equipment is important in almost any path toproducing biological weapons, yet that action ranks low in uniqueness.Possible purchasers of laboratory equipment range from students tohobbyists to an enormous range of legitimate businesses. Therefore,giving much attention to that action in the absence of other indica-tions that a group is potentially terrorists would be a simple waste oftime.\nComputers are also important in building a nuclear weapon but\nhardly unique. In contrast, buying or stealing enough \ufb01ssile materialto make a nuclear weapon is very unique \u2013 it bespeaks an interestin building such a weapon. In this manner, asking about uniquenessgives intelligence a way to determine which items along a path deservefocus.Visibility. For indicators, visibility is also critical. Something that can-\nnot be monitored by intelligence is not very useful as an indicator. Thedecision by an opponent\u2019s general staff to launch preparations for anattack would be wonderful warning but is not likely to be very visible.For that reason, espionage, which may or may not be available on anygiven day, generally cannot be counted on for warning; it is a target-of-opportunity business. Is there some way a particular indicator man-ifests itself so it could be searched for or recognized? The answers willdiffer across phases and tasks. Much of terrorist planning, for instance,will be invisible to intelligence until long after the fact, left in terror-ist staging areas, or available only with luck \u2013 such as seizing a com-puter in a cave in Afghanistan. By contrast, recruitments may be morevisible, along with some kinds of training. In the biological-weaponsexample, acquiring laboratory equipment is important but not veryunique. Moreover, it is also generally not very visible. If, by contrast,a group suspected of terrorism recruited a biologist, that action mightbe more unique andmore visible.\n44 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nVisibilityUnnotifiedtroopmovements\nAcquirelaboratoryequipmentRecruitmicrobiologistsGeneral staffdecision toprepare attack\nAcquireplutoniumUniqueness\nFigure 2.2. A Bayesian intelligence framework.\nThus, the two key characteristics of potential indicators are as\nfollows:\nrUniqueness: How indicative is the indicator of terrorism? Or arethere many other explanations for the indication that are not rela-ted to terrorism?\nrVisibility: How much does a step, phase, or task on the path to ter-rorism lend itself to being monitored by intelligence?In a Bayesian approach, the intelligence problem becomes an\nassessment of conditional probabilities. That is, against a prior suspi-cion that a group might engage in terrorism, does each available indi-cator increase or diminish that suspicion? Each additional observationmade with respect to an individual or group provides additional infor-mation \u2013 like additional \ufb02ips of the coin \u2013 permitting analysts to shar-pen their assessment of whether that person or group is more likely toengage in terrorism.\nThe two characteristics provide the basis for an intelligence frame-\nwork, as suggested by Figure 2.2.\nIdeally, intelligence would focus on indicators that were both very\nindicative of terrorism as opposed to another more benign activity andvery visible. Alas, the world frustrates the convenience of intelligence;therefore, few potential indicators fall in the upper right portion ofFigure 2.2 \u2013 such as large, unnoti\ufb01ed troop movements on the central\nThe Changed Target 45\nfront during the Cold War. Most indicators will be like acquiring lab-oratory equipment in the bioweapons example \u2013 perhaps importantbut not useful for intelligence because they are low in uniqueness andvisibility. Thus, it is shown in Figure 2.2 near the origin on both axes.By contrast, acquiring a microbiologist is more detectable and moreunique, although surely not high on either characteristic.\nStill, if the objective of an intelligence strategy is to detect terror-\nist attacks, especially those including CBRN weapons, it should con-centrate on the indicators along the paths that rate higher along eachdimension shown \u2013 that is, those that fall farthest from the origin. Forinstance, for terrorist paths to nuclear weapons, acquiring plutoniumis quite unique and also detectable by intelligence. It is shown in theupper right-hand corner in Figure 2.2. These judgments could thenhelp target further surveillance or other intelligence collection.\nBoth uniqueness and visibility depend on the context, and poli-\ncies can increase both, especially visibility. In terms of context, if theframework were applied not to an industrial society, like the UnitedStates or Britain, but instead to a poor region of the world with onlya limited industrial base, even the acquisition of laboratory equip-ment might acquire some uniqueness. On analogous reasoning aboutuniqueness, after September 11 when NSA began trolling throughlarge numbers of telephone calls, it concentrated on those parts of theworld known to harbor terrorists, such as the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistanborder. Similarly, large purchases of fertilizer might carry moreuniqueness in a large city than in a rural agricultural area \u2013 althoughthey might not be very visible in either locale.\nSimilar considerations can also apply to visibility: transactions that\nare buried among thousands or millions of others in rich countries \u2013thus obscuring the signal with enormous noise \u2013 might stand out morein poorer countries. That might be true whether the activity wereobserved in surveillance or detected by SIGINT, and it might applyto a wide range of indicators from simple international travel \u2013 whichis much rarer to and from poor regions \u2013 to possession of materialsthat could be used to produce weapons.\nCold War CBMs, a policy instrument, increased uniqueness more\nthan visibility. Large troop movements would have been visible in anycase, but CBM limitations on out-of-garrison activity implied that anyactivity over the limit was \u2013 on the face of it \u2013 threatening. Policies\n46 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ncan also make some of the steps along paths to terrorism more visible.For instance, in 2007, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission tight-ened procedures for licenses to acquire radioactive materials afterU.S. Government Accountability Of\ufb01ce investigators, posing as WestVirginia businesspeople, obtained a license in twenty-eight days usingnothing more sophisticated than a telephone, a fax machine, and arented post of\ufb01ce box. The move sought to make acquiring radioac-tive materials more transparent.\nA similar intent lay behind the expansion of suspicious activity\nreporting (SAR) requirements in the United States after September11. However, that was widely perceived as simply amassing reports tono real advantage, and private businesspeople began asking for moreclarity in what was required to be reported. In effect, possible paths toterrorist acts were not speci\ufb01ed clearly enough; therefore, what was afruitful indicator remained ambiguous.\nPart of this strategy might also be to collect and analyze combi-\nnations of observations that, taken alone, might not raise a \ufb02ag but,taken jointly, could be alarming. For instance, in some circumstances,buying large quantities of fertilizer might be suspicious but notstrongly so. If, however, that action were combined with other pur-chases relevant to building a bomb, such as triggering mechanisms andrenting a closed panel truck, then the combination could be alarmingin the sense of sharply raising the Bayesian probability of an attack \u2013perhaps raising it more than the sum of the three actions had theyoccurred independently.\nIn another example, if a suspect person or group acquired a milling\nmachine, it could be an indicator of their possibly pursuing radiologi-cal weapons. Several paths to such weapons require a milling machineto grind radiological materials into a \ufb01ne powder that then couldbe dispersed ef\ufb01ciently. However, because milling machines are alsocommon in industry, observing the purchase of only a milling machinewould only slightly increase the suspicion that a radiological weaponwas being developed.\nBy contrast, observing the purchases of a milling machine and\nshielding equipment might increase suspicion. Shielding equipmentis more unique, so its purchase alone would increase the suspicionmore than the purchase of only a milling machine. However, thereis synergy between the two, so observing the two purchases togethermight increase the suspicion more than the sum of the two observed\nThe Changed Target 47\nseparately. For illustration, if the effect was a 3 percent increase inthe belief for a milling machine alone and a 35 percent increase forthe shielding equipment alone, the two together would result in a45 percent increase in the suspicion of a radiological weapon beingdeveloped.\nParticular observations or combinations would also suggest what\nto look for next \u2013 again, a key reason for employing the Bayesianintelligence strategy. Take as an the example the task of assessing theprobability that a person or group is developing a type of radiolog-ical device, or \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d If the observations revealed the pres-ence of radiological materials or a Geiger counter, that fact wouldsuggest that shielding equipment should also be present because thetwo items are often collocated. The logic would move from one actionto the next along a particular path.\n27If a group were observed investi-\ngating sources of radiological materials, that observation would affectthe suspicion that the group was interested in acquiring radiologicalmaterials \u2013 which, in turn, would affect the suspicion about whetherthe group is developing a radiological weapon.\nIn an information-rich environment, it is necessary to have a\nmethod to determine which resources should be explored next to max-imize leverage in updating suspicions. Bayesian networks provide asystematic method for updating the suspicion that a particular set ofobservations indicates a person or group is planning a terrorist attack.The approach permits intelligence to identify which observations havethe most leverage by exploring how different combinations of evi-dence bear on the assessment of whether, for instance, a terrorist actis being planned or a CBRN weapon is being developed.\nThe CBRN problem is like other transnational \u201ccomplexities\u201d in\nthat it requires a wide variety of experts \u2013 in this case, rangingacross the set of possible attacks, weapons, and paths to them \u2013 alongwith people who have some sense for visibility, what intelligence candetect. The point is then to use the framework as a logic structurefor how observations affect prior beliefs or suspicions. For example,if shielding equipment already has been observed, what should col-lection focus on next to provide the greatest leverage in determiningwhether a radiological weapon is being developed?\nTo be sure, the process is complicated, and it lacks the time\nurgency that is likely to be characteristic of sensemaking with regardto other intelligence challenges of dealing with terrorist complexities.\n48 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nElaborating paths in detail would justify the cost for only the mostlethal of potential terrorist threats, such as those with CBRN wea-pons. That elaboration of paths would be applied to a particulargroup only if there were reason to believe it was engaged in plan-ning terrorism. However, these examples suggest something aboutthe nature of the process that will be required for many transnationalissues \u2013 Bayesian, iterative, involving a varied set of experts, and con-ducted in the awareness that uncertainty cannot be resolved entirely,only reduced.\n3\nThe Cold War Legacy\nWhen I gave lectures in the early years after September 11, I wasoften asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the FBI and the CIA cooperate better be-fore September 11?\u201d My answer was then and would still be now,\u201cBecause we, the American people, didn\u2019t want them to.\u201d We fearedthat the concentration of police and intelligence power would infringeon the privacy and liberties of our citizens. Especially after the con-gressional investigations of the 1970s, we had decided as a peoplethat \u2013 out of concern for privacy and civil liberties \u2013 the two agenciesshould not be too close. By the latter stages of the Cold War, whenearly concern about communists linked to Moscow in our midstturned out to be exaggerated (to put it gently), raggedy cooperationbetween the two agencies was good enough. However, it set us up tofail on September 11, 2001.\nThat is the \ufb01rst sense in which the Cold War legacy of intelligence\nwas and is mismatched to the transnational threat that the UnitedStates and its allies now face. The FBI and the CIA sit astride thefundamental boundaries, or \u201cdistinctions,\u201d of the Cold War \u2013 bound-aries between intelligence and law enforcement, between foreign anddomestic, and between public and private. The nation said that just aslaw enforcement was one thing and intelligence another, so too it dis-tinguished sharply between home and abroad and between the publicand the private sectors. The distinctions run very deep.\nThe boundaries were reinforced by the second of the Cold War\nlegacies: the institutional legacy. The lion\u2019s share of what the UnitedStates spends on intelligence went and still goes for collection. Sat-ellites and other sophisticated collection platforms are expensive,\n49\n50 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nwhile analysts are inexpensive by comparison. Collection came tobe organized in what government of\ufb01cials call \u201cstovepipes,\u201d and, asimportant, the stovepipes were denominated by source. The clandes-\ntine service, or directorate of operations, of the CIA was primarilyresponsible for HUMINT; the NSA for SIGINT; and the NGA forpictures and other IMINT.\nFor its part, analysis was organized primarily by agency, not by\nissue or problem. The CIA\u2019s Directorate of Intelligence was \ufb01rstamong equals, but the DIA was just as big, and the much smaller INRtended to punch well above its weight in interagency discussions. Themilitary services each had its own intelligence arm, primarily address-ing the foreign threats that its service\u2019s weaponry would confront, andthe joint combatant commands also had their intelligence units, heav-ily tactical in orientation. In Washington, there were smaller analyticunits in departments ranging from Energy to Commerce. Those wereexplicitly departmental, serving the needs of local consumers.\nThe ways that both collection and analysis were structured made\nsense during the Cold War. On the collection side, with one overarch-ing target \u2013 the Soviet Union and its allies, a target that was mostlytreated as a puzzle \u2013 the structure asked the stovepipes, in effect,\u201cWhat can you add to our understanding of the target? What puzzlepieces can you add to solving the Soviet puzzle?\u201d\nOn the analytic side as well, the work of the intelligence organi-\nzations was highly focused on the Soviet Union. In that circumstance,organizing by agency made sense. It permitted a combination of com-petition, with analysts from different agencies looking at essentiallythe same information from somewhat different perspectives, pro-fessional backgrounds, and specialization \u2013 for example, DIA ana-lysts naturally focused more on military dimensions of problems thatcut across the military and the political. The organization by agencymeant that all the analytic organizations, except the CIA, worked for\na set of consumers and therefore could tailor their work to the needsof those consumers.\nThe \ufb01nal Cold War legacy was the product of the boundaries.\nDomestic intelligence was a stepchild in the system. Unlike most ofits major partners, the United States had not created a domestic-intelligence service. Rather, the domestic-intelligence function con-tinued to be performed by the FBI, where it was twice circumscribed.\nThe Cold War Legacy 51\nIt was part of an FBI that \ufb01rst and foremost was a law enforcementorganization, which occasioned the post\u2013September 11 quip abouttrying to understand the FBI pre\u2013September 11 through intelligence.Intelligence may have been important but surely was not central. Sec-ond, the domestic-intelligence function was limited by the bound-ary between intelligence and law enforcement, a \u201cwall\u201d that alsoextended inside the FBI and inhibited cooperation among intelli-gence and law enforcement of\ufb01cials, even those working on similarissues.\nThe set of institutions, practices, and conceptions that built up dur-\ning the \u201chot war\u201d and the long ensuing Cold War may have served theUnited States well enough then \u2013 although that is a debated point, toput it gently.\n1However, they set up the nation to fail on September 11,\n2001, and they continue to set us up to fail. The mismatch is most vis-ible in the campaign against terrorism; therefore, that is the focus ofthis chapter. However, the legacy ran well beyond terrorism and non-state actors \u2013 it also affected how we designed military power and howwe perceived its use. The long Cold War against an opponent whoseonly asset was military might suffuse our approach to intelligence, justas it colored our view of the world. It militarized U.S. foreign policyand gave pride of place to technology over statecraft.\nIt is important to emphasize that this mismatched legacy was not\nentirely in\ufb02icted on the United States. The visible mismatches in thecampaign against terrorism we mostly in\ufb02icted on ourselves. Theywere in\ufb02icted on us in the ways that usually get the most attentionfrom an observer: powerful personalities, like the CIA and the FBIdirectors who were not on speaking terms when I \ufb01rst went to Wash-ington in the 1970s and bureaucratic \ufb01ghts over turf. There was alsothe sharp distinction in organizational culture that is explored in thischapter. Yet, in the end, those mismatches were also done in thename of privacy and civil liberties and were, on the whole, a sensibleresponse to the threat the nation then faced.\n2If the price of ragged\ncooperation between the CIA and the FBI during the Cold War wasan occasional botched handoff of a spy that moved into or out of theUnited States, it was not too high a price.\nThe price became too high on September 11, and the nation\nis rethinking the set of organizational distinctions and proceduralrestraints that it developed during the Cold War. Then, the country\n52 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ncame \u2013 haltingly but in the end \ufb01rmly \u2013 to a striking of the balancebetween security and privacy. September 11 demonstrated that thenation faces a very different threat, one that compels a rethinking ofthe balance, which is and will be as halting as the Cold War process.Moreover, the balance that was struck combines organizational dis-tinctions with constitutional protections and restraints on of\ufb01cial dis-cretion. As a result, the rethinking involves how government organi-zations relate to one another, to the Constitution, and to the country\u2019scitizens.\nbuilding the legacy of boundaries\nBy the mid-1970s, if the period still seemed one of high Cold War,at least the communist threat on the home front had faded. In thatcontext, the nation\u2019s \ufb01rst-ever investigations of intelligence looked forabuses of the rights of Americans and found them, especially in a curi-ous mixing of intelligence, or counterintelligence, and law enforce-ment at the FBI during J. Edgar Hoover\u2019s long tenure as director.\n3\nThe justi\ufb01cation and ostensible target of these \u201ccounterintelligenceprograms\u201d (COINTELPROs) was the operations of hostile foreign in-telligence services and their possible involvement in (especially)protests against the war in Vietnam.\n4However, most of COINTEL-\nPRO\u2019s speci\ufb01c targets were American citizens in civil rights and anti-war groups. People such as the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.,were not only surveilled but also harassed \u2013 and worse.\nIn reaction to the revelations, the nation judged that if the commu-\nnist threat at home had ever justi\ufb01ed intrusive surveillance of Amer-icans, it did so no longer. The domestic-intelligence activities of theFBI were sharply restrained, and the \u201cwall\u201d separating intelligencefrom law enforcement was built higher. A compromise between pres-idential discretion and civil liberties resulted in the 1978 passage ofthe FISA and the creation of the Foreign Intelligence SurveillanceCourt (FISC), a court operating in secret to grant covert wiretappingand other surveillance authority for intelligence \u2013 as opposed to lawenforcement \u2013 purposes.\n5Before the FISC, presidents had claimed\nthe right of searches for national-security purposes with no warrantswhatsoever \u2013 a claim to which President George W. Bush returnedafter September 11.\nThe Cold War Legacy 53\nThe wall between intelligence and law enforcement had effects all\nacross both domains, and the FISA made the divide explicit. If theFBI or other of\ufb01cials sought wiretaps or other surveillance for crimi-nal cases, they had to submit Title III af\ufb01davits to federal courts, indi-cating the \u201cprobable cause\u201d that the location or communication linebeing bugged had been or was being used to commit crimes. If, bycontrast, the purpose of the surveillance was national security, withno reasonable case that a crime had yet been committed, then thechain of procedure was the one de\ufb01ned in the FISA: from the FBI tothe Department of Justice to the FISC.\nEspionage is a dif\ufb01cult conviction to make because the foreign\npower handling an American spy is hardly likely to cooperate. Inthose circumstances, most convictions occur when spies confess, whichmeans that probable cause would be too high a standard even forcriminal cases of espionage, especially in the early stages. For terror-ism intelligence, it would be a crippling standard because only onecrime might ultimately be committed, and then it would be too late.As Chapter 2 emphasizes, the goal of investigation against terrorismhas to be to prevent terrorism, not prosecute it.\nThe FISA and the FISC were relegated as Cold War footnotes as\nlong as their primary purpose was to sanction surveillance on foreigninstallations in the United States or on Americans suspected of spy-ing for foreign powers. That task of keeping track of \u201cwhite-collar\u201dspies was consigned to the CD of the FBI, a type of service within aservice, proud of its own work but not a path to rapid ascent in whatwas preeminently a law enforcement agency. The FISA and domes-tic intelligence became prominent in the post\u2013September 11 debateabout whether more could \u2013 and should \u2013 have been done to preventthe attacks, and then again \ufb01ve years later, when it transpired thatPresident Bush had ordered the NSA to sharply increase interceptionsof communications in the wake of September 11, including communi-cations of Americans with those suspected of terrorist connections.The administration had not used the FISA process to authorize thewiretaps. Its main argument for why it had not was that the FISA pro-cess was too cumbersome; however, the music behind the words wasa reversion to the historical argument that presidents had an inherentright to resort to warrantless surveillance when national security wasat stake.\n6\n54 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nIf, until September 11, the investigations of the 1970s were the \ufb01nal\nact in striking the Cold War balance between security and liberty, theyrested on a longer history of postwar institution building. Now, therebalancing means not just reshuf\ufb02ing intelligence and law enforce-ment organizations and refashioning their cultures, it also meansrethinking basic categories of threat and response.\nLaw enforcement and intelligence are different worlds, with dif-\nferent missions, operating codes, and standards. The differences weredriven home to me in the Clinton administration in the mid-1990s.Iraqi intelligence was suspected of being behind a plot to kill the \ufb01rstPresident Bush during a post-presidential visit to Kuwait. The plotto plant a bomb never came anywhere close to the former president,but the Clinton administration still confronted the issue of whether toretaliate in some fashion. It put together a team that combined CIAintelligence analysts with FBI and Justice Department law enforce-ment of\ufb01cers. Watching the two interact was fascinating because thedisciplines are so different. In the end, the Clinton administrationdecided that the case for involvement by Iraqi intelligence was strongenough to call for cruise-missile strikes against Iraq.\nIntelligence, what John Le Carr \u00b4e refers to as \u201cpure intelligence,\u201d\nis oriented toward the future and toward policy \u2013 that is, it seeks toinform the making of policy.\n7Living in a blizzard of uncertainty\nwhere the \u201ctruth\u201d will never be known for certain, intelligence seeksto understand new information in light of its existing understandingof complex situations. Thus, its standard is \u201cgood enough for gov-ernment work.\u201d In the Iraqi case, that meant good enough for whatour Pentagon colleagues called \u201cTLAM therapy\u201d \u2013 that is, retalia-tion against Iraq by strikes with U.S. cruise missiles, speci\ufb01cally Tom-ahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs).\nBecause intelligence strives above all to protect sources and meth-\nods, its of\ufb01cials want desperately to stay out of the chain of evidenceso they will not have to testify in court. Protecting sources and meth-ods is intelligence\u2019s highest calling. By contrast, in the military, forinstance, if of\ufb01cers have to cut corners with classi\ufb01ed documents inorder to get the job done, they do so. As a result, during the periodwhen I was at the NIC, I sometimes had dif\ufb01culty getting senior mil-itary of\ufb01cers through the CIA polygraph (i.e., lie detector). They\nThe Cold War Legacy 55\nsimply came from a different culture than that of pure intelligence;so does law enforcement.\nBy contrast to intelligence, law enforcement is oriented not forward\nbut rather toward response; it is after the fact. Its business is not pol-icy but rather prosecution, and its method is cases. Law enforcementstrives to put \u201cbad guys\u201d in jail. Its standard is high, good enough for acourt of law \u2013 or, in the Iraqi case, good enough for the court of inter-national public opinion. Law enforcement knows that if it is to makea case, it must be prepared to reveal something of how it knows whatit knows; at least, it is aware that it will face that choice.\nTraditional law enforcement has no real history of analysis in the\nintelligence sense of the term; indeed, the meaning of the word intelli-\ngence is different for law enforcement, in which it means \u201ctips\u201d to \ufb01nd-\ning and convicting evildoers more than looking for patterns to framefuture decisions. To be sure, \u201cintelligence-led policing,\u201d which wasdeveloped in England in the 1990s, was given an urgency by Septem-ber 11. It rejects the reactive nature of traditional law enforcement,seeking instead to identify and manage emerging criminal problems.It seeks, in short, to prevent the next crime, not just prosecute the lastone. Yet, it is \ufb01rst and foremost a collection strategy, one that empha-sizes awareness of the local domain; in that, it has much in commonwith what is called community policing .\n8Law enforcement and polic-\ning also traditionally have been de\ufb01ned in geographical units. Thesede\ufb01nitions are increasingly mismatched to threats such as terrorismthat respect no geographical boundaries.\nDifferent cultures compounded the effect of the wall. For instance,\nFBI agents have Top Secret clearances, but few are cleared into theSCI that is the woof and warp of intelligence. Therefore, when facedby unfamiliar FBI counterparts in meetings, CIA of\ufb01cers would begenuinely uncertain about how much they could say. For differentreasons \u2013 those related to the fear of compromising criminal cases inprogress \u2013 FBI agents would be similarly reticent. The safest coursewas to say nothing. If the conversation turned to matters domestic,then the CIA of\ufb01cials would also be uncertain about how much theyshould hear .\nCooperation between the two was probably best in the Coun-\nterterrorism Center (CTC), under the DCI before the 2004 Act but\n56 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nprimarily a CIA organization, and the limits even there were sug-gested by the handling of the terrorist watch list (discussed later in thischapter). Because CTC was an intelligence organization, it was and isoriented abroad. It was also heavily operational, seeking to disruptterrorist networks \u2013 again abroad. To the extent that law enforcementcould be a tool in accomplishing that foreign task, it was welcome \u2013although CIA agents would be careful to stay out of the chain of evi-dence. Working on operations abroad through the CTC was terrain onwhich cooperation between the two agencies was easier than it couldbe in following terrorists in and out of the United States.\nA second distinction, foreign versus domestic, magni\ufb01ed the intel-\nligence\u2013law enforcement disconnect. American institutions and prac-tices both during and prior to the Cold War drew a sharp distinc-tion between home and abroad. The FBI had conducted wartimeespionage and counterespionage in Latin America and, in December1944, Hoover had proposed that the FBI run worldwide intelligenceoperations similar to its Latin American operations.\n9The proposal\nhad some support outside the FBI, at the U.S. State Department inparticular. However, President Harry Truman worried openly thatgiving the intelligence mandate to the FBI would risk creating a\u201cGestapo-like\u201d organization; therefore, foreign operations went \ufb01rstto the Central Intelligence Group (i.e., the CIA predecessor) and thento the CIA. Both agencies, however, were barred from law enforce-ment and domestic operations.\nRelations between the two agencies were ragged from the start.\nWhen I went to Washington to work on the \ufb01rst-ever investigations ofintelligence in the 1970s, the directors of the CIA and the FBI literallydid not speak to one another. Their relationship improved over time,mostly because it could not get worse! The National Security Act of1947 was clear in proscribing the police function for the CIA. TheNSA, created later, was and is also barred from law enforcement anddomestic spying; therefore, if the trail of conversations or signals thatthe NSA was monitoring became \u201cdomestic\u201d \u2013 that is, involved a U.S.person, corporation, or even resident alien \u2013 then the trail had to end.That was what led to the FISA. Once enacted, the data from FISA\u2013authorized domestic wiretaps went to the FBI, not the NSA, which iswhy the \ufb02ap erupted in 2005 over the post\u2013September 11 NSA opera-tions involving telephone conversations of U.S. citizens.\nThe Cold War Legacy 57\nThe FBI was required to provide information to the DCI but only\nif that information was \u201cessential to the national security\u201d and only\u201cupon the written request\u201d of the DCI.\n10The FBI also was responsi-\nble for protecting material before federal grand juries and, althoughsharing was possible, in practice information came to be shared onlywith a court order. Both sets of provisions were an invitation to theFBI to hoard information, not share it. Holding back was the care-ful thing to do lest providing information somehow contaminated aprosecution in progress.\nA third distinction is public versus private. During the Cold War,\nnational security was a government \u2013 and, largely, a federal govern-\nment \u2013 monopoly. To be sure, private companies and citizens playeda role but, for most citizens, \ufb01ghting the Cold War simply meant pay-ing their taxes. That does not seem likely to be true in the same degreefor the campaign against terrorism and for homeland security. Acrossthe country, there are three times as many \u201cpolice\u201d \u2013 security guardsand the like \u2013 in the private sector as in governments. Civilians\u2019 liveswill be affected \u2013 ranging from the inconvenience of waiting in longlines at airports to more dif\ufb01cult questions about how much securitywill make use of prescreening, national databanks, and biometrics.\nthe institutional legacy: tyranny\nof the \u201cstovepipes\u201d\nThat institutional legacy, on the collection side, was an organization ofstovepipes by source. Figure 3.1 illustrates that organization: the CIAclandestine service, or directorate of operations, primarily responsiblefor HUMINT; the NSA for SIGINT; and the NGA for pictures andother IMINT. Quaintly, intelligence referred and still refers to every-thing else \u2013 from newspapers to the entire Web to \u201cgray\u201d materialsthat might be private but not secret \u2013 as \u201copen source\u201d and sometimes\nHUMINT-\nCIASIGINT-\nNSAIMINT-\nNGA\u201cOpenSource\u201d-\n?\nFigure 3.1. Intelligence collection stovepipes by source.\n58 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nlabels those sources as a separate \u201cINT,\u201d OSINT. Intelligence ana-lysts have their hands full coping with the materials coming to theirworkstations from the secret INTs: HUMINT, SIGINT, and IMINT.As a result, while I was at the NIC, we used to joke that sometimesoutsiders did better than intelligence insiders because they were notdenied access to OSINT!\nSoon after I left the NIC for RAND in 1996, I was talking with\nmy colleague and squash partner, David Chu. Chu had been direc-tor of the Pentagon\u2019s policy-analysis shop, policy analysis and eval-uation (PA&E) for the entire twelve years of the Reagan and \ufb01rstBush administrations. Chu later served the administration of the sec-ond President Bush as undersecretary of defense. He fought manybureaucratic battles but never made them personal. In all those years,as far as I can tell, his grace and good spirit meant that he never madea permanent enemy \u2013 the rarest of rarities in modern-day Washington.\nOn that occasion in 1996, I suggested that the then-DCI and his\nstaff had not scrubbed the budgets of the major collector stovepipes,particularly the National Reconnaissance Of\ufb01ce (NRO) and the NSA,very hard because the money resided in the Pentagon budget. Weassumed, I ventured, that Chu and his colleagues were giving thosebudgets and programs a hard look. To my surprise, Chu respondedthat he thought the DCI had done the analysis! PA&E had not. I con-cluded, alas, that for better or worse, the stovepipe managers had beenleft with considerable autonomy.\nThe stovepipes were also baronies, all the more so because the\nbarons presided over arcane technical arts not easily grasped by merebudgeters or even by analysts. Through the years, various effortssought to draw on NIOs or other intelligence analysts to provide guid-ance to the big collectors. During my own time at the NIC, we askedthe NIOs to \ufb01nish every NIE or other major project with a post-mortem on collection: \u201cWhere in the process would more or differ-ent information \u2013 information that, in principle, could have been col-lected \u2013 have made a difference? If they wanted more, on what issueswould they be prepared to have less, given that collection capabilitieswere limited?\u201d\nThat process \u2013 which amounted to modestly reallocating collec-\ntion capabilities that already existed \u2013 was dif\ufb01cult enough, especiallyfor NIOs who came from outside intelligence and thus were relative\nThe Cold War Legacy 59\nnewcomers to the collection disciplines. Trying to extend the processin some form to in\ufb02uence what new collection capabilities might becreated ran into a more formidable obstacle. Because systems beguntoday would enter service years from now, it was not obvious that theneeds or tastes of current consumers, such as NIOs, should drive thosesystems. However, if not them, then who and how?\nAs a result, over time, those baronies had become encrusted in\ntheir own world. The numbers are classi\ufb01ed, but as long as a decadeago, the mismatch between money and result in the stovepipes wasmarked. In one instance, intelligence virtuosity with satellite collec-tion platforms turned NRO over time into a satellite designer andoperator. Thus, there was little surprise that intelligence did notcome quickly to other platforms for technical collection, especially theunmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or \u201cdrones\u201d in another era) that \ufb01g-ured so prominently in post\u2013September 11 operations in Afghanistanand Iraq. That same virtuosity also led to the situation in which themajority of SIGINT data came from ground stations, but the lion\u2019sshare of the money went to satellite collection. Past virtuosity madefor present slowness in understanding that SIGINT now has to getclose to the signals that it targets before they disappear into encryp-tion or huge \ufb01ber-optic lines.\nFor its part, analysis was organized primarily by agency, not by\nissue or problem. Although the directorate of intelligence of the CIAwas \ufb01rst among equals, the DIA was just as big in numbers. The INRwas a major player in interagency discussions \u2013 for instance, thoseleading to NIEs. The analytic arms of the military services \u2013 the Of\ufb01ceof Naval Intelligence, the National Ground Intelligence Center, andso on \u2013 were less visible in interagency discussions because their focushad been the foreign threats that their service\u2019s weaponry would con-front. The joint combatant commands \u2013 Paci\ufb01c Command (PACOM)and Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), for instance \u2013 also had theirown intelligence units. While those commands were heavily tacticalin orientation, they could be important players if an assessment con-cerned the risks of war in their area.\nIn Washington, there were smaller analytic units in departments\nranging from Energy to Commerce. The larger of those, such as thoseat Energy, actually did some intelligence analysis, while the smallerunits, such as those at Commerce, were basically information brokers,\n60 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nconveying and tailoring raw data or the assessments of other agenciesto their own customers. All those units were explicitly departmental,serving the needs of local consumers.\nThere was, perhaps, a certain logic to the organization of both col-\nlection and analysis during the Cold War. With one overwhelmingtarget, the Soviet Union, the various \u201cINTs\u201d were asked, in effect,what they could contribute to understanding the puzzle of the SovietUnion. Which additional puzzle pieces could they contribute? Puzzlepieces from one INT would redirect the search from another. Forinstance, if IMINT located a new Soviet production facility of inter-est, that imagery might be able to identify its general purpose by itscon\ufb01guration in comparison to other such facilities observed earlier.That would then be a spur for SIGINT to try and locate communica-tions traf\ufb01c to that facility \u2013 and, with any luck, including telephonetraf\ufb01c that might indicate not only what was being produced but alsofor what part of the Soviet establishment and when. Or, the processmight begin with an open-source account of some mysterious factoryopening \u2013 and so on.\nFor analysis, the logic was not so different. With a clearly identi-\n\ufb01ed target, the target of analysis was also obvious. The organizationby agency made possible a combination of specialization and com-petition against the clearly identi\ufb01ed target. The CIA and the DIAcould develop specializations with, for instance, the former concen-trating on technology \u2013 especially weapons technology \u2013 with the lat-ter giving more attention to military organizations and orders of bat-tle. Yet, the two overlapped enough so that there could be and wereintense debates about issues such as the speci\ufb01c qualities of majorSoviet weapons, especially nuclear-tipped missiles. Those debateswere fought in the continuing series of NIEs about Soviet conven-tional and nuclear forces. The most celebrated of those debates, in1969, concerned whether a new and large Soviet missile, the SS-9, car-ried warheads that could be targeted separately.\n11If it did, it threat-\nened the syllogism of deterrence (discussed in Chapter 2), raising therisk of a \u201cdisarming\u201d \ufb01rst strike by the Soviet Union against U.S. mis-sile forces for retaliation.\nThe organization of intelligence by agency, along with the relatively\ncontained set of consumers \u2013 primarily political and military of\ufb01cialsat the top of the U.S. government \u2013 meant that all the agencies except\nThe Cold War Legacy 61\nthe CIA knew for whom they worked: DIA found its customers atthe Pentagon, INR at the State Department, and so on. Working foreveryone, the CIA risked working for no one. Its most natural partnerwas the National Security Council (NSC) and especially the NSC staff,which was for much of the Cold War a small organization with a largemandate and, therefore, an equally large need for help.\nYet, if that organization made sense during the Cold War, it makes\nno sense for an age of terror. The transnational target outlined inChapter 2 is much less well de\ufb01ned. Indeed, policy and intelligenceare engaged in a joint effort to create a story or stories to comprehendthat threat. Meanwhile, the number of consumers has mushroomedand their nature has dramatically diversi\ufb01ed \u2013 from political\u2013militaryof\ufb01cials to cops on the beat and private-sector managers of majorinfrastructure. Moreover, information is also mushrooming, and mostof that information \u2013 in contrast to the Cold War \u2013 is not \u201cproduced\u201dor \u201cowned\u201d by intelligence agencies.\nIn those circumstances, the way to organize cannot be by stovepipe\nand agency; rather, it has to be by problem or issue. Figure 3.2 suggestssuch an organization, using one critical functional issue \u2013 terrorism \u2013and one key problem country \u2013 North Korea \u2013 as examples. The logicis to put consumers, sources, and analysts together \u2013 virtually in pref-erence to physically \u2013 because today\u2019s pressing problem may not betomorrow\u2019s and, once government organizations have buildings, theyare literally set in concrete.\nAs Chapter 5 discusses in more detail, this logic was embraced,\nalbeit rather tepidly, by the 2004 Act creating the DNI. It is re\ufb02ected\nConsumersSourcesAnalysts\nNorth Kore a\nTerrorism\nFigure 3.2. Intelligence organized by issue, not source or agency.\n62 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nin the idea of intelligence \u201ccenters\u201d as the basic work units of intel-ligence. So far, however, as Chapter 5 discusses, the idea has beenresisted by the main agencies; thus, the centers are few \u2013 by 2008, onlytwo and in areas where the DCI had already created CIA-dominatedcenters, counterterrorism and counterproliferation. In other areas, theDNI created mission managers intended to provide focus to both col-lection and analysis on key countries: North Korea, Iran, and Cuba\u2013Venezuela.\nthe fbi and the primacy of law enforcement\nIf the ragged cooperation between the CIA and the FBI is testimonyto the limited cooperation across intelligence and law enforcementas well as across foreign and domestic, other aspects of the Septem-ber 11 failure \u2013 especially the Phoenix memorandum and the Mous-saoui case \u2013 speak to the third main Cold War legacy: the mission andpractices of the FBI. The Bureau was preeminently a law enforce-ment organization; almost immediately after September 11, DirectorRobert Mueller began driving a sea change in the FBI mission to pre-vention and intelligence. The Bureau was and is dominated by specialagents, and those agents naturally were attracted to where there were\u201ccollars\u201d to be made \u2013 that is, criminals to be caught \u2013 which is notterrorism because terrorists ultimately might commit but one crime.Accordingly, the FBI viewed the world through the lens of the case\nand case \ufb01le . If information was not relevant to making a case, it was\nnot of much account. Therefore, the post\u2013September 11 investigationswere full of reports of terrorism training manuals and similar materi-als that went untranslated for years because they were not directlyrelevant to a particular case.\nThe Moussaoui misadventure illustrates some of the features of the\nFBI organizational culture, even though it was played out not in thecenter of the organization, law enforcement. Rather, it was in coun-terterrorism, which was before September 11 if not exactly a backwa-ter, then surely not an area in which there were many collars to bemade. In this instance, an FBI special agent in the Phoenix \ufb01eld of\ufb01cesent an electronic communication (EC) to FBI headquarters and tothe New York \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce on July 10, 2001.\n12The EC warned about\npotential dangers from Al Qaeda\u2013af\ufb01liated individuals training at\nThe Cold War Legacy 63\nU.S. \ufb02ight schools. The memorandum was sent to the Usama BinLaden Unit (UBLU) and the Radical Fundamentalist Unit (RFU)within the Bureau\u2019s counterterrorist organization. Headquarters per-sonnel, however, decided that no follow-up was needed, and no man-agers actually took part in this decision or even saw the memorandumbefore the September 11 attacks. The CIA was made aware of thePhoenix special agent\u2019s concerns about \ufb02ight schools, but it offeredno feedback despite the information that the CIA possessed aboutterrorists\u2019 interest in using aircraft as weapons.\nNeither did the FBI of\ufb01cials who saw the Phoenix EC at headquar-\nters ever connect those concerns with the body of information alreadyin the FBI\u2019s possession about terrorists\u2019 interest in obtaining trainingat U.S. \ufb02ight schools. The full contents of the \u201cPhoenix Memo\u201d werenot initially made public, but it is stunning that so little was made of it,especially because it drew attention to certain information already in\nthe FBI\u2019s possession suggesting a speci\ufb01c reason to be alarmed about\na particular foreign student at an aviation university in the UnitedStates.\n13Another of then\u2013Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld\u2019s famous\nquotations was his typology of intelligence questions: known knowns ,\nwhat we know we know; known unknowns, what we know we do not\nknow; and, most important for him, unknown unknowns , what we do\nnot know we do not know.14Yet, the episode \u2013 like the September 11\nuse of planes as bombs \u2013 is a reminder of the importance of unknown\nknowns : what we do not know (or do not remember) we know.\nThe foreign student was Zacarias Moussaoui \u2013 Zakaria Mustapha\nSoubra in the Phoenix memorandum \u2013 the suspected \u201ctwentiethhijacker,\u201d who was arrested on August 16, 2001, in Minneapolis fora visa violation. FBI agents at the \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce suspected him of ter-rorism and, with increasing desperation, sought to search his laptopcomputer but were denied permission by FBI headquarters. To getpermission, FBI \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces had to go through the usual FISA pro-cedure, requesting it through headquarters and the Department ofJustice\u2019s Of\ufb01ce of Intelligence Policy and Review (OIPR), with for-mal requests approved in secret by the FISC. Reportedly, of twelvethousand requests, the FISC turned down just one Justice Depart-ment request for authority.\n15All of the 1,228 requests submitted in\n2002 were eventually approved,16which raises the concern that the\nFISA bar may be set too low.\n64 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThe Moussaoui case, however, suggested that in practice, if not in\nlaw, the FBI and the Justice Department may have set the bar toohigh, at least before September 11. In that event, headquarters andFBI lawyers briefed orally by the agent handling the case believed thatthere was not enough evidence for a FISA search.\n17In the process,\nthe standard apparently applied was that there had to be \u201cprobablecause\u201d (i.e., substantial basis) that Moussaoui was an \u201cagent of a for-eign power,\u201d which in turn was interpreted to mean that he was linkedto an already \u201crecognized\u201d terrorist organization \u2013 which Moussaouiwas not because his link to Al Qaeda was as yet unknown.\nIn fact, the standard applied was more demanding than the law\nat the time, which required probable cause that the targeted personwas an \u201cagent of a foreign power,\u201d which in turn was de\ufb01ned as \u201canyperson who . . . knowingly aids or abets any person in the conduct of[certain] activities.\u201d Those activities include \u201cinternational terrorism,\u201dand one de\ufb01nition of \u201cforeign power\u201d includes groups that engage in\u201cinternational terrorism.\u201d\n18Moreover, those making decisions in the\nMoussaoui case never saw the now-famous EC from the Phoenix \ufb01eldof\ufb01ce, which arrived at headquarters in late July. The warnings in thatcommunication about suspicious activity at U.S. \ufb02ight schools wouldhave buttressed concerns about Moussaoui\u2019s own \ufb02ying lessons.\nThe Moussaoui case can be seen as a testament to sloppy proce-\ndures, poor information technology, tensions between FBI \ufb01eld of-\ufb01ces and headquarters, excessive caution or simple ignorance aboutcomplicated points of law, or all of those in some combination. It alsomay be that previous tensions between the FBI and the FISC had a\u201cchilling effect\u201d and made for more caution, which was alleged in theletter from Special Agent Coleen Rowley to FBI Director Mueller,dated May 21, 2002.\n19In any event, the case surely bespeaks consider-\nable \u2013 perhaps excessive \u2013 caution on the part of the FBI and the Jus-tice Department in venturing FISA requests onto new terrain. Foreignspies were one thing; foreign \u201cstudents,\u201d even those with worrisomeconnections, were quite another.\nThe Moussaoui case underscores what Senator Richard Shelby\n(R-AL) labeled the \u201ctyranny of the case \ufb01le.\u201d\n20That culture, if not\ntyranny, can hardly be overstated. Because the FBI was then and stillis, to a considerable extent, a law enforcement organization, its agentswere trained and acculturated, rewarded, and promoted within an\nThe Cold War Legacy 65\ninstitutional culture whose primary purpose was to capture and prose-cute criminals. Within the Bureau, information was stored, retrieved,and simply understood principally through the conceptual prism of a\n\u201ccase\u201d \u2013 a discrete bundle of information that is constructed to proveelements of crimes against speci\ufb01c potential defendants in a courtof law.\nThe culture and case-\ufb01le mindset meant that information the FBI\ncollected either was or was not relevant to the case at hand. If it wasrelevant, it often disappeared into federal grand juries. Before thePatriot Act of November 2001, it took a court order to share thatinformation with anyone, including CIA analysts \u2013 who, of course,usually would not know what information was there and thus mightbe requested. If the information collected was not relevant to the caseat hand, it often was simply discarded.\nFor instance, the FBI knew that convicted terrorist Abdul Hakim\nMurad had been involved in an extremist Islamic plot to blow uptwelve U.S.\u2013owned airliners over the Paci\ufb01c Ocean and crash an air-craft into CIA headquarters.\n21Murad was not charged with a crime in\nconnection with the CIA crash plot, apparently because that plot wasmerely at the \u201cdiscussion\u201d stage when he was apprehended. Becausethe CIA crash plot did not appear in the indictment, however, the FBIeffectively forgot about it, and Murad\u2019s case \ufb01le essentially ignored it.FBI agents interviewed by the joint congressional investigation con-\ufb01rmed that Murad\u2019s only signi\ufb01cance to them was speci\ufb01cally in con-nection with the crimes for which he was charged: \u201cThe other aspectsof the plot were not part of the criminal case and therefore not con-sidered relevant.\u201d\n22\nConvinced that the only information that really matters was infor-\nmation directly related to the criminal investigation at hand, the FBIthus ignored this early warning sign that terrorists had begun plan-ning to crash aircraft into symbols of U.S. power. As a result, ratherthan being stored in a form that would have permitted informationto be assessed and reassessed in light of a broader set of informa-tion about terrorist plans and intentions over time, the Murad data-point was simply forgotten. Like all the other tidbits of informationthat might have alerted a sophisticated analyst to terrorists\u2019 interestin using airplanes to attack building targets in the United States, thisepisode disappeared into the depths of an old case \ufb01le and slipped\n66 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nout of the FBI\u2019s usable institutional memory. It became an unknownknown.\nGiven the tyranny of the case \ufb01le, suppose \u2013 as a senior FBI coun-\nterterrorism agent posed it to me \u2013 the FBI had done better at con-necting the dots about \ufb02ying lessons in the summer of 2001. Hisaccount is self-serving but with merit. What could the FBI have done?No crime had yet been committed because taking \ufb02ying lessons is nota crime, not even for Middle Easterners and not even if they are unin-terested in landings and takeoffs. Suppose, then, that the FBI hadstarted knocking on doors of \ufb02ight schools asking to interview Mid-dle Eastern students \u2013 all without a crime or case. How far would ithave gotten, at a time when Justice was suing local police departmentsover racial pro\ufb01ling? The question is a haunting reminder of the forceof the Cold War distinctions and of the law enforcement mission ofthe FBI.\nbarons, agents, and furniture\nAfter I left government (for a third time), I had the opportunity tolead a RAND Corporation project that, at the urging of Congress,reviewed the internal-security procedures at the Bureau in the wakeof a Soviet spy, Robert Hanssen, in the FBI and of a blue-ribbon panelchaired by former FBI (and CIA) director, Judge William Webster, torecommend reforms.\n23I had known the FBI before September 11 but\nit was from the perspective of intelligence, not law enforcement, whichat that time was the FBI\u2019s preeminent mission. In those days, the anal-ogy with place-kickers in the National Football League was apt: they,like intelligence of\ufb01cers at the FBI, were important in substance butnot very high in the organization\u2019s pecking order.\nSo, this opportunity was a fascinating exposure to a very different\norganizational culture. My \ufb01rst day of conducting interviews at theBureau drove home just how different it was. I was interviewing theof\ufb01cer in charge of the FBI\u2019s asset and informant database, sensitiveinformation. She was an agent, impressive and vocal about how muchshe hated being at FBI headquarters. She wanted to be back out onthe streets catching bad guys. Later in the day, I complimented her toanother agent who had been her boss at the Washington \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce.His response was a reminder of just how different this culture was.\nThe Cold War Legacy 67\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d he said, \u201cshe\u2019s terri\ufb01c. She\u2019s the best fugitive tracker in theBureau. And she can put the entire contents of her sidearm through atarget the size of a donut.\u201d This was not the kind of compliment onewas likely to receive at the RAND Corporation!\nI mused about why the FBI was the most headquarters-phobic gov-\nernment organization I had ever encountered, easily surpassing eventhe military on that dimension. It \ufb01nally hit me: bad guys did not getcollared at headquarters \u2013 or so we profoundly hoped! \u2013 but ratheronly in the \ufb01eld. As long as the FBI was preeminently in the lawenforcement business, literally nothing of value was accomplished atheadquarters. Intelligence is different in that sense because althoughcollection abroad is critical, most analysis happens if not at headquar-ters, then in Washington, policy of\ufb01cials are briefed there, and so on.For intelligence, much of value occurs at headquarters, and somethingof value happens at headquarters even for the military in planning,training, and the like.\nThe old FBI was not just headquarters-phobic, it was also \u2013 not\nsurprisingly \u2013 radically decentralized. The Special Agents in Charge(SACs) of \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces were barons in their domain. As MaureenBaginski, who came from NSA to become the FBI\u2019s Executive Associ-ate Director (EAD) for Intelligence, said: \u201cI\u2019d known barons abroad \u2013the CIA station chiefs in foreign countries \u2013 but the experience ofbarons at home was a new one for me.\u201d As an example of just howdecentralized it was, many agents in the New York \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce dis-trusted the Bureau\u2019s workhorse information system, the AutomatedCase Support (ACS) system, and simply refused to upload materialto it.\nIn the words of the Webster blue-ribbon panel, several agents\nbelieved \u201cthat it is possible to ascertain user passwords by employingACS system tools\u201d and that the system\u2019s features have \u201cresulted in anumber of horror stories about exposure of con\ufb01dential \ufb01les on ACS.\u201dTherefore, \u201cpersonnel charged with investigating espionage allega-tions generally do not upload case \ufb01le information into ACS ...[and]\ndo not even solicit help with leads on ACS because on one occasion,when a lead was sent to a \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce, new agents who covered thelead \u2013 unaware of the unit\u2019s avoidance of ACS [and how ACS\ufb01le restrictions operate] \u2013 uploaded information without restrict-ing it.\u201d\n24\n68 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThat culture is powerful and it pervades the entire organization,\nre\ufb02ected at every level and in every area. It contributed to theautonomous, decentralized authority and traditions of the \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces,which also are sharper in the FBI than in any other government orga-nization I have known. Before September 11, money was allocatedand careers were made through criminal investigations, not long-termanalysis or other work. \u201cIntelligence\u201d in the Bureau\u2019s practice was tipsto \ufb01nding and catching evildoers; it was not the assembling of a broadmosaic of understanding. Producing clear, evidence-based narrativesthat would indict criminals was prized; drawing \u201ciffy\u201d inferences basedon fragmentary information in order to support decision making wasnot. Given a choice between more agents on the street and bettertechnology, the culture opted for the former, resulting in the FBI\u2019sfamously backward technology. It is, in the words of one investigator,\u201cwhere the [IBM] 360s went to die\u201d \u2013 or, as an FBI agent told me,\u201cWe took the dirt-road alternative to the information superhighway ageneration ago.\u201d\nIn my work after September 11, reinforcing security at the FBI\namounted to changing its organizational culture, and September 11required yet another culture change. The culture was one in whichsecurity, other than physical security, was not a top priority. Althoughthe distinctions have softened over time, still the gap between spe-cial agents and \u201csupport\u201d is yawning. As Baginski said to me on oneoccasion: \u201cI\u2019ve been told that there are two kinds of people at theBureau. There are agents, and there is furniture. I may have a fancytitle, but I\u2019m still furniture.\u201d Activities, like intelligence, that werenot primarily performed by agents have been given less priority andfewer resources, never mind whether those other activities are \ufb01l-ing, or doing science, or analyzing intelligence. Stated more crudely,if you did not carry a gun at the Bureau, as agents do, you were asecond-class citizen. Technical security was not fully appreciated orsupported. Personnel security was seen as an administrative func-tion. The combination of emphasis on law enforcement and the roleof agents argued against compartmentalizing information. \u201cNeed toknow\u201d was not applied in the same sense that it is meant to be appliedelsewhere in the government. Even when there existed reasons to doso, the information-technology (IT) systems in place meant that therewas not always the means to do so.\nThe Cold War Legacy 69\nIndeed, reinforcing security was a change in culture within a change\nin culture because the shift toward counterterrorism was changing theFBI\u2019s mission and, with it, its culture. In the long run, that changein mission made the approach of the Webster Commission, whichessentially applied an intelligence-agency template for security to theFBI, all the more appropriate. Yet, in the short term, the Bureau wasand is being tugged in two directions, characterized by insiders in theearly 2000s as \u201cWebster\u201d and \u201c9\u201311.\u201d While the former argues forbeing more careful with and compartmentalizing information, the lat-ter creates enormous pressure to get on with the job and to shareinformation widely in doing so. Even so, there are good reasons inlaw enforcement to restrict access to certain types of information.There needs to be a comprehensive and deliberate approach to infor-mation management that enables the work and work processes ofthe FBI.\nterrorism and preemptive prosecution\nIn many respects, counterterrorism bridges the two classic Bureaumissions \u2013 criminal law enforcement and counterintelligence \u2013 ref-lected in the work of the Criminal Investigative Division (CID) andthe CD. CID informants, for instance, are themselves criminals whoare likely to commit unauthorized crimes. Thus, the premium in han-dling them is to get their tips, then move them quickly out of thechain of evidence by running an FBI operation. By contrast, while CDassets may commit crimes, many of them are \u201cwhite-collar spies,\u201d whomay provide valuable intelligence throughout a considerable periodof working for the Bureau. Persons of interest to the CTD mightbe either; that is, they might provide valuable intelligence even asthey commit unauthorized crimes, such as running guns or launder-ing money.\nIn that sense, countering terrorism, especially at home, has much in\ncommon with operations against drug traf\ufb01ckers and organized crime.The intelligence task for all three puts a premium on unraveling net-works, which often span countries and continents. The main differ-ence, it is often observed, is that criminals want to live for their cause(i.e., money), not die for it. They want to live to steal another day.Some terrorists, by contrast, are prepared to die for their cause.\n70 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThat fact drives the intelligence task back to prevention, or pre-\nemption. That, in turn, produces another major difference between\ufb01ghting terrorists and \ufb01ghting crime: because potential terrorists,especially homegrown terrorists, must be stopped before they strike,the decision to roll up the operation has to come much earlier. Indeed,drug dealers and other criminals need to be allowed to commit theircrimes so that they can be prosecuted. However, the consequences areusually modest; a drug shipment, for instance, might be seized after it\nwas sold and the crime thus committed.\nTerrorists, however, cannot be allowed to strike and therefore need\nto be found and stopped before they do. Combating them becomeswhat might be called preemptive prosecution and, like other preemp-tive strikes, it is risky. It means relying on often unreliable infor-mants to in\ufb01ltrate insular communities, and it means making arrestsbefore anything close to a terrorist attack actually happens. The pro-cess sometimes will end with a prosecution but often without a convic-tion \u2013 there is a slender record of U.S. convictions of terrorists sinceSeptember 11. The process is a messy and unsatisfying ordeal, but itmay be the best that can be done.\nThe Fort Dix case of 2007 is an illustration.\n25The principal infor-\nmant, Mahmoud Omar, a legal immigrant from Egypt, had been con-victed of bank fraud and served time. In 2002, the government triedand failed to deport him, and two years later it tried again. The sameyear the government made a third try, 2006, the FBI put Omar onthe payroll, and the immigration case quietly went away. He in\ufb01l-trated a group of friends in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, who the govern-ment suspected of harboring terrorist intentions. For sixteen months,Omar earned thousands of dollars recording hundreds of conversa-tions. According to court documents, he drove one man to do surveil-lance of possible targets and he offered to help buy illegal weaponsfor the group. Finally, in 2007, Omar handed over the men, thereafterknown as the \u201cFort Dix Six.\u201d\nIn May 2006, when the U.S. attorney announced the arrests on\nthe steps of the courthouse in Camden, New Jersey, he called theFort Dix case \u201cthe model for the post\u2013September 11 era.\u201d He meantthat as a compliment. Eight different law enforcement agencies hadcooperated, all of them following up on the tip of a concerned citi-zen. The investigation had run for a long time, eighteen months. Six\nThe Cold War Legacy 71\nsuspects were in jail: \ufb01ve charged with conspiring to kill soldiers atthe Fort Dix military base in southern New Jersey and the sixth fac-ing weapons charges. No one had gotten hurt. \u201cThis,\u201d said the attor-ney, \u201cis what we\u2019ve been talking about developing since [Septem-ber 11].\u201d\nThe \ufb01rst tip had indeed come from a citizen, a store clerk at a Cir-\ncuit City store where three of those arrested \u2013 brothers \u2013 went to getan 8-mm video converted to a DVD. The clerk thought nothing wasout of the ordinary as he copied the video until he noticed beardedmen in camou\ufb02age shooting guns and shouting in a foreign language.After thinking about it overnight, he then called the police.\nThe police took the tip seriously and reviewed the tape. They were\nstruck by the words jihad and Allahu Akbar (which means \u201cGod is\ngreat\u201d); however, those words are ambiguous because they are usedby many devout and law-abiding Muslims the way Christians mightsay, \u201cPraise God\u201d or \u201cGod bless.\u201d The men in the video plainly likedguns, but was it what the government has termed a \u201cmilitia-like\u201dtraining?\nAs terrorism domesticates, the pro\ufb01le of a would-be terrorist is\nbecoming increasingly less obvious. Most homegrown terrorism plotsare the work of \u201cunremarkable men,\u201d as a 2007 report on radical-ization by the New York Police Department (NYPD) stated it, or \u201cagroup of guys,\u201d as U.S. intelligence of\ufb01cials call them. In those circum-stances, intelligence has to be attentive to minor behaviors. Forinstance, one month before the July 7, 2005, London transit bomb-ings, two of the suicide bombers went whitewater rafting together. Adecade earlier, the Circuit City tape might have been ignored as just\u201cguys with guns\u201d; in 2006, it was not.\nEnter the informant, Omar. Just as America\u2019s spies are foreigners,\nnot U.S. of\ufb01cials, informants also are not undercover FBI agents \u2013quite the contrary. The FBI has very few agents who can pass as youngMuslim extremists. Therefore, most informants are people who, likeOmar, need something badly enough that the government has a han-dle on them. Usually, they need money or a way to reduce their prisonsentences or to avoid deportation. Many have criminal records; theJustice Department\u2019s Inspector General (IG) reported in 2005 that10 percent of a sampling of informants had committed new, unautho-rized crimes while working for the FBI.\n72 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nOmar was hired by the FBI to ingratiate himself with the men in\nthe Circuit City video, and he did his job persistently if not alwaysgracefully, returning repeatedly to a shop owned by the family of oneof those ultimately arrested. The family had immigrated to the UnitedStates from Jordan. The three brothers who were arrested were illegalimmigrants from the former Yugoslavia, who looked and sounded likeAmericans.\nOmar recorded more than 100 hours of his conversations with those\nlater arrested, but still the amount of information is minimal. Most ofthe conversations were the tedious chatter of young men, more about\ufb01shing or Fords than jihad. The most damning statements seem to\nhave come from one man when he was alone with Omar, allegedlysaying, \u201cIf you want to do anything here, there is Fort Dix and I don\u2019twant to exaggerate, and I assure you that you can hit an Americanb a s ev e r ye a s i l y ....W h e ny o ug ot oam ilitary base, you need mortars\nand RPGs.\u201d The language is ominous but could also be interpretedas a response to Omar. At another point, the man said, \u201cI am at yourservices as you have more experience than me in military bases andin life,\u201d while at another time he is more assertive. As he and Omartraveled to Fort Dix and other military bases to conduct surveillance,he said, \u201cMy intent is to hit a heavy concentration of soldiers.\u201d\nInformants are almost by de\ufb01nition not entirely reliable, so they\nare closely monitored. However, tape recorders and other recordingdevices not only can be turned off, they also malfunction often. More-over, on one occasion, Omar gave his handler false information inorder to protect a friend. Informants \u2013 and the baggage that oftencomes with them \u2013 are not new. What is new is the heavy reliance oninformants in terrorism cases. In drug cases, after all, no one usuallygets arrested until someone actually has drugs. Terrorism cases aremore dif\ufb01cult. If an informant or source comes back with a kilo ofcocaine, the case is quite clear; in a terrorism case, if he outlines whatthe group is planning, it is only his word.\nTherefore, again and again, accused terrorists have argued that\nthey were entrapped. They did so in the Fort Dix case, althoughentrapment is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to prove. Harder evidence is inshort supply. The father of one of those arrested owned a pizzeriaand had a map of the base and clearance to deliver there. The mapfound its way into the group\u2019s hands. Court documents do not contain\nThe Cold War Legacy 73\nevidence of a speci\ufb01c date or a detailed plan. Perhaps the direstcharges are that three of those arrested wanted to buy fully automaticguns and went to Omar\u2019s apartment to get them. When they did, thepolice moved in and made the arrests. Meanwhile, Omar, the infor-mant, vanished.\nThe point is that prosecutions may not be the point; disrupting ter-\nrorist plots is. The risks, however, are that innocent people will go tojail on \ufb02imsy evidence or, on the \ufb02ip side, that juries will become soleery of dodgy informants that they will set guilty people free. Overthe longer term, the risk is that rumors of entrapment will become sopervasive that they will poison relations between the FBI and othergovernment agencies, as well as their best potential allies \u2013 the Mus-lim communities across the United States.\nThe question will remain how much the intelligence-agency tem-\nplate for the FBI will need to be adapted to an organization that willretain a powerful law enforcement past and continuing mission andthat will be moving toward more emphasis on a counterterrorism mis-sion that crosses intelligence and law enforcement. The new mission ismore proactive than the old, more centered on public safety by look-ing ahead to consequences and planning accordingly.\nThe agents are a \u201cband of brothers,\u201d now including many sisters.\nThat band makes for powerful capacity. As one agent told me, \u201cWhenyou go out the door on an operation, you don\u2019t have to look overyour shoulder to see if anyone is with you. They are.\u201d As with mostpowerful cultures, however, the pluses and minuses of the FBI cultureare the same attributes. Agents easily shared information within theband \u2013 perhaps too easily, as was suggested by Robert Hanssen, whonot only took advantage of the shortcomings of the ACS but was alsoallowed access to information he had no need to see. However, FBIagents were not distinguished before September 11 by their willing-ness to share outside the band. The Bureau brought and brings state\nand local police of\ufb01cers to work with it but does so primarily on itsterms, as members of FBI joint-task forces, with clearances to match.\nThe culture is powerful; it is a source of capacity to act in the pub-\nlic interest. However, changing it, like changing any powerful orga-nizational culture, is dif\ufb01cult and slow. The FBI culture prized \u2013 andprizes \u2013 action; it favored agents on the street over technology, tak-ing that dirt-road alternative to the information highway. It was and\n74 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nto a considerable but changing extent still is a culture of law enforce-ment, which puts a premium on sharing information, not closeting it.The \u201ccan do\u201d spirit of the organization makes the gap between head-quarters and the \ufb01eld more striking than for virtually any other gov-ernment organization. The question for the future is how much thislegacy needs to be changed \u2013 and how much it can be changed.\n4\nThe Imperative of Change\nIf the boundaries served the democratic nations tolerably well dur-ing the Cold War \u2013 in particular, by safeguarding the privacy of citi-zens \u2013 they set up those nations to fail in an age of terror. Terroristsrespected none of those boundaries. They were not \u201cover there\u201d \u2013they were both there and here, with the precise con\ufb01gurations chang-ing and unpredictable. By the mid-2000s, for instance, the terroristthreat to Britain was almost entirely \u201cdomestic\u201d \u2013 homegrown cellswith tentacles reaching abroad, to Pakistan in particular. By contrast,for the United States, the problem was still primarily \u201cover there,\u201dalthough with its tendrils reaching into the United States. Whetherthat would change remained to be seen \u2013 and remained a task forintelligence in an age of terror.\nTerrorists targeted not armies but rather private citizens. As a\nresult, the so-called war on terrorism not only hyped the threat butalso mislocated it, implying that military instruments, in which theUnited States reigned supreme, would be primary. While those ter-rorists might commit crimes, they might commit only one, and then itwould be too late. They could not be dealt with as either an intelli-gence or a law enforcement problem; rather, they had to be treated asboth.\nBy the same token, if organizing intelligence \u2013 on the collection\nside, by source, and on the analysis side, by agency \u2013 may have madea certain sense during the Cold War, it cannot be the right way to orga-nize now. On the collection side, if the terrorist target is more of a mys-tery than a puzzle, then the Cold War\u2019s implicit competition amongthe INTs for puzzle pieces needs to give way to explicit cooperation\n75\n76 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nacross those INTs in framing the mysteries. Moreover, it is not justthat now there are more targets but also more consumers and moreinformation \u2013 although it is information varied in reliability and littleof it \u201cowned\u201d by intelligence as were the Cold War secret sources.\nIn the United States, the 2004 Act made a start at reshaping intel-\nligence. It \u2013 and more so the Senate version of the bill that was mod-i\ufb01ed in conference \u2013 proposed national intelligence centers under theauthority of the new DNI and organized around issues or missions.The national intelligence centers, with the National Counterterror-ism Center (NCTC) as the prototype, would both deploy and use theinformation, technology, and staff resources of the existing agencies \u2013the CIA, DIA, NSA, and others. The centers would be intelligence\u2019sversion of the military\u2019s \u201cuni\ufb01ed combatant commands,\u201d looking tothe agencies to acquire the technological systems, train the people,and execute the operations planned by the centers. So far, in additionto the NCTC, the National Counterproliferation Center is the onlyother center to have been established, and it does not have the opera-tional role of the NCTC.\nAt the same time, the FBI, under Director Mueller, was under enor-\nmous pressure, and there was considerable talk of creating a newdomestic-intelligence agency apart from the Bureau. Mueller, how-ever, moved rapidly to turn the Bureau from almost pure concen-tration on law enforcement to prevention and intelligence. BothCongress and the postmortem commissions decided to give the FBItime to see if the change could be made enduring. The FBI adoptedthe WMD Commission\u2019s recommendation to create not only a Direc-torate of Intelligence within the FBI but also the National SecurityBranch (NSB), incorporating intelligence plus the FBI\u2019s Counterter-rorism and Counterintelligence Divisions (CTD and CD).\nhitting the \u201cwall\u201d\nThe effect of all the Cold War boundaries was vividly on display in therun-up to September 11.\n1By the spring of 2000, two of the hijackers,\nKhalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, were living under their ownnames in San Diego, and the latter even applied for a new visa. TheINS had no reason to be concerned because the CIA had withheldthe two terrorists names from TIPOFF, the basic terrorist watch list.\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 77\nNeither did the FBI have any reason to look for them \u2013 for instance,by conducting a basic Internet search for their names or by queryingits informants in Southern California \u2013 because the last it knew fromthe CIA was that the two terrorists were overseas. No agency told theFAA to be on alert for the two, apparently because it was not in thelaw enforcement business. The airlines were not informed becausethey were private, not public.\nAccording to the joint Senate\u2013House investigation of September\n11, the CIA\u2019s procedures for informing other agencies \u2013 FBI, State,NSA, and the then-INS \u2013 of suspected terrorists were both restrictedand haphazard.\n2By its own guidelines and later by a January 2001\nmemorandum of understanding, the CIA was supposed to notify atleast the FBI and the NSA of all people it suspected to be terrorists. Infact, the CIA seems only to have put people on the watch list if it alsohad information that they were about to travel to the United States \u2013a more restrictive criterion. Moreover, in the investigation\u2019s words,the CIA \u201capparently neither trained nor encouraged its employees tofollow its own rules on watchlisting.\u201d The number of names the CIAput on the watch list soared after September 11 \u2013 from 1,761 duringthe three months before September 11 to 4,251 in the three monthsafterward.\nThe ragged connections between the CIA and the FBI were graph-\nically illustrated by their misdealings over the Al Qaeda\u2013af\ufb01liated ter-rorists, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. The saga of what the two agenciestold one another, and when, was played out in the series of investiga-tions of the September 11 tragedy.\n3The two men attended a terrorist\nmeeting in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in early January 2000. This meet-ing was known to and surveilled by the CIA, which already knew thatal-Mihdhar possessed a multiple-entry visa permitting him to travel tothe United States. The NSA had independent information that linkedal-Hazmi to Al Qaeda. Neither the CIA nor the NSA, however, saw \ufb01tto provide those names for the main watch list, the so-called TIPOFFdatabase.\nThere was some initial confusion about what the CIA told the FBI\nregarding al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi. CIA e-mail traf\ufb01c reviewed bythe joint congressional investigation, however, suggests that the CIAbriefed the FBI in general terms. The 9/11 Commission\u2019s accountindicated that a CIA analyst had passed the surveillance photographs\n78 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nto an FBI analyst working in the USS Cole Investigation Unit. The\nCIA, however, still did not bother to tell the FBI that al-Mihdhar hada multiple-entry visa that would allow him to enter the United States.In early March 2000, the CIA learned that al-Hazmi had arrived inLos Angeles on January 15. Despite having just learned of the pres-ence in this country of an Al Qaeda terrorist, the CIA apparentlydid not inform other agencies. Indeed, the internal cable transmittingthis information contained the notation: \u201cAction Required: None,FYI.\u201d This information came hard on the heels of the intelligencecommunity\u2019s alarm over possible \u201cmillennium plots\u201d by Al Qaeda.Moreover, Al-Hazmi arrived at about the same time the CIA knewthat Al Qaeda terrorist, Ahmed Ressam, was also supposed to havearrived in Los Angeles to conduct terrorism operations. Still, how-ever, the CIA refused to notify anyone of al-Hazmi\u2019s presence in thecountry.\nBy this point, al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi \u2013 both of them terror-\nists known to the CIA \u2013 were living in San Diego under their realnames. They signed these names on their rental agreement, both usedtheir real names in taking \ufb02ight-school training in May 2000, and al-Mihdhar even used his real name to obtain a motor-vehicle iden-ti\ufb01cation card from the State of California. In July 2000, al-Hazmiapplied to the INS for an extension of his visa, sending in the appli-cation using his real name and his current address in San Diego(where he would remain until December 2000). INS had no rea-son to be concerned because the CIA had not put their names onTIPOFF, and the last the FBI had heard from the CIA the two wereoverseas.\nThe CIA\u2019s failure to put al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi on the watch list\nbecame even more inexplicable in January 2001, when the CIA dis-covered that a suspect in the USS Cole bombing also had attended\nthe Malaysia meeting. This might have been taken as con\ufb01rma-tion that the two terrorists had links to Al Qaeda operational cells,thus making them even more a concern, but the CIA still did notbother to inform TIPOFF. This failure was particularly damagingbecause al-Mihdhar was overseas at the time; putting his name onthe watch list would have enabled INS agents to stop him at theborder.\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 79\nEven when given the opportunity to tell the FBI \u2013 in face-to-face\nmeetings \u2013 about the presence of the two terrorists in the UnitedStates, the CIA refused. The 9/11 Commission report describes thesequence, using only \ufb01rst names for the of\ufb01cials involved: John, CIAof\ufb01cial \u2013 International Terrorism Operations Section; Dave, CIA ana-lyst; Jane, FBI analyst \u2013 FBI\u2019s USS Cole Investigation Unit; Mary, FBI\nanalyst \u2013 detailed to the CIA\u2019s Bin Laden Unit.\n4John had given the\nthree surveillance photographs of the Kuala Lumpur meeting to Janeto show to FBI New York agents. She received no more informationregarding the photographs.\nOn June 11, 2001, Dave, Jane, and the USS Cole case agents met\nin New York to discuss information and to share the surveillancephotographs of Kuala Lumpur. Because the CIA never disseminatedreports on its tracking of al-Mihdhar, Jane was prevented from pullingany information on his visa or travel to the United States. For his part,Dave told investigators that as a CIA analyst, he was not authorizedto answer questions from the FBI about the CIA information dur-ing the June 11 meeting. Thus, he resisted telling his FBI counterpartswhat he knew \u2013 that al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi had come to the UnitedStates. The FBI agents left the meeting without learning any informa-tion that would initiate an investigation on al-Mihdhar.\nThere was additional contact between the two agencies. For\ninstance, John contacted Mary to review the Kuala Lumpur materialsanother time. Yet, Dave stated to investigators that NSA reports thatcontained information on Mihdhar could not be shared with criminalinvestigators without permission of the Justice Department\u2019s OIPR.This stopped Jane from passing information to the FBI agents whowere most knowledgeable about Al Qaeda. When Jane drafted a leadon information regarding al-Mihdhar, one agent, who worked on theUSS Cole case, contacted her after reading the lead with interest. In\nthe words of the 9/11 Commission report: \u201c\u2018Jane\u2019 later insisted, how-ever, that because the agent was designated a \u2018criminal\u2019 FBI agent,not an intelligence FBI agent, the wall kept him from participating inany search for al-Mihdhar.\u201d\n5\nMeanwhile, al-Mihdhar, in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, applied for a new\nU.S. visa in June 2001. However, because neither he nor al-Hazmiwas on the TIPOFF list, his name did not appear when the State\n80 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nDepartment of\ufb01cials who took this application checked his nameagainst their database, which incorporated TIPOFF watch list infor-mation. Therefore, al-Mihdhar was given a visa and returned unchal-lenged to the United States in July.\nThe CIA \ufb01nally put al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar on the watch list in\nlate August 2001, by which point they were already in the UnitedStates and in the \ufb01nal stages of preparing for the September 11 at-tacks; the CIA also added the names of two others who were expectedto try and enter the United States. Apparently, the FBI did littlewith the information and also failed to share it with the INS until theINS had already admitted the other two into the country. Questionedabout its failure to follow up on this cable, one FBI of\ufb01cial said, \u201cIf thecable says, \u201cDon\u2019t let them in the country, and they were already inthe country, what\u2019s the point of bringing this up now?\u201d In any event,the FBI failed to locate Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, whohijacked the jet that crashed into the Pentagon on September 11.\nThe FBI tried to \ufb01nd the two terrorists but was hampered by a\ncombination of its own regulations and the prevailing view that terror-ism was a second-order mission, especially in the United States. TheBureau did not shift agents to counterterrorism from its primary lawenforcement mission. Neither did it search the Web for informationthat would have revealed al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar living under theirreal names in San Diego. On October 18, the Los Angeles Times re-\nported that a simple check of public records and addresses through theCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles would have disclosed thecorrect location of the two hijackers. A check with credit card compa-nies would have shown airline-ticket purchases and given their correctaddresses.\n6(According to testimony before the congressional investi-\ngation from an FBI agent in New York, who also conducted such asearch after the September 11 attacks, \ufb01nding al-Mihdhar\u2019s addresscould have been accomplished \u201cwithin hours.\u201d) The Bureau also didnot ask for help from Treasury of\ufb01cials in tracking down al-Mihdharand al-Hazmi through their credit card or banking transactions.\nA State Department of\ufb01cial testi\ufb01ed that the FBI had refused for\na decade to provide the INS with access to its National Crime Infor-mation Center Database, on the grounds that the INS is not a \u201clawenforcement\u201d organization. Nevertheless, an internal FBI review con-cluded that \u201ceverything was done that could have been done.\u201d\n7\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 81\nBefore September 11, the \u201cstandard FBI line\u201d \u2013 according to onesource who spoke to New Yorker writer Joe Klein \u2013 was that \u201cOsama\nbin Laden wasn\u2019t a serious domestic security threat,\u201d presumablybecause his earlier attacks had been abroad, not at home.\n8\nNo agency told the FAA to be on the alert for the four men, appar-\nently because it too was not in the law enforcement business. Theairlines were not informed because they were private, not public. AEuropean of\ufb01cial testi\ufb01ed to the effect of these oppositions on thesharing of information with the United States: \u201cThose we have beenarresting are people we knew about before [September 11] but neverthought were particularly dangerous to us inside our national bound-aries.\u201d\n9So, the two hijackers \ufb02ew their plane into the Pentagon on\nSeptember 11, 2001.\n\ufb01rst steps at reform\nIn an unusual move for a blue-ribbon panel, the 9/11 Commission tookthe reshaping of American intelligence into new territory. Its reportwas dramatic and made several recommendations \u2013 primarily toreshape the organization of U.S. intelligence but also to begin tochange the way it does business. Even more unusual for a blue-ribbonpanel, the 9/11 Commission did not report and then disappear; rather,it stayed around, hectoring both Congress and the Bush administra-tion to actually make something happen.\nThe 9/11 victims\u2019 families added political clout to the Commission\nbecause they were not about to be ignored. Were it not for them, theCommission may not have been established in the \ufb01rst place. Once itwas established, the families fought hard for public hearings and foraccess to President Bush by the Commission, and they helped withthe lobbying after the report was released. The result was the Decem-ber 2004 bill creating a DNI; veteran diplomat, John Negroponte, wasappointed the \ufb01rst DNI in February 2005, reportedly after severalother candidates had either turned down the job or removed them-selves from the running.\nThe 9/11 Commission made six broad proposals affecting intelli-\ngence and therefore is a good benchmark for assessing what has beenaccomplished to date. The WMD Commission, which reported afterthe bill had been enacted, extended the agenda of reform. Neither\n82 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ncommission called for a domestic-intelligence service separate fromthe FBI. Both, and especially the 9/11 Commission, underscored anenormous challenge, one that is the work of years, not weeks ormonths: the need to not only create the technical infrastructure to bet-ter share intelligence but also to rethink the web of \u201cneed to know\u201dand other security requirements that frustrate sharing. The 9/11 Com-mission\u2019s principal recommendations were to\nrcreate the position of a DNI, located in the White House and pos-sessing what the preexisting DCI did nothave \u2013 real authority over\nthe budgets of the \ufb01fteen U.S. intelligence agencies\nrinstitute an NCTC reporting to the DNI, responsible for both jointoperational planning andjoint intelligence\nrestablish national intelligence centers, organized around discreteissues on the model of the NCTC, under the authority of the DNI\nrmake the CIA director a position separate from the DNI andcharge him or her primarily with building a better espionage capac-ity for the nation\nrset focal points for oversight in both the House and the Senate,for both intelligence and homeland security, in place of the eighty-eight committees and subcommittees of Congress before whichDHS of\ufb01cials now appear\nrrethink the web of \u201cneed to know\u201d and other security proceduresthat frustrate not just sharing intelligence but also intelligence workas a whole\nrnotcreate a separate domestic-intelligence service after the model\nof the British MI-5; instead, it encouraged the FBI to move forwardwith changing its mission from pure law enforcement to terrorismprevention and building a DI within the existing FBIThe \ufb01rst four recommendations were embodied \u2013 albeit in differ-\ning degrees \u2013 in the December 2004 bill. The measure that receivedthe most press attention \u2013 creating a DNI \u2013 was the most familiar. Themost far-reaching, however, was the 9/11 Commission\u2019s proposal tofoster coordination by emulating the military in separating the \u201corga-nize, train, and equip\u201d function from the actual deployment of intelli-gence personnel. The existing agencies \u2013 CIA, FBI, DIA, and NSA \u2013would, like the military services, be responsible for building the intelli-\ngence forces, but those forces would be deployed by the new \u201cnational\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 83\nintelligence centers,\u201d which would be shaped by issue or function, notas currently by organization or collection source.\nThose centers would be intelligence\u2019s equivalent of the military\u2019s\nuni\ufb01ed commands. In Iraq, for instance, it was Central Command(CENTCOM) that conducted the war; the troops were provided bythe military services, which executed operations under CENTCOM\u2019sdirection. By analogy, the National Counterterrorism Center wouldbe the \u201cuni\ufb01ed command\u201d in the war on terrorism, conducting theintelligence analysis and planning operations. The CIA and otheragencies would provide the analysts and other personnel and wouldconduct the required operations \u2013 for instance, intelligence-gathering.Issue-oriented centers have existed in the intelligence communitysince the mid-1980s. Although in form, like the preexisting CTC, thesecenters worked for the DCI; in fact, they were dominated by the CIA.This proposal moved them to the DNI and, in principle, made themmore central as focal points for intelligence and operations.\nPredictably, the sticking point in the \ufb01nal congressional negotia-\ntions was the exact power of the DNI over the intelligence operationslocated in the Defense Department, especially the major technicalcollectors \u2013 the NSA, the NGA, and the NRO. Those agencies areresponsible for the majority of the national intelligence budget, andno secretary of defense has been eager to cede authority over themto the DCI or the new DNI. By all accounts, Secretary of DefenseRumsfeld in 2004 was no exception.\nThe Senate passed a bill similar to the 9/11 Commission recom-\nmendations; however, the House version, although it created a DNI,endowed that position with less authority than the Senate bill. In con-ference, the House achieved many of its objectives.\n10Table 4.1 sum-\nmarizes the key issues of contention, the Senate version, the Houseversion, and the \ufb01nal outcome.\nThe most important of these eleventh-hour negotiations were the\nlimits on the key powers of the DNI \u2013 to move money and people.Exactly how important those limitations will turn out to be is still awork in progress; Negroponte\u2019s term as DNI left it unclear whetherthe limitations were substantial or whether he simply was disinclinedto try to stretch them. In principle, the DNIs have considerableprogrammatic authority: they develop the National Intelligence Pro-gram (NIP) and broad personnel policy across (civilians in) all the\n84 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 4.1.

In that sense, the DNI\u2019s authority over the nation\u2019s intelli-gence budget is roughly comparable to that of the secretary of defenseover total defense spending.\nThe limitations on DNI authority are more apparent at the level\nofexecution \u2013 for instance, the DNI was restricted from moving\nmore than 100 people to any particular new joint intelligence center.Beyond the 100, the DNI, like the DCI before him, has to bargainwith the other agency heads. The 5 percent limit also applies to theDNIs\u2019 authority to reprogram budgeted money without congressional\napproval. To be sure, 5 percent of a major agency budget is a lot ofmoney, especially in the context of the DNI\u2019s programming author-ity.\n11Still, the task for Negroponte and his successors was and is to\nturn a hunting license into real authority.\nassessing the main provisions\nThe \ufb01rst three recommendations embodied in the December 2004 billare the heart of the new approach, seeking coordination, or \u201cjoint-ness,\u201d at two levels: (1) the strategic, by breaking down the \u201cstove-pipes\u201d that made the separate agencies \u2013 especially the big collectingagencies \u2013 baronies in their own right; and (2) the day-to-day, by usingthe national intelligence centers to improve the operational manage-ment of intelligence. The \ufb01rst three recommendations formed a clus-ter, one that could not be easily disentangled, and had an either/orquality to them; therefore, half measures in implementation couldwind up being worse than nothing at all.\nCreate a Director of National Intelligence\nThe DNI is charged with overseeing national intelligence centers onspeci\ufb01c subjects of interest across the U.S. government, managing theNIP, and overseeing the agencies that contribute to it. The logic of theidea was to give the DNI what the position of DCI lacked: authorityover budgets for intelligence agencies other than the CIA, over hiringand \ufb01ring senior leaders, and over setting standards for intelligence\u2019spersonnel and infrastructure.\nAs usual in government, the proposition that DCIs had lacked\nauthority to manage the entire national-intelligence budget was not\n86 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nquite as clear-cut as the discussion implied. As many wise veteransobserved, the earlier authorities of the DCI could have been enoughhad presidents so desired \u2013 and so ordered of their secretaries ofdefense. In the Carter administration, when intelligence budgets werefalling, the DCI, Admiral Stans\ufb01eld Turner, exercised more controlover the entire budget, and he built a serious program-analysis staffto aid him in the effort. Still, the 2004 bill represented an increase inthe DCI\u2019s explicit authority.\nThe DNI replaces the DCI. The position is con\ufb01rmed by the\nSenate \u2013 as were Negroponte and his successor, retired Admiral MikeMcConnell \u2013 and the DNI testi\ufb01es before Congress. The DNI is nei-ther a member of the Cabinet nor has Cabinet rank. The 9/11 Commis-sion proposed to embody interagency cooperation by giving the DNIthree deputies, each of whom would also have had a second agencyresponsibility: foreign intelligence (i.e., the head of the CIA), defenseintelligence (i.e., the undersecretary of defense for intelligence), andhomeland intelligence (the FBI\u2019s EAD for intelligence or the under-secretary of homeland security for information analysis and infras-tructure protection). The December 2004 bill scrapped that arrange-ment, calling instead for a principal deputy director and up to fourother deputies with portfolios assigned by the DNI.\n12\nFor the \ufb01rst director, Negroponte, appointing a military person,\nGeneral Michael Hayden, director of the NSA, as principal deputyDNI was more than a nod to the Pentagon\u2019s concerns about the DNIposition. The \ufb01rst DNIs created four deputies in addition to the prin-cipal deputy \u2013 in 2007, for collection; analysis; acquisition; and policy,plans, and requirements. Another critical senior position \u2013 programmanager for the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) \u2013 alsoreported directly to the DNI.\nThe Defense Department\u2019s more strictly tactical intelligence pro-\ngrams (dubbed Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities, orTIARA, in \u201cbudgetese\u201d) \u2013 those that serve commands or \ufb01eld com-manders \u2013 always were slated to remain the Pentagon\u2019s responsibility.The Senate bill proposed to give the DNI authority over the JointMilitary Intelligence Program (JMIP), a set of tactical joint intelli-gence activities, some of which came from TIARA and some of whichwere performed by the NSA or the NGA\u2019s predecessor organizations.The \ufb01nal bill authorized the DNI to work with the secretary of defense\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 87\nin preparing both TIARA and JMIP budgets, which together total lessthan a quarter of the total intelligence budget.\nHere, as in other areas, the real challenge for the DNI only began\nwith formal authority. As the capabilities of \u201cnational\u201d collection sys-tems in the NIP have improved, they have become increasingly impor-tant to war\ufb01ghters for tactical purposes; thus, the distinction between\u201cstrategic\u201d and \u201ctactical\u201d has blurred.\n13Day-to-day, the overlap in-\ncreases the competition for resources if, for instance, the same satel-lite systems can locate insurgent combat units in Iraq for war\ufb01ght-ers as well as help keep tabs on suspicious nuclear facilities in Iranfor the bene\ufb01t of national policy makers. As a result, intelligence andthe Pentagon more often share assets; with that sharing, the competi-tion intensi\ufb01es over whose needs are more important \u2013 all the moreso because supporting war\ufb01ghters is an open-ended mission: more isalways better.\nThe risk of duplication also grows as the military seeks intelli-\ngence systems integral to operational units, those on which it cancount. Understandably, the war\ufb01ghters will want to control more ofthe systems they regard as necessary to waging war, even if they beganlife as \u201cnational\u201d systems. Ideally, they would like those systems tobe integral to military commands. The challenge for DNIs, workingwith secretaries of defense, will be to provide the strategic frameworkfor the argument over needs, thereby reducing the risk of needlessduplication.\nSome creative compromise over authority probably was always\ngoing to be required for those analytic agencies that would be impor-tant \u201ctroops\u201d for the DNI to deploy but that also have specialresponsibilities to particular departments. The State Department\u2019sINR, for instance, numbers only several hundred but often carriesweight beyond its size in interagency deliberations. Secretaries ofstate, however, are bound to regard the INR as their intelligence\nagency. The secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefsof Staff are likely to view the DIA similarly.\nThe law gave the DNI authority to appoint the director of the\nCIA. For all the other intelligence agency heads, except one, the DNIwas given a veto through the requirement that he or she concur inthe appointment made by the department head (e.g., defense, state,treasury, and so on) for whom the intelligence agency worked. The\n88 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nexception is the directorship of the DIA, where the law only gave theDNI a mandate to be consulted.\nCreating a DNI is hardly a new idea; it is more a hardy perennial.\n14\nIn an assessment of thirty-one studies of or proposals for reformingintelligence between 1948 and 2002, the top three recurring themeswere expanding the DCI\u2019s authority, creating a DNI, and giving theDCI more tools to manage the intelligence community.\n15\nThe 9/11 Commission did a clever job of linking the idea of a DNI\nto the September 11 failure. In fact, that case was relatively weak, forthose failures were more of coordination at the working level than ofbroad strategic direction. The bare fact that September 11 occurredwas enough to spur marked improvement in that day-to-day coordi-nation, along with a change in mission at the FBI. Whatever the linkor lack thereof, however, the need for better strategic management ofthe intelligence community is a pressing one. In the WMD Commis-sion\u2019s words, the community is \u201cfragmented, loosely managed, andpoorly coordinated.\u201d\n16\nOn the collection side, as has been emphasized, U.S. intelligence\u2019s\nlegacy from the Cold War is an organization by collection sources,or \u201cstovepipes\u201d \u2013 NSA for SIGINT, CIA for espionage, and so on.If, during the Cold War, that amounted to asking all the information-gatherers what they could contribute to solving the overarching puzzleof Soviet behavior, it cannot be the right way to organize U.S. intel-ligence now \u2013 with many threats, not one; a plethora of information,although of widely varying quality; and many customers. Given dif\ufb01-cult problems and arcane technology, plus a division of labor that gavecontrol of the purse strings to the Pentagon but ostensible oversightto the DCI, the stovepipe managers have had considerable autonomy.\nMoreover, once the retrieval times for gathering the information\nbecame short enough to make that information useful to battle-\ufb01eld commanders, the Pentagon incorporated the stovepipes into realoperational decision making that has made possible the pinpoint tar-geting of adversaries from afar. Strategic and tactical blurred, andit became still more dif\ufb01cult for the DCI to affect how technicalresources are allocated.\nThe case for ending the long mismatch between the responsibility\nof DCIs and their authority was a strong one. The drive to create aDNI was to accomplish that while serving as a counterbalance to therecent tendency of military consumers to dominate U.S. intelligence.\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 89\nThe question that remains to be seen is whether the December 2004bill really ends that mismatch and creates that counterbalance. DNIswill have a veto over the appointments of the main agency heads, andthey will have budgetary initiative and some authority over execution,as shown in Table 4.1.\nTo enhance the clout of the DNI, the 9/11 Commission recom-\nmended that the DNI be located in the Executive Of\ufb01ce of the Pres-ident. The December 2004 bill, however, directly stipulated that theDNI would notbe in the Executive Of\ufb01ce of the President. As always\nin political Washington, location bespeaks power and betrays perspec-tive. A DNI housed in the CIA headquarters would have made clearthat the CIA director was a subordinate but would have risked thatthe DNI would become a captive of the CIA, viewed as such. At theother extreme, a DNI housed with only a few subordinates at the OldExecutive Of\ufb01ce Building, next to the White House, would have beenclose to power but risked looking like drug czars in previous adminis-trations \u2013 long on title but short on troops. The \ufb01rst DNIs, Negroponteand McConnell, appointed in 2007, split the difference, although forreasons that had more to do with available space: they moved the DNIheadquarters \ufb01rst to the Defense Intelligence Agency Center (DIAC)at Bolling Air Force Base in southeast Washington, then to permanentquarters at Liberty Crossing in McLean, next to NCTC, but the NICand other of\ufb01ces remained at CIA headquarters.\nThe 9/11 Commission and the Senate bill endorsed making pub-\nlic the top lines of the U.S. intelligence budget, a move that is longoverdue. Detailed numbers would have remained secret, but the over-all budget allocations and the apportionment among agencies couldhave been safely disclosed without harm to intelligence\u2019s \u201csourcesand methods.\u201d Indeed, keeping them classi\ufb01ed when they are bandiedabout in the press only makes it look like the government has some-thing to hide. It became a shame that America lagged behind Britain \u2013the land of of\ufb01cial secrets \u2013 which makes its top-line budget num-bers known. It was well past time to end that shame.\n17When the\nDemocrats took over Congress in 2006, they moved to require at leastthe top line to be made public. DNI McConnell complied in Octo-ber 2007, making public that the budget for \ufb01scal year 2007 was $43.5billion.\n18\nThe main reason there was no DNI despite nearly \ufb01fty years of calls\nfor one is that none of the most critical of\ufb01cials wanted the change.19\n90 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nFor their part, DCIs had not wanted to trade their CIA troops forthe uncertain prospects of an intelligence overlord. Secretaries ofdefense \u2013 and their congressional overseers \u2013 had been loath to losecontrol of critical information-gathering agencies. When in the 1970sthe White House proposed to give control of the big technical collec-tors to the DCI, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld (then as later) is saidto have replied: \u201cIf they\u2019re in my budgets, I\u2019ll run them.\u201d\n20\nThe growing importance of those big intelligence collectors in the\nscheme of military transformation, if anything, probably increased thedefense establishment\u2019s opposition to giving control to the DNI. Ittook the shock of September 11 and the pull of the victims\u2019 families,the artful connecting by the 9/11 Commission of that failure with theneed for a DNI, and continued lobbying by the Commission membersto make the December 2004 bill happen.\nCreate an NCTC\nThe NCTC is responsible for both joint operational planning and jointintelligence.\n21The Terrorist Threat Integration Center (TTIC), cre-\nated in 2003, became the NCTC, or at least half of it. It became, ineffect, the NCTC\u2019s intelligence analysts. The bill left it to the NCTCto work out exactly what the planning task, labeled \u201cstrategic oper-ational planning,\u201d would entail and how it would work. The NCTC,like the TTIC before it, was to absorb analytic talent then residing inthe CIA\u2019s CTC, the FBI\u2019s CTD, and in the DIA\u2019s Joint Task ForceCounterterrorism (JTFCT).\nThe TTIC was created to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d of intelligence, both\nforeign and domestic, in warning of terrorist threats to the home-land. As it turned out, the personnel actually transferred to the NCTCwere relatively few. Many more were collocated by those agenciesat the NCTC. In effect, the TTIC, now the NCTC, was to become\u2013 on the intelligence side \u2013 the center of a confederation, with sev-eral hundred of\ufb01cials from the CIA\u2019s CTC and the FBI\u2019s CTD, plussmaller numbers from other agencies located at NCTC headquartersat Liberty Crossing near Tyson\u2019s Corner, Virginia, not far from CIAheadquarters. The NCTC became a kind of government terrorism\u201ccampus.\u201d\nOn the strategic operational planning side, the NCTC drew on\na limited inheritance. The CIA\u2019s CTC, for instance, from the start\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 91\nwas located with the CIA\u2019s clandestine operators, the Directorate ofOperations, and was more engaged in providing operational supportto intelligence operations abroad than it was in pure analysis. TheNCTC, however, as framed by the bill, was neither to execute opera-tions \u2013 those would be left to the agencies \u2013 nor to make policy, whichwould be left to the president and the NSC. It was to assign responsi-bilities for operations to lead agencies but not direct the execution ofthose operations.\nThe head of the NCTC is appointed by the president and con\ufb01rmed\nby the Senate. The DNI oversees the NCTC\u2019s operations and budget,and the director of the NCTC reports to the DNI on intelligence andintelligence operations. The NCTC director, however, reports to thepresident with regard to counterterrorism operations other than thosein intelligence. This dual reporting is probably necessary if the NCTCis to play a real role in planning the government\u2019s counterterrorismoperations, including those undertaken by the Pentagon. However, itruns the risk of further weakening the DNI position by dividing theloyalty of a principal subordinate.\nOn the positive side, the conception of the NCTC is rooted in the\nunderstanding that in an age of terror, the counterterrorism missionis intelligence-rich; thus, planning needs to be intelligence-driven. Ithas brought the interagency process in-house, with a permanent setof agency representatives \u2013 at about the one-star level \u2013 housed atthe NCTC. In general, the federal government achieves interagencycoordination in two ways: either designating a lead agency or pass-ing the coordinating responsibility to the White House \u2013 for instance,to the NSC. If an agency leads, it then constructs its own means ofachieving interagency coordination. The CTC at the CIA, for exam-ple, recruited liaison of\ufb01cers from throughout the intelligence commu-nity. The military\u2019s uni\ufb01ed CENTCOM has its own interagency intel-ligence center, recruiting liaison of\ufb01cers from all the agencies fromwhich it might need help. The FBI has joint terrorism task forces(JTTFs) in eighty-four locations to coordinate the activities of otheragencies when action may be required.\nThe December 2004 bill indicated a mix of coordination by the\nNCTC and by the White House, presumably the NSC but perhaps theHomeland Security Council.\n22The NCTC was to coordinate planning\nbut then turn execution over to lead agencies. The operational coor-dination presumably would be accomplished by some combination of\n92 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthose lead agencies and the NSC. In general, counterterrorism opera-tions tend to range across diplomatic, law enforcement, military, andintelligence instruments, thereby posing dif\ufb01cult challenges to coordi-nation \u2013 particularly to lead-agency coordination.\nThe \ufb01rst challenge for the director of the NCTC and the DNI was\nto sort out the turf battle between the NCTC (and the TTIC before)and the CTC. The WMD Commission pointed to this tug-of-war overresources, authorities, and responsibilities \u2013 a guerrilla war that hasraged since the creation of the TTIC. A division of labor is easyto imagine but has been dif\ufb01cult to reach. The CTC would concen-trate on support to operations while the NCTC focused on intelli-gence analysis and planning, and not all competition between the twoneed be negative. However, sorting out the roles of the two agencies,a \ufb01rst test of whether the DNI and his team were really in charge,remains inconclusive. Moreover, not only was it a work in progresswhat \u201cstrategic operational planning\u201d would mean in practice, thereach of NCTC planning into the operations of the major agencies,especially the military, also remains uncertain.\nCreate National Intelligence Centers\nWith the NCTC as the prototype, creating national intelligencecenters under the authority of the DNI and organized around issueswas the most sweeping change in the way intelligence does its businessproposed by the 9/11 Commission. The centers were to both deployand use the information, technology, and staff resources of the exist-ing agencies \u2013 the CIA, the DIA, the NSA, and others. They were tobe, in the 9/11 Commission\u2019s vision, the \u201cuni\ufb01ed commands\u201d lookingto the agencies to acquire the technological systems, train the peo-ple, and execute the operations planned by the national intelligencecenters. They were to bring together analysts, information collectors,and operations specialists around problems or issues, not collectionsources or agencies.\nThe 2004 bill licensed the creation of centers but had little to say\nabout those other than the NCTC. The idea was much less a center-piece of the bill than it had been of the 9/11 Commission report, whichhad suggested that they would be organized around a mix of func-tional and regional issues \u2013 WMD, crime, Russia and Eurasia, and the\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 93\nlike. At present, several centers, such as the existing CIA CTC, bringtogether of\ufb01cers from a number of intelligence agencies. The 9/11Commission\u2019s proposal would have intensi\ufb01ed these liaisons by mak-ing the national intelligence centers the primary way that the intelli-gence community does its work. Earlier centers were, and are, still thecreatures of the agencies; in the 9/11 Commission\u2019s proposal, the agen-cies were to become their supporters. Ideally, those who use intel-ligence would be drawn toward the centers and would know whereto go for \u201cone-stop shopping\u201d in their areas of interest in this age ofterror.\n23\nThere were and continue to be several lines of concern about an\norganization by centers, and the \ufb01rst DNIs did not encourage the idea.The \ufb01rst concern is that there is no real infrastructure to support theconcept, in technology or personnel. There is little tradition of intelli-gence of\ufb01cers moving and little incentive for them to do so \u2013 despitethe beginnings of DNI efforts to require of intelligence of\ufb01cers some-thing like the \u201cjoint\u201d appointments that are the prerequisite for seniorleadership in the military. The technical shortcomings are obvious atthe NCTC, where analysts\u2019 computers continued to be accompaniedby a half-dozen \u201cpizza boxes\u201d \u2013 that is, different agency informationsources that had to be integrated by the analysts.\nAlso on the capacity-building side, the major analytic agen-\ncies resist thinking of themselves as force providers; they regardthemselves as the doers. Well before 2004, the agencies expressedconcern about \u201ccenter-itis,\u201d the rise of numerous specialized or issue-oriented centers.\n24The agencies tended to think of personnel assigned\nto those centers as lost to the real work, which happened back homeat the agency. Changing that view to regard the real work as done bythe centers, with the agencies in a supporting role, will entail a seachange in organizational culture. It is interesting that the existing cul-ture that comes closest to re\ufb02ecting the required change is that of theCIA\u2019s directorate of operations, where the real workers are the spy-masters abroad and those remaining at headquarters are regarded asin a supporting role.\nSecond, and more legitimately, the existing agencies argue that the\ncenters as the primary producers of intelligence would be inclinedtoward focusing on current intelligence and would tend to produceworst-case analyses. Based on the experience of the military\u2019s uni\ufb01ed\n94 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ncommands, those are serious objections \u2013 although at this point, theanalogy between the centers and the military commands begins tobreak down. The uni\ufb01ed commands tend to have short time horizonsand to worry about worst cases, for understandable reasons: if warbroke out today, they would have to \ufb01ght it. In a similar way, thecenters would be the \ufb01rst to be blamed if crises developed withoutwarning, and their plans would be the \ufb01rst to be exposed if remediesfailed. So, the bias toward current intelligence and the dramaticover-warning that now af\ufb02ict all of U.S. intelligence could get worse.\nIn the end, it is a matter of degree and of countervailing pres-\nsures. Already, the bias toward today\u2019s hot issues is pervasive. With achanged structure, a DNI would need to ensure that there were places,such as the existing NIC or the CIA\u2019s Strategic Assessments Group(SAG), that lean against the wind and have at least a little protectionfrom the urgency of the immediate. The fate of the SAG, however,is cautionary. It was disbanded in 2006 in a way that raised questionsabout both substance and process. In substance, apparently, the crit-icism of SAG was that it had not produced enough, where \u201cproduc-\ntion\u201d apparently was equated with production for the PDB \u2013 just theshort-term commentary the SAG presumably was intended notto do.\nIn process, it is not clear that anyone outside the Of\ufb01ce of Transna-tional Issues at the CIA had any voice in the decisions \u2013 not even theCIA\u2019s deputy director of intelligence, let alone the DNI.\nThe WMD Commission recommended creating a second center, a\nNational Counterproliferation Center, and it was indeed created. TheWMD Commission imagined \u2013 and the Bush administration created \u2013the center in a structure very different from the NCTC. In its concep-tion, the center was to be small and focused on overseeing collectionand analysis. Planning and operations would be left to wider intera-gency groupings. There is also a National Counterintelligence Exec-utive (NCIX); it builds on earlier similar organizations and is less a\u201ccenter\u201d in the Senate bill\u2019s sense of the term than a focal point for aspecialized intelligence task: counterintelligence.\nThe WMD Commission also suggested building on the center con-\ncept by appointing \u201cmission managers\u201d for priority topics, and theBush administration adopted that idea as well. Those managers, whowork for the DNI, are meant to drive collection and oversee analy-sis in their areas, and they serve as a clearinghouse for senior policy\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 95\nmakers seeking expertise in that area. It is interesting that this con-ception is akin to the original notion of NIOs in the early 1970s. In\ufb02u-enced by their experience with a special assistant for Vietnam affairs,DCIs James Schlesinger and William Colby fashioned the NIOs aspoints for one-stop shopping in their respective areas.\n25As suggested\nin Chapter 3, the challenge that the mission managers will face is thesame one that NIOs have faced before them: knowing enough aboutcollection sources and technologies to actually have some effect oncollection. By 2008, the DNI had created three such mission managers:for Iran, North Korea, and Cuba\u2013Venezuela.\nMake the DCI Separate from the DNI\nIn the 9/11 Commission\u2019s vision, more or less incorporated in the\ufb01nal bill, the DCI was to be primarily responsible for building a bet-ter espionage capacity for the nation. The DCI at the time, then theCIA director, Porter Goss, appointed in 2004, indeed made that hispriority, almost his exclusive priority. The task includes, in the Com-mission\u2019s words, \u201ctransforming the clandestine service by building itshuman intelligence capabilities; developing a stronger language pro-gram, with high standards and suf\ufb01cient \ufb01nancial incentives; renewingemphasis on recruiting diversity among operations of\ufb01cers so they canblend more easily in foreign cities; ensuring a seamless relationshipbetween human source collection and signals collection at the oper-ational level; and stressing a better balance between unilateral andliaison operations.\u201d The Bush administration also made the DCI thenational manager of human intelligence, with a deputy charged withthe wider responsibility of overseeing human intelligence across theintelligence community.\nNo DCI had wanted to surrender direct management of the CIA,\nfearing that the loss of \u201ctroops\u201d would mean a loss of power. The 9/11Commission recognized that risk but argued that clandestine opera-tions are tactical and require close attention. In any case, if the DNIran the CIA, that of\ufb01cial would be an advocate for CIA funding aswell as the administrator of overall intelligence funding, which is acon\ufb02ict of interest. It also noted that the law charges the CIA withforeign intelligence, while a critical task for the DNI will be to coordi-\nnate intelligence across the foreign\u2013domestic divide.\n96 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nIt is interesting that when the CIA was \ufb01rst created in the 1940s,\nit was intended to be what its name implied \u2013 a central coordinatingof\ufb01ce. It was not expected to produce much analysis of its own, norwas it expected to conduct clandestine intelligence operations abroad.The State Department\u2019s distaste for clandestine operations soon gotthe CIA involved in operations, and the military\u2019s lack of interest orcumbersomeness in developing spy planes and spy satellites got theCIA into the technology business. Soon, it had become not the coordi-nating agency but rather another agency needing coordination, and sothe con\ufb02ict of interest between the DCI\u2019s roles as director of the CIAand overseer of all intelligence emerged. That con\ufb02ict was muted onlybecause the DCI did not have much authority in the overseer role.\nMore important, having the DNI also continue to run the CIA\nwould have created an overwhelming workload, even worse than theone faced by the DCI. As the 9/11 Commission stated: \u201cThe DCI nowhas at least three jobs. He is expected to run a particular agency, theCIA. He is expected to manage the loose confederation of agenciesthat is the intelligence community. He is expected to be the analystin chief for the government, sifting evidence and directly brie\ufb01ng thePresident as his principal intelligence adviser.\u201d\n26T h e9 / 1 1C o m m i s -\nsion hoped a DNI would be able to exercise the third responsibilitywhile actually managing the second. In fact, DCIs mostly wound updoing the \ufb01rst: running the agency they could command. It was theirsand close at hand; moreover, running operations abroad was bothinteresting and politically delicate, so constant tactical managementis required \u2013 just as the 9/11 Commission observed.\nThe DNI still has two jobs, and balancing the two will be no easy\nfeat. A DNI who tilted the balance between managing and advisingtoo far toward the former would risk losing the credibility to manage.Conversely, tilting it too far toward the latter would risk losing thetime to manage \u2013 the preference that dogged Negroponte. To be sure,the relationship between the DNI and the DCI will be complicated.One insider likened the early rounds in the process of working outwhich CIA and intelligence community functions housed at the CIAwould stay there and which would go to the DNI to the \u201cpartition ofIndia.\u201d\nWill both the DNI and the DCI meet the president in the morn-\ning with the PDB? Who would prepare that brief? The new DNI,\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 97\nNegroponte, seemed to win the early rounds, with the president indi-cating that he, not the DCI, would deliver what has been the CIA\u2019s\u201ccrown jewels,\u201d the PDB. Eventually, the relationship between thetwo might evolve to something like that between the attorney gen-eral and the FBI director: in form, boss and subordinate, but for somepurposes more like equals. Negroponte\u2019s successor, Mike McConnell,reportedly tried to divest himself of the role of delivering the PDB,but the president insisted. Hardly anyone in Washington ever turnsdown \u201cface time\u201d with the president, but the cost to the DNI\u2019s otherrole is apparent. As one of his senior deputies told me in 2008, \u201cTheDNI spends his days waiting outside the Oval Of\ufb01ce for the President,trying to manage the community on his Blackberry.\u201d\nAs the DNI attempts to build authority over budgeting and exec-\nutive hiring decisions and to be the president\u2019s principal intelligenceof\ufb01ce, he or she will need the assistance of a dedicated intelligencestaff. The NCTC, along with the other centers, might effectivelyserve as such a staff. So might the NIC, whose role is underscoredby the 2004 bill and subsequent decisions \u2013 for instance, to create aLong-Term Analysis Unit at the NIC and later to make NIOs respon-sible for preparing Of\ufb01ce of the Director of National Intelligence(ODNI) principals for major interagency committee meetings, thoseof the principals and the deputies (PCs and DCs in \u201cgovernmentese\u201d).The NIC, however, is likely to be stretched by the tension between anenhanced role in current intelligence, as overseer in some form of thePDB and preparer of interagency meetings, and its traditional role asproducer of deeper and longer term intelligence, especially the NIEs.\nIn one area, paramilitary operations, the 9/11 Commission would\nhave had the CIA cede responsibility for directing and executing oper-ations to the military. However, the Commission found the Afghan-istan precedent of joint CIA\u2013military teams a good one and suggestedthat CIA capabilities and people should be integrated into military-directed teams, giving both the CIA and the Special OperationsForces the opportunity to do what each does best. The 2004 bill wassilent on this issue, and the CIA and the military decided that bothwould remain in the paramilitary-operations business.\nLike other major recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, this\none also had a long and hoary history. The arguments for giving con-trol to the military historically have been those the commission cited:\n98 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthe requisite capabilities are military, the task has not been a continu-ous priority for the CIA, and it makes no sense for the nation to buildtwo parallel capacities. On the other side of the argument is concernthat the military was never agile or discreet, let alone covert. That con-cern may have diminished but it has not disappeared, as the SpecialOperations Forces have developed a wide variety of units and typesof operations.\nWhatever else is occurring, the Special Operations Forces and the\nCIA are being thrust together, which seemed an effective partnership,especially in Afghanistan, and the 9/11 Commission applauds it. How-ever, it raises thorny questions of authorization and accountability \u2013questions that are not settled by the Commission\u2019s recommendation(and which are discussed in Chapter 8).\nOperations by the military would give those carrying them out the\nstatus of combatants under international law, at least if they were vis-ibly soldiers. CIA covert actions require a presidential \ufb01nding, onetransferred in secret to the relevant committees of Congress. By con-trast, a similar operation conducted by the Special Operations Forcescould be set in motion simply by the chain of command from the presi-dent as commander in chief. The difference may be less than meets theeye, however, if \ufb01ndings have become so broad in the war on terror-ism as to cover almost any CIA operation. If so, however, the problemlies with the breadth of the \ufb01ndings.\n27If they are so broad as to cover\nalmost anything, then the \ufb01nding process has become a sham. Thisissue is explored in more detail in Chapter 8.\nDo Not Create a Separate Domestic Intelligence Agency\nBoth Commissions decided and Congress agreed that the argumentsfor creating a separate domestic-intelligence service in the early yearsafter September 11 were not persuasive and that the FBI should begiven time and encouragement to build its own intelligence capacity.The WMD Commission, however, went further than the 9/11 Com-mission and recommended creating not just a DI within the FBI butalso an NSB, incorporating intelligence plus the FBI\u2019s CTD and theCD. It feared that even an enhanced DI would lack the ability to taskthe FBI \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces for information or control the intelligence budget,\nT h eI m p e r a t i v eo fC h a n g e 99\nmost of which is spent by the CTD and the CD. In the WMD Com-mission\u2019s phrase, \u201cThe Directorate of Intelligence may \u2018task\u2019 the \ufb01eldof\ufb01ces to collect against certain requirements . . . [but] its \u2018taskings\u2019are really \u2018askings.\u2019\u201d\n28It envisioned an FBI national-security service\nwith about the same relationship to the DNI that NSA and NGA willhave.\nAs a critical step in remaking its mission from law enforcement to\nintelligence-driven prevention in the \ufb01ght against terror, the FBI tookthe WMD Commission\u2019s recommendation and created a NSB alongthe lines suggested. Yet, the question of whether law enforcementand intelligence can \u2013 or should \u2013 be combined in the same agencywill remain on the agenda. Is the FBI likely to remain \u2013 and perhapsshould remain \u2013 primarily a case-based law enforcement organiza-tion? It is good at that. Yet, can pursuing individual cases the way theFBI does build a comprehensive intelligence picture, even if the casesare intelligence, not law enforcement? Or, are the two disciplines \u2013law enforcement and intelligence \u2013 such different disciplines that theycannot or should not be combined in the same agency? These issueswill remain on the agenda, especially if there were another major ter-rorist attack on the United States. Chapter 5 discusses these issues inmore detail.\n5\nThe Agenda Ahead\nThe main challenge ahead is also the reason for having a DNI inthe \ufb01rst place \u2013 to better manage the entire set of U.S. intelligenceagencies so that the nation gets the most for the $43-plus billion itspends each year on intelligence. For Negroponte to deliver the PDBwas a bureaucratic victory, but the nation did not need a DNI todeliver the PDB; for that, the prior DCI was \ufb01ne. Negroponte\u2019s rel-atively brief tenure as DNI was distinguished mostly by bureaucracy-building, thereby reinforcing the argument of the skeptics that thecreation of the DNI would only add one more layer of organizational\u201cclutter.\u201d Negroponte conveyed the air of a person who had taken thejob out of duty rather than real interest or commitment. He seemedfrom the start eager to return to his career home, the State Depart-ment, and made the move quickly in 2007 when the position of deputysecretary was offered. Indeed, that he was prepared to trade the postof DNI for the number-two job at State was a commentary on thestatus of the reshaping of intelligence \u2013 and not a good one.\nMuch of the task ahead is implicit in the DNI\u2019s mandate to break\ndown the stovepipes, asking how best the United States might get theinformation it needs. The challenges to existing organizational cultureare daunting. The DNI needs to be a major player in programmaticdecisions, especially about collection systems, which consume most ofintelligence\u2019s budgets. The need becomes more pressing as the distinc-tion between \u201cnational\u201d and \u201ctactical\u201d systems blurs, meaning that theintelligence agencies and the Pentagon share systems and compete forpriority.\n100\nThe Agenda Ahead 101\nThe second challenge will be to drive the intelligence community to\ntry to become a collection of adaptive-learning organizations. Againand again, I participate in variants of the same conversation with col-leagues and observers, ranging from former CIA of\ufb01cers to the Swissdiplomat who tried in vain to make Switzerland\u2019s agencies into a realintelligence community. The conversation begins with the quality ofthe people. I say to CIA audiences \u2013 and mean it \u2013 that person forperson, the CIA is as good an organization as I have known, publicor private, from RAND to the Harvard faculty.\n1When speaking, I\nam usually too polite to say it, but the private conversations almostalways end with the plaintive observation, \u201cToo bad those good peo-ple are trapped in such a dysfunctional organization\u201d \u2013 and the CIAis far from the worst.\nThe drive to create learning organizations runs across agencies and\ntasks, but it has a particular force with respect to intelligence\u2019s mostprecious asset \u2013 its people. The rapid growth of intelligence orga-nizations, coupled with an age structure that puts large fractions ofexisting employees at or near retirement, opens an enormous oppor-tunity for those organizations to reshape themselves. However, it alsoposes grand challenges not just in mentoring the newcomers but alsoin adjusting work practices to attract and retain them.\nThe third challenge is domestic intelligence and how it relates to\nwhat has been thought of as \u201cforeign\u201d intelligence. In the 2000s, thebody politic was inclined to let the FBI continue with its reshaping,from an almost pure law enforcement organization to one giving prideof place to prevention and intelligence. Bureau leaders committed to afundamental change in mission and practice. Terrorism is a matter forboth intelligence and law enforcement, and now the \u201cwall\u201d that usedto separate the two \u2013 including the wall that existed within the FBI \u2013has been all but erased. Of\ufb01cials seeking intelligence can share infor-mation with colleagues who are investigating a criminal case. This didnot seem the right time to tear apart that incipient cooperation by cre-ating a separate intelligence agency outside the FBI. Only time andthe future of an age of terror will tell whether this continues to be theright decision.\nThis chapter outlines the three challenges, those that lie beyond\nthe structural change outlined in Chapter 4: developing centers andmission managers to enable the United States to do its intelligence\n102 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nbusiness around issues or threats, not sources or agencies. Chapter6 addresses the especially important task of improving intelligenceanalysis.\nthe dimensions of the challenge: the future\nimagery architecture \ufb01asco\nThe 2004 legislation creating the DNI was a beginning. The \ufb01rst twooccupants of the job, John Negroponte and Mike McConnell, came tothe task from different histories: the \ufb01rst, someone not from intelli-gence but versed in it and, perhaps more important, who knew how tomake the government work; the second, a former director of the NSAand consummate intelligence insider. The challenge for them was andwill be for their successors to use the license of the law to hunt for realauthority.\nA few years into having a DNI, there was not much evidence of an\nimpact on major programs. McConnell sought to pick up the pace ofreform with a 500-day plan.\n2Emphasizing jointness, it mostly aimed\nto harvest low-hanging fruit. The internal wrangling in 2007\u20132008 overrewriting Executive Order 12333, the basic document covering intelli-gence, was vivid evidence of just how elusive that real authority forDNIs continued to be.\n3The revisions mostly re\ufb02ected the changes\nmade in the 2004 law, especially the creation of the DNI, and updatedthe order to include NRO and NGA. It increased the authority of theDNI in only two areas and only modestly: giving the DNI new author-ity over any intelligence information collected that pertains to morethan one agency \u2013 an attempt to force greater information exchange \u2013and to make acquisition decisions on certain NIPs.\nThe collapse of the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) \u2013 at a loss\nperhaps exceeding $4 billion \u2013 is indicative of the challenges.\n4It also\nunderscores that DNIs will require a much greater analytic capacitythan what they inherited if they are to be compelling inside the execu-tive branch as well as with Congress. It was one of several satellite pro-grams to break down in recent years, leaving the United States withoutdated imaging technology. It was especially revealing of the chal-lenge facing DNIs in managing complex contracts when those con-tracting are multiplying. The idea was a good one, another stage in thesuccessful transition of the so-called national technical systems from\nThe Agenda Ahead 103\npuzzle-solving about the Soviet Union to tactical support to militarycommanders \u2013 the transition that is discussed earlier in this book.\nThe transition meant that by the end of the twentieth century,\nfamiliar targets such as Soviet air bases and missile factories werebeing supplanted by the more varied and elusive threats of the post\u2013Cold War world. At the same time, the armed services, eager forincreased tactical intelligence after the 1991 Persian Gulf War, weredemanding satellites that could instantly stream battle\ufb01eld data towar\ufb01ghters around the globe.\nIn 1996, a DCI commission, chaired by Robert J. Hermann, who\nran the NRO from 1979 to 1981, recommended building a \ufb02eet oflight, small, relatively inexpensive satellites. Together, they could beat least as effective as the Lockheed-built behemoths then in orbit \u2013at a cost of about $1 billion each and about the size and weight of aGreyhound bus, my RAND colleagues had dubbed them \u201cBattlestarGallactica.\u201d\n5Smaller and more numerous satellites would increase\n\u201crevisit times\u201d \u2013 that is, the number of times a day that satellitespass above target sites \u2013 thus keeping better track of moving targetsand making deception through camou\ufb02age more dif\ufb01cult to sustain.Lighter satellites would require less expensive and less powerful rock-ets than the Titan IVs then in use, which could cost up to $450 mil-lion per launching. The commission also envisioned saving money andtime by taking advantage of technologies developed by commercialsatellite companies.\nIt did not turn out that way. Boeing, which had not built such satel-\nlites before, won the bidding with an innovative (and cost-conscious)proposal. However, given the overlapping of military and civilian pur-poses, the requirements multiplied as intelligence and military ser-vices competed to in\ufb02uence the satellite design. Boeing\u2019s initial designfor the optical system that was the heart of one of the two new satel-lite systems was so elaborate that optical engineers working on theproject claimed it could not be built. Engineers constructing a radar-imaging unit that was central to the other satellite could not initiallyproduce the unusually strong radar signal that was needed. In thatsense, the FIA was \ufb02awed from the start. In Hermann\u2019s words, \u201cTheFIA contract was technically \ufb02awed and unexecutable the day it wassigned. Some top of\ufb01cial should have thrown his badge on the tableand screamed, \u2018We can\u2019t do this system at this price.\u2019 No one did.\u201d\n104 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTo be fair, the riskiness of the initial conception was compounded\nby factors that the intelligence community could not control. As partof the Clinton administration\u2019s effort to downsize government, con-trol of big military projects was transferred to contractors on thetheory that they could best manage engineering work and controlcosts. Meanwhile, America\u2019s best engineers were being attracted toGoogle and Apple, not government contracts; therefore, intelligencewas losing expertise in systems engineering \u2013 the science and art ofmanaging complex engineering projects to weigh risks, gauge fea-sibility, test components, and ensure that the pieces come togethersmoothly. Finally, given concern about NRO\u2019s free spending in thepast, Congress demanded rigid spending guidelines for the satelliteproject. The FIA thus became a trifecta of risk: a high-concept tech-nology on a fast schedule with a tightly managed budget.\nThe government continued to hear reassuring words from Boeing\nwhile more than one internal review panel was expressing concernsabout the feasibility of the project, given its budget cap of $5 billion(and $1 billion per year). As Albert D. (\u201cBud\u201d) Wheelon, who foun-ded the Directorate of Science and Technology at the CIA in 1963 andplayed a leading role in the early development of spy satellites, said,\u201cWriting winning proposals is different from building winning hard-ware.\u201d By the time the FIA was killed in September 2005 \u2013 a year afterthe \ufb01rst satellite was originally to have been delivered \u2013 cost estimatesran as high as $18 billion. Although the FIA was ambitious and inno-vative, it was so within a stovepipe where the NRO had been a techno-logical leader \u2013 building reconnaissance satellites.\nbreaking down the stovepipes\nYet, the strategic management task requires not just driving trade-offs within the stovepipes but across them as well. At present, U.S.collection produces too much data and too little information, and col-lection techniques, especially for imagery, are fairly well understoodby targets. New technical collection systems, especially for imagery,threaten to overwhelm processing; however, according to the WMDCommission, in the case of Iraq, both IMINT and SIGINT \u201cproducedprecious little intelligence for the analysts to analyze.\u201d\n6Moreover, the\nof\ufb01cial cover-based Cold War espionage practices that occasionally\nThe Agenda Ahead 105\nworked against Soviet-bloc diplomats will not work on Al Qaedaoperatives. The challenge is to be less passive and quicker in inno-vation. For signals, that means getting closer to targets; for imagery,it means smaller platforms, more use of stealth, and employing moreof the spectrum. For espionage, it means more diversity in spymastersand moving out of of\ufb01cial cover. However, it also means being patient.\n\u201cThe intelligence failure in Iraq did not begin with faulty analysis.\nIt began with a sweeping collection failure\u201d \u2013 so said the WMD Com-mission. Every blue-ribbon panel called for improving America\u2019s espi-onage, or HUMINT. The call is worthy, but expectations have to bereasonable. Beyond HUMINT, much of the U.S. collection architec-ture, like satellites for imagery and eavesdropping, is fairly well under-stood by would-be adversaries. Those adversaries routinely camou-\ufb02age sensitive activities when they know satellites are overhead. Thus,the long-term challenges for U.S. intelligence are to move away frompassive surveillance techniques toward more directed collection andto shorten the cycle of innovation in order to be less predictable forwould-be targets.\nOn the espionage side \u2013 however one judges the past half-century\nof U.S. espionage \u2013 doing better against tomorrow\u2019s more dif\ufb01cult tar-gets, such as terrorists, will not be easy. The required actions \u2013 suchas making more use of America\u2019s ethnic diversity or moving spyingout of of\ufb01cial cover \u2013 take time and money. For instance, the experi-ence with spymasters under nonof\ufb01cial cover, called NOCs, so far hasbeen mixed at best. Other countries have done better \u2013 for example,the Soviet Union during the Cold War and China now \u2013 so patienceis required. NOCs are expensive in money and time to deploy andsustain and, because they have to actually live their cover, their timefor recruiting spies is limited. Thus, they are costly for the informa-tion they provide. Lacking the diplomatic immunity of of\ufb01cial cover,recruiting spies under nonof\ufb01cial cover also can be dangerous.\nThe dif\ufb01culty of the task is not an argument against trying to do\nbetter.\n7It is, however, an argument against expecting too much. Suc-\ncessful espionage requires both patience and a willingness to traf\ufb01cwith unsavory characters. Neither comes easily to the American sys-tem. The dilemma runs still deeper: in many respects, effective spyingrequires attributes that are precisely the opposite of accountability inAmerica\u2019s governance. Spying requires giving considerable discretion\n106 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nto case of\ufb01cers in the \ufb01eld. Government, by contrast, tends to theopposite: narrowing discretion downward while it pushes accountabil-ity upward.\n8\nThis means that while the United States can do better at espionage,\nin the end, it will still be dependent on friends \u2013 and even nonfriends \u2013who have access where we do not and perhaps may employ methodsthat we would not. This means not only tending the rather \u201cclubby\u201dliaison relationships of the Cold War \u2013 most of them with fellowEnglish-speaking nations \u2013 but also engaging in speci\ufb01c and limitedsharing and trading with nations such as Syria or Somalia, where theoverlap of common interest is present but limited.\nBeyond espionage, intelligence faces the paradox of too much data\nbut too little information. During the Cold War, information on theSoviet Union was in too short supply. Now, however, two things havechanged. First, although terrorists are secretive, they (like the rest ofus) leave a trail through their travels, purchases, licenses, and so forth.Their cell phones and providers know where they are \u2013 until they pur-chase a new card. Thus, data that are not secret (e.g., telephone num-bers and driver\u2019s licenses) are also relevant, which imposes on intel-ligence the need to develop ways to search huge amounts of data \u2013 aneed more dif\ufb01cult for an intelligence community that for reasons ofsecrecy and culture has not been at the forefront of the IT revolution.\nSecond, intelligence\u2019s own technical capabilities to produce secret\ninformation, such as imagery from spy satellites, have mushroomed.Each new round of collection systems dramatically increases the take,especially in imagery; however, the capacity to process and analyzethat take falls farther and farther behind.\n9As one example among\nmany, even before September 11, the NSA could collect the equiva-lent of the holdings of the Library of Congress in three hours.\n10As a\nresult, the big collectors of signals and imagery intelligence \u2013 the NSAand the NGA \u2013 will be tempted to solve their processing problem byturning the \ufb01re hose of data on intelligence\u2019s analysts. After all, thatis the way to ensure that the collectors are not the culprits for the nextintelligence failure; they passed the data, even if the critical items werelost in torrents. A better balance is needed between investments in theemerging new-generation collection systems and enhanced forms ofanalytical capability. The latter means a greatly expanded investmentin quality personnel and new technologies that assist analysts instead\nThe Agenda Ahead 107\nof overwhelming them. Simply stated, terabytes of data collected butunprocessed and unanalyzed are useless to policy makers.\nAt the same time, all that collection risks producing less informa-\ntion even as it produces more data. The changed nature of the targetis part of the reason, just as that change is the major challenge foranalysis.\n11As Chapter 2 indicates, the objects of scrutiny broadened.\nDuring the Cold War, those objects were big and central; now, theyalso include the small and peripheral. Then, the focus was the RedArmy on the central front in Europe; now, given the harm that smallgroups or individuals can wreak, they are the objects of scrutiny \u2013 andthey may be located in places like Afghanistan that are not of muchinterest for any other reason.\nSpy satellites are good at seeing large armored formations but can-\nnot \u201csee\u201d terrorist networks; easily follow small, fast-moving groups;or help us know what is occurring inside chemical plants. Moreover,U.S. adversaries know much about U.S. techniques, often includingthe orbits of satellites, and therefore they conceal their activities.Some state adversaries, such as North Korea, have invested enor-mously in underground facilities to protect \u2013 as well as to hide \u2013 theirWMD or related activities.\nSIGINT faces even sharper challenges from digitizing, packet-\nswitching, \ufb01ber optics, and encryption.\n12Digitizing makes it possible\nto send huge amounts of information over a single channel, therebyvastly compounding the challenge of sorting out particular communi-cations of interest. Packet-switching means that the routing of a mes-sage may be changed in the middle of a communication and that theaddressee of a message can be sent in a different packet from the mes-sage itself. With the improvement in cable transmission made possiblethrough \ufb01ber optics, fewer messages are sent into the open air, wheresatellites or ground stations can intercept them. The United Statesmust get physically close to the communications channels it seeks tointercept.\nOn the technical side, U.S. collection must be more targeted and\nmore innovative. The Iraq case suggests that IMINT and SIGINTwere driven by the capabilities that existed, not by what was needed.Intelligence was much better at locating large formations than atobtaining the locations of important individuals, much less in\ufb01ltrat-ing their conversations.\n13The demands of \u201cforce protection\u201d \u2013 in this\n108 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ncase, detecting signs of threats to U.S. and allied pilots \ufb02ying patrolsin the northern and southern \u201cno \ufb02y\u201d zones \u2013 limited the resourcesthat could be devoted to understanding the WMD problem. Beforethe creation of the DNI, the Intelligence Community ManagementStaff had begun to sharpen targeting through its Collection ConceptsDevelopment Center. That center drew in knowledgeable outsidersto take a fresh look at collection with respect to a particular targetor mission. Those reviews necessarily were driven by questions, notsources, and therefore began to bind collection and analysis togetheraround issues.\nIntelligence\u2019s impressive technical achievements during the Cold\nWar are now \u201clong in the tooth,\u201d and the primacy of satellites remains.The United States needs to broaden its collection means and shortenthe cycle of innovation. As in Silicon Valley, innovations may remainsecret but not for long; therefore, intelligence will have to adapt fasterthan its targets if it is to stay ahead. For signals, adapting means \ufb01nd-ing new ways to get closer to targets; for imagery, it means more use ofsmaller satellites, or drones, or stealth technology. It also means usingnew parts of the spectrum, such as hyperspectral imagery, to iden-tify ef\ufb02uents from buildings or factories, as well as a range of tech-nologies in what is called measurement and signatures intelligence(MASINT).\nPushing innovation and making better choices across the collection\nstovepipes is the chief rationale for having a DNI in the \ufb01rst place. Itis the collectors that consume three quarters of the $40 billion intel-ligence budget. If the DNI does not have the power to collapse thestovepipes, he or she can develop more analytic capacity to maketrade-offs across them: \u201cHow do ground stations compare with satel-lites for particular SIGINT missions? Can HUMINT do a mission lessexpensively?\u201d Many intelligence successes are the result of cooper-ation across the INTs: HUMINT or open sources may provide tips,which then lead to places to be imaged and communications lines tobe monitored. However, to take advantage of such cooperation, ana-lysts and collection managers need to know what the various INTs aredoing and can do.\nThe WMD Commission suggested that the DNI create an \u201cinte-\ngrated collection enterprise\u201d for the intelligence community toprovide for coordination across the entire cycle from planning new\nThe Agenda Ahead 109\nsystems, to developing strategies for deploying existing systems aga-inst priority targets, to processing and exploiting information that isproduced. The DNI\u2019s centers for counterterrorism and counterpro-liferation, as well as the issue managers for North Korea, Iran, andCuba\u2013Venezuela, are steps in the right direction, although so far rel-atively modest steps. So is the still more recent creation of the DNI\u2019sNational Intelligence Coordination Center (NIC-C), which is verymuch a work in progress. The DNI\u2019s Integrated Concepts Develop-ment Of\ufb01ce (ICDO), a descendant of the Collection Concepts Devel-opment Center, has a similar charge to push innovation with regard toparticular intelligence challenges, especially in collection.\nIn any event, much of the initiative still rests with the Pentagon,\nand DNIs have been and will continue to be hard-pressed to movefast to create troops, build authority, and work out arrangements withthe secretary and undersecretary of defense. The law provided for thetransfer of the NIC to the DNI, along with the NIC\u2019s counterpart forthe business of the intelligence community, the Community Manage-ment Staff (CMS). As it existed in 2004, however, the CMS was inca-pable of helping DNIs actually manage the community; recognizingthat situation, the law provided for 500 new of\ufb01cial positions for theDNI, plus 150 to be seconded from other agencies. Previously, theCMS\u2019s budget function was largely con\ufb01ned to arguing for programsand to a \u201cbean-counting\u201d review; in con\ufb02icts with the Pentagon, italmost always lost. Building analytic clout to fashion an intelligenceprogram and budget that will be compelling to both internal admin-istration decision makers and Congress has taken considerable time.Meanwhile, the DNIs have risked not being major players on preciselythe intelligence decisions that were the reason for creating the posi-tion of the DNI in the \ufb01rst place.\nlearning from learning organizations\nIn the process, the organizations that comprise the intelligence com-munity need to become more adaptive, learning organizations. Whatcan be learned from other organizations that seek to embody highperformance and learning?\n14The concepts of a learning organization\nand organizational learning both arose from organizational theory inthe 1970s. Everyday use and the media do not generally differentiate\n110 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nbetween them and, for convenience, neither does this chapter. Theconcept of a learning organization is more applied and practical,found in the management consulting industry and promoted by pop-ular writers such as Peter Senge.\n15Its propositions rest on little sci-\nenti\ufb01c foundation; therefore, it borrows intellectual capital and con-cepts from organizational learning, which is an amalgam of principlesfrom organizational development theory, learning theory, complex-ity and complex adaptive theories, and, more recently, social-networktheory.\nFor immediate purposes, learning organizations practice organiza-\ntional learning: establish infrastructure, roles, and procedures to cap-ture and exploit knowledge of internal processes and of the causesand consequences of success and failure at the organizational andindividual levels. Learning based on cumulative, analyzed knowledgeenables the continuity and continuous improvement of internal pro-cesses, change in organizational and individual behavior, adaptationto changing environments, and competitive advantage.\nThe work on knowledge diffusion and management naturally con-\nverges with that of organizational learning. The theoretical and exper-imental work in the area has grown considerably in the past twentyyears, but critics note with more than a little irony that the body ofresearch is not coherent and fails to coalesce into a cumulative bodyof knowledge. For the critics, some articles on both learning organi-zations and organizational learning tend to produce conceptual com-plexity without clarity and to reify jargon, resulting in what one papercalled the \u201cmysti\ufb01cation of the \ufb01eld\u201d \u2013 certainly something never seenin intelligence!\n16\nNonetheless, the intellectual ancestry of organizational learning\nincludes such respected scholars as Edgar Schein, Chris Argyris, andKurt Lewin, among other pillars of organizational psychology. Someof the concepts are provocative, providing intuitive value as modelsof organizational development and effectiveness. Organizations highin learning competence are said to cultivate a culture, internal lan-guage, and systems for understanding how internal and external envi-ronments interact to affect the organization\u2019s mission and success andwhen they signal a need for internal change. They have a structureand process, including feedback loops that cross both individual andorganizational levels, for assessing failure and success and managing\nThe Agenda Ahead 111\nand propagating knowledge that affects them. Proponents of organi-zational learning construe these systems as strategic assets that confercompetitive advantage on corporations or other groups.\nThere also is consensus among practitioners and students about the\nrequisites of high-performance organizations, in the public as well asthe private sector.\n17High-performance organizations evince the fol-\nlowing:\nra clear, well-articulated mission\nra strategic approach to partnerships\nrfocus on needs of clients and customers\nrstrategic management of peopleMission. Because most public-sector organizations lack the conve-\nnient bottom line of pro\ufb01t and loss \u2013 that is, a clear if limited index ofprogress or lack of it relative to goals \u2013 clarity in mission is critical.\n18\nThe Volcker Commission, formally the National Commission on thePublic Service, emphasized the need for missions that are clear andunambiguous.\n19Government Executive\u2019 s examination of \ufb01ve years of\nreviews of agencies\u2019 performance did so as well.20High-performing\nagencies begin with missions that are clear and clearly supported bytheir authorizing bodies, especially Congress. For instance, the SocialSecurity Administration (SSA) mission is straightforward \u2013 to getchecks and information to people who need them.\nBy contrast, the old INS and the Forest Service ranked poorly in\npart because of split missions \u2013 for the INS, to keep illegal immigrantsout of the United States and to help legal immigrants become citizens\nand receive federal bene\ufb01ts; for the Forest Service, to preserve publiclands and produce resources from them. The Forest Service also\nsuffered from changing minds in Congress about where to strike thatbalance. Changes have been even more of a problem for the InternalRevenue Service (IRS), which would seem to have as a mission theclear mirror image of the SSA: collect taxes from those who owe them.Yet, in different political seasons, the IRS is alternately criticized forletting tax cheats get away and for harassing innocent citizens.\nPerhaps the single greatest \u201cgrowing pain\u201d of DHS \u2013 which brought\ntogether 180,000 employees from twenty-two existing agencies \u2013 wasthat the constituent agencies did not and still do not share a single\n112 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nmission \u2013 far from it. By one rule of thumb, the constituent agenciesin a merger like DHS ought to overlap in mission by at least half.\nWhen the Cold War ended, intelligence looked for new consumers\nand, at \ufb01rst, found them in domestic agencies such as the Depart-ment of Commerce, which wanted staff work as much as intelli-gence analysis. Then, after the attacks of September 11, its consumersmushroomed \u2013 this time including state and local of\ufb01cials and pri-vate managers of infrastructure. As a service industry, intelligencefound it dif\ufb01cult to turn away customers. As a result, for instance,intelligence\u2019s analytic mission has become ever more dominated byquestion-answering, not deeper analysis. As more than one inter-viewee stated for a RAND study: \u201cWe used to do analysis, but wenow do reporting.\u201d\n21Plainly, analysis needs to include both reporting\nand analysis, but deciding where to strike the balance \u2013 both withinand across agencies \u2013 is not easily done.\nThe question of mission applies with speci\ufb01c force to the FBI,\nbut the CIA\u2019s future also raises it. Reshaping the FBI\u2019s mission tointelligence-driven prevention still leaves it combining law enforce-ment and intelligence; it will only shift the priority between the two.Does continuing to try to do both mean risking the confusion of mis-sions that has plagued the Forest Service or the former INS, and haskept them from focusing on becoming high-performance organiza-tions? How to do domestic intelligence in an age of terror, and theimplications of choices for the FBI, will remain on the agenda.\nThe future of the CIA, and especially its Directorate of Intelli-\ngence, is an intriguing teaser in this regard because the DNI hasabsorbed what were core DI functions. Long ago, the NIC and theNIE process passed from being a CIA operation to being a DCI oper-ation, but the upgrading of the NIC with the creation of the DNIhas rendered the change more important. After 2004, responsibilityfor the PDB also passed to the DNI through the NIC, although theDI continued to provide the majority of PDB material. In those cir-cumstances, what is and should be the mission of the DI? For whomshould it work? Should its analysis become primarily targeting anal-ysis, with its primary customer being its CIA counterpart, the direc-torate of operations? Or, should (some of) it move in the other direc-tion, accepting the loss of its current intelligence \u201ccrown jewels\u201d anddoing more in-depth studies that were its hallmark two decades agowhen Robert Gates was its head?\nThe Agenda Ahead 113\nPartnerships\nGovernment agencies, intelligence included, are increasingly moredependent on partners \u2013 both domestic and foreign \u2013 in carrying outtheir missions, which came through loud and clear in a RAND sur-vey of both public and private organizations. Both sectors reportedthe need to build more partnerships; however, public organizationsafter September 11 found themselves compelled to seek partners inall directions.\n22That is manifestly true of intelligence, which is now\ndealing not only with new police and intelligence services abroad butalso with the eighteen thousand law enforcement units at home \u2013not to mention private citizens. Dealing with domestic law enforce-ment has raised the dif\ufb01cult problem of sharing information withnew partners \u2013 all the more dif\ufb01cult for intelligence because virtu-ally none of those new partners have security clearances. The newpartnerships also invoke questions of how accountability is to beshared \u2013 questions that have been visible in debates over who warnsAmericans about terrorist threats, when, and on what basis of infor-mation.\nCustomer Needs\nThis is hardly a new challenge for intelligence, which has always beenin the service business, but it is more dif\ufb01cult now because there areso many new customers with new needs \u2013 an issue discussed in moredetail in Chapter 7. Cold War intelligence served mostly political andmilitary leaders of the U.S. federal government, which was enough ofa challenge because intelligence was, for consumers, essentially a freegood; thus, there were no easy metrics for judging value. A series ofefforts \u2013 of which the most recent is the National Intelligence Priori-ties Framework (NIPF) \u2013 sought to interrogate customers about theirpriorities and then assemble the results in a framework that wouldprovide guidance to intelligence collectors and analysts alike.\n23The\nnew challenge is \ufb01nding out what, for instance, state and local part-ners need by way of information and analysis, and then \ufb01nding waysto get it to them.\nFor some agencies, such as the Department of State\u2019s INR, cus-\ntomers are clear and present. However, for other agencies such asthe CIA, working for everyone or the president could mean working\n114 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nfor no one in particular, and CIA leaders have sought carefully toestablish connections in the policy world. The creation of the DNI hasfurther confused who does what and for whom. For instance, threedifferent agencies seemed to have responsibility for intelligence con-nections with state and local of\ufb01cials after the 2004 Act: the DHS,which had the congressional mandate; the FBI, which had the troopsin the \ufb01eld through its \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces and JTTFs; and the ODNI, whichhad the stake.\ndealing with the people of intelligence\nWhat is true for high-performing organizations is manifestly true ofintelligence, as it is for service organizations in general: people areits premier asset. All the agencies must thoughtfully review and pos-sibly redo how they deal with the lives and careers of those assets.For instance, intelligence has been second only to military serviceas a lifetime career; lateral entry has been rare, particularly giventhe demands of security clearance, and a large fraction of those whojoined have stayed for an entire career. This may well be less true inthe future. Many young professionals seek continual challenges. Theywill want to come in and then move on, perhaps returning later, pur-suing what might be called \u201cportfolio careers,\u201d which combine expe-riences in different sectors.\n24\nAll the intelligence agencies have grown like Topsy since Septem-\nber 11, 2001. For the CIA, the exact numbers are classi\ufb01ed, but thedirectorates of analysis and operations both set the goal of doublingtheir size. Between FY2001 and FY2006, the FBI budget grew bythree quarters, and the national-security portion from under a thirdto almost a half. The number of agents working counterterrorismand counterintelligence rose from 2,514 in FY2001 to 4,634 at theend of FY2006. Meanwhile, the Bureau more than doubled the num-ber of intelligence analysts, from 1,023 to 2,161. At the other \u201cthree-letter\u201d agencies, like NSA or NGA, the situation is similar: if growthhas been constrained, it is because of a shortage of quali\ufb01ed appli-cants. Meanwhile, entry-level training programs for intelligence ana-lysts have sprung up at universities around the country.\nThe growth is a wonderful opportunity but, as usual with oppor-\ntunities, also a challenge. The young recruits grew up on Google and\nThe Agenda Ahead 115\nare used to reaching out, not sitting back and waiting for informa-tion to come to them. They are used to being connected in a hundreddirections, not limited by \u201cneed to know.\u201d To overstate for effect,this new generation is fast, not slow; does parallel processing, notserial processing; gives pride of place to graphics, not text; does ran-dom accessing, not step-by-step processing; is connected, not stand-alone; is active, not passive; mixes work and play; is impatient forresults; combines fantasy and reality; and de\ufb01nitely sees technologyas a friend, not a foe. These ten characteristics can either be a greatfuture asset for intelligence or a considerable liability, depending onhow the resources are channeled to solve key intelligence challenges.\nThe intelligence community will not attract or will soon lose these\nyoung people if it does not accommodate to their way of think-ing and learning. Now, however, the intelligence community suffersbecause tools and technologies are rarely, if ever, available in an open-architecture system within the agencies, due to both legacy architec-ture and the constraints of security. As a result, for instance, younganalysts do not have access to these commonly available tools, whichmeans that they will have less capability internally (for their job) whilehaving less familiarity with the innovative ways that others (in theirtarget community) are experimenting and innovating with the sametools. They \ufb01nd, in short, that their workstations at their job are ageneration behind their electronic gadgetry at home.\nThe new entrants are also untrained and, given the aging of the\nintelligence agencies, they will lack for mentors. This problem couldbe turned to an advantage if intelligence emulated the best Wall Street\ufb01rms, which build \u201cgray-green\u201d teams, combining the savvy of veter-ans with the fearlessness of new recruits. If the future of much intelli-gence work is more off-site with less direct contact, of\ufb01cers with moresensitive social skills and acuity to compensate for the decrease insocial cues and contact among distributed teams will be required. Theresearch on dispersed (i.e., virtual) teams reveals decrements in per-formance. Virtual teams also raise questions of security \u2013 information-security policies and technology as well as counterintelligence-riskmonitoring.\nAll agencies will have to dramatically rethink how they deal\nwith the life and career of their people. The new cohorts can openand enrich intelligence in precisely the ways it needs \u2013 but only if\n116 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nintelligence makes major changes in how it recruits, trains, and clearsits people. Managing the people of intelligence has been stovepipedby agencies. Thus, there is virtually no common training across agen-cies and little understanding by of\ufb01cials in one agency of what theircounterparts elsewhere do or how they do it.\n25\nThe creation of the DNI and the DDNI for analysis, along with\na DNI-wide human-capital of\ufb01cer and the DNI\u2019s \ufb01ve-year strategichuman-capital plan, offers the opportunity to think much more strate-gically across the agencies.\n26For instance, to begin to build more\njoint learning in analysis, the DDNI began in 2006 a course knownas \u201cAnalysis 101\u201d for new analysts across the sixteen agencies of theintelligence community. Yet, even this initiative encountered resis-tance from the various agencies on the grounds that it underminedtheir separate \u201cbranding\u201d and, slightly bizarrely, that it might lead to\u201cgroupthink.\u201d\n27\nIf there has been virtually no strategic management of human\nresources across stovepipes, there also has not been much withinthem.\n28For example, intelligence organizations, like the government\nin general, offer relatively generous mid-career training opportuni-ties for analysts as well as others. However, those opportunities areusually ad hoc, not systematic; initiated by individual of\ufb01cers, notplanned strategically across the agency or integrated into a develop-mental program of professional growth; and the numbers of partici-pants are small by comparison to, for example, the analytic cadres.\n29\nPsychologists are also clear in that what gets measured and\nrewarded gets repeated.30For instance, the CIA reward structure ele-\nvated and still elevates items in the PDB; analysts report it is a careergoal and may spend a week writing a single item and negotiating itthrough the daisy chain of clearance. In thinking about reward sys-tems, as for other issues, the variety in the intelligence communityis an ongoing experiment, and its leaders should mine that experi-ment. What, for instance, are the real reward systems for analysts atthe CIA versus INR versus the NSA? What are the effects of thosedifferences? The inquiry is more timely as the intelligence communityaspires to become more joint and as managers acquire more \ufb02exibility\nin rewarding performance.\nAs an example from the front end of the personnel cycle, when\nthe NSA and the NGA sought to reshape their missions from\nThe Agenda Ahead 117\n\u201cgathering\u201d to \u201chunting and gathering,\u201d they encountered questionsabout metrics for judging performance as well as skills needed to per-form.\n31Traditionally, the two agencies\u2019 initial processing and analysis\nwere driven by what they collected; the process was gathering \u2013 whatmight be called \u201cef\ufb01cient production.\u201d An NSA veteran remembershaving delivered each morning the take from \u201cher frequencies\u201d \u2013 sev-eral Soviet communications channels that the NSA was monitoring \u2013and her job was to process that take. Gathering will continue \u2013 in pop-ulating databases, for example \u2013 and it will remain a type of industrialprocess, albeit often a sophisticated one.\nHowever, the \u201chunters\u201d may need to be different than the \u201cgath-\nerers\u201d in background, temperament, and training. The hunters willreach out for data, looking across datasets and INTs. They will beengaged in what might be called \u201cinnovation operations,\u201d and theyprobably will need, \ufb01rst, to be judged by different metrics than theproducers and, ultimately, may be different people than those theagencies traditionally have sought.\nThe 2004 bill said the right things about training, emphasizing train-\ning across disciplines and training that would facilitate rotations ofintelligence of\ufb01cers across agencies. The WMD Commission recom-mended a National Intelligence University to promote jointness intraining. However, the bill spoke of language training \ufb01rst and thendevoted most of the discussion of training to creating an IntelligenceCommunity Scholarship Program to provide stipends to universitystudents in exchange for commitment to later service in intelligence.The National Intelligence University has been established, but it hasbeen slow in beginning to make a difference; the agencies pushedback, even in language training, if it seemed that the DNI was prepar-ing to evaluate their performance.\nIn interviews across the analytic agencies, none had much famil-\niarity with the analytic techniques of the others. In all, there tendedto be signi\ufb01cant emphasis on \u201cskill-level\u201d certi\ufb01cation, organizationalprocesses, and writing and communication skills with less emphasison analytic methods. There is a striking absence of community-widecommon course components of emphasis on community-wide per-spectives.\n32\nThat driver is one among several that leads to an emphasis on cre-\ndentials in training, perhaps at the expense of techniques more directly\n118 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nrelated to immediate analytic work. The CIA University, for instance,confers bachelors and masters degrees, which the Joint Military Intel-ligence College (JMIC) offers well. Of course, there is nothing wrongwith degrees and other credentials. However, operators express con-cern that the schools are too distant from the needs of operators tobe as helpful as they might be. From the perspective of the trainers,the concern was keeping up with the pace of needs \u2013 usually de\ufb01nedas knowledge about a speci\ufb01c new area or country \u2013 in circumstancesin which the most knowledgeable possible \u201cteachers\u201d were preciselythose experts in highest immediate demand. The CIA\u2019s Sherman KentSchool for Intelligence Analysis (part of the CIA University), forinstance, offers eighty courses on specialty disciplines.\nInitiatives in tradecraft are also isolated. The Kent School, for\ninstance, tries to keep up with best practice in the private sectorsby sustaining four small teams: one team handles outreach; anotherfocuses on product evaluation; a third looks at methods, includingtools; and a fourth team treats integration, which means trying to keepthe School\u2019s offerings matched to the needs of the CIA\u2019s DI. With therush of immediate need, there are few opportunities or mechanismsfor jointly looking at tradecraft, for understanding how other agenciesdo \u201canalysis\u201d and what might be learned from them, or for develop-ing centers of training excellence that develop comparative advantageinstead of duplicating what has been done elsewhere.\nRegular joint training experiments and \ufb01eld tests in tradecraft \u2013 in\nboth analysis and operations \u2013 would make sense, \ufb01rst, because thereis a basis in methods that is shared across different tasks of intelligenceanalysis. Now \u2013 while there is debate about how deeply the U.S. mili-tary should engage in espionage \u2013 would-be military spymasters trainat CIA schools. Second, that training could begin to foster more senseof joint tradecraft, more community awareness on the part of intelli-gence of\ufb01cers of what their counterparts in other agencies do or coulddo. The process could contribute to advancing joint efforts more gen-erally across the intelligence community.\nIn the early 1990s I had the opportunity to create the Intelligence\nFellows Program. The idea was to give several score of the intelli-gence community\u2019s future leaders, those who had just been selectedfor Senior Intelligence Service (SIS) \u2013 the equivalent of Senior Exec-utive Service in the rest of the government \u2013 an opportunity for two\nThe Agenda Ahead 119\nweeks away from the job to come to know each other and their work,re\ufb02ect on their own work, and confront cases and other materials thatwould broaden their perspective as they began to not only manage butalso lead their agencies. Fortunately, the program has continued andthere is a counterpart more focused on management. The NationalIntelligence University needs more such \ufb02agship programs.\nThe vision for intelligence training should emulate the military \u2013\njoint and integral to careers. In interviews, of\ufb01cials engaged in analysisendorsed the idea of some initial joint training of analysts \u2013 like Anal-ysis 101 \u2013 but also said another joint training experience at perhaps\ufb01ve years into a career would be at least as valuable because by then,of\ufb01cials in one agency are more likely to actually need to work withother agencies. At present, intelligence is far from that vision: trainingis discretionary and individual, not required and strategic. Training isfar from the expectation on the way up; indeed, too often the bestintelligence of\ufb01cers are deterred from training by the imperative tonot \u201cleave the \ufb02agpole.\u201d Intelligence agencies do not have the slackin their of\ufb01cer ranks that would permit of\ufb01cers to routinely depart forseveral months or even a year.\nRecent legislation has freed the DHS and Department of Defense\nfrom many civil-service constraints. Now, more than half of the civil-ian federal government employees do not work under traditional civil-service rules. While intelligence agencies are not generally bound bythose rules, in practice, they have until recently followed them. How-ever, managers across the agencies have more latitude in managingand rewarding performance.\n33\nTo be sure, in shepherding that most precious of assets, people, the\nopportunity is a double-edged sword. The experiment is on, but thestakes are high and the jury is out. The intelligence community hasjust as much opportunity to succeed as to drive down performance anddrive up attrition, absenteeism, security violations, and other symp-toms of a bad personnel-management system. So far, the experiencehas been that discretion to reward performance often goes unused;superiors hold back from taking the responsibility that goes with usingthe discretion they have, more frequently if performance metrics areill de\ufb01ned. The last position intelligence should take is to fall backto the easier metrics, such as numbers of agent recruitments for CIAoperators or PDB items for analysts.\n120 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nObtaining access to the best people also means rethinking what\nis done in-house and what can be reached outside government. AirForce intelligence, for instance, faces this challenge in trading depthfor breadth. Given the demands of the current business, there sim-ply is no time to \u201ctrain up\u201d an analyst on a new current \u201chot-button\u201dissue with any serious depth. Existing programs for reaching outsideonly scratch the surface of what will be needed. For instance, the NICis addressing the outsourced-expert issue through its NIC AssociatesProgram, which preestablishes ties to subject-matter experts in criti-cal areas throughout the world and facilitates their use to address keyintelligence challenges. The program expanded in recent years, num-bering approximately 160 experts in 2008.\nA similar program \u2013 the Science and Technology Experts Program\n(STEP) \u2013 has been underway for several years, although with the sameconcerns about size and scope of the program relative to demand. Ascurrently con\ufb01gured, the STEP provides the NIC and other agencieswith access to a few dozen organizations with subject-matter expertsin key areas of science and technology. This resource may be tappedfor speci\ufb01c advice on intelligence problems. However, the resourceis primarily amenable to limited-scope efforts of short duration. Pro-gram activities are manifestly consultative or advisory in nature andare dif\ufb01cult to translate into improved core capabilities for the intelli-gence community.\nIntelligence needs to open new ways for lateral entry; in this regard,\nthe NIC experience is indicative. In many areas, such as top-\ufb02ighteconomists, the government is and will continue to be hard-pressedto compete with the private sector. The government will have dif\ufb01-culty attracting and retaining such talent for a career. However, theNIC has recruited that talent for several-year stints: top-\ufb02ight profes-sionals, many of whom have no more worlds to conquer where theyare, are motivated by a combination of patriotism and a desire to seehow the government works.\nintelligence at home . . . and abroad?\nIn the wake of September 11, there were calls for creating adomestic-intelligence service. U.S. Senator Bob Graham (D-FL) wasrepresentative of those calls: \u201cI think [it is time] to look seriously at\nThe Agenda Ahead 121\nan alternative [to the FBI approach], which is to do as ...m a n y o t h e r\nnations have done, and that is to put their domestic intelligence ina non\u2013law enforcement agency.\u201d\n34Indeed, the joint congressional\ninvestigation into the September 11 attacks recommended that theBush administration \u201cconsider promptly ...w h e t h e r t h e F B I s hould\ncontinue to perform the domestic intelligence functions of the UnitedStates Government or whether legislation is necessary to remedythis problem, including the possibility of creating a new agency toperform those functions.\u201d\n35\nLooking back at September 11, the villains were precisely those\nlegacies outlined in Chapter 3 \u2013 the \u201copposition\u201d in mission and oper-ating style separating intelligence and law enforcement and, espe-cially, the FBI as captive to a law enforcement approach to the world.As the 9/11 Commission stated, the Bureau focused its resources on\u201cafter-the-fact investigations of major terrorist attacks in order todevelop criminal cases.\u201d\n36Agents were \u201ctrained to build cases [and]\ndeveloped information in support of their own cases, not as part of abroader more strategic [intelligence] effort.\u201d\nBy this argument, the FBI was cleft on the stick of diverging mis-\nsions. It was and was likely to remain \u2013 and perhaps should remain \u2013what it was good at: primarily case-based law enforcement.\n37Yet,\npursuing cases the way the FBI did, even intelligence cases, simplyseemed contrary to building a comprehensive intelligence picture. Ifthe FBI identi\ufb01ed a suspected terrorist in connection with a Hamasinvestigation, for example, the suspect would be labeled a Hamas ter-rorist with relevant information kept in a separate \u201cHamas\u201d \ufb01le thatwould be easily accessible to and routinely used only by \u201cHamas\u201d-focused FBI investigators and analysts. The UBLU would be unlikelyto know about the FBI\u2019s interest in that individual. In the case ofMoussaoui, when agents from the local \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce began in August2001 to investigate his \ufb02ying lessons at a Norman, Oklahoma, \ufb02ightschool, they did so in ignorance that the same \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce had beeninterested in the same \ufb02ight school two years earlier because a manthought to be bin Laden\u2019s pilot had trained there.\nThe FBI and its director, Robert Mueller \u2013 who had been on the\njob only one week before the September 11 attacks \u2013 were keenlyaware of the pressure to cede domestic intelligence to a new agency.Mueller moved quickly to reorient the Bureau toward prevention and\n122 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nintelligence, sending his reorganization plan to Congress in Novem-ber 2001. He moved to centralize the management of the Bureau\u2019scounterterrorism program by terminating the of\ufb01ce-of-origin systemfor terrorism cases. Instead, headquarters personnel oversaw all ter-rorism cases, regardless of where they originated. Arthur Cummings,SAC for counterterrorism at the Washington \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce, explainedthe rationale for centralization: \u201cThere is no such thing as a local ter-rorism problem. Something might happen locally, but within two sec-onds, you discover national and international connections.\u201d\n38SACs\nhad been the barons but were now required to cede power to thecenter.\nAs the FBI grew in budget and size, it also increased the number of\nJTTFs \u2013 bringing together FBI agents, state and local law enforcementof\ufb01cials, and representatives from other federal agencies to investi-gate terrorism cases \u2013 from 34 to 101 throughout the country. Yet, theJTTFs remained primarily in the business of investigation, especially\nbecause FBI Director Mueller promised after September 11 that notip would go unpursued. To a considerable extent, the JTTFs soughtto decon\ufb02ict investigations by assigning them to a particular federal,state, or local agency and then ensuring that they did not cross inharmful ways.\nIn May 2003, Mueller created a more independent Of\ufb01ce of Intelli-\ngence, hiring Maureen Baginski from the NSA and naming her EADof Intelligence, reporting directly to the deputy director. Her mandatewas to create state-of-the-art processes and standards for intelligence-gathering throughout the Bureau; \ufb01nd and prioritize gaps in intelli-gence; and evaluate \ufb01eld-of\ufb01ce performance in closing those gaps.Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs) in each \ufb01eld of\ufb01ce would analyzeand disseminate intelligence, and they would serve as a central pointof contact for intelligence among \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces working on related casesas well as between them and headquarters. In some \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces, how-ever, the role of FIGs remained ambiguous and ill de\ufb01ned \u2013 in part,re\ufb02ecting the powerful legacy of agents and law enforcement. TheWMD Commission worried that intelligence still lacked clout: \u201cTheDirectorate of Intelligence may \u2018task\u2019 the \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces to collect againstcertain requirements ...[ b u t ] i t s \u2018 t a s k i n g s \u2019 a r e r e a l l y \u2018 a s k i n g s . \u2019 \u201d\n39In\nearly 2005, only 38 of the Bureau\u2019s 1,720 intelligence analysts workedwithin the DI itself.\nThe Agenda Ahead 123\nThe next stage of reorganization, in 2005, put the expanded Of\ufb01ce\nof Intelligence back together with Counterintelligence and Countert-errorism in the NSB, as the Bureau quickly embraced the recommen-dation of the WMD Commission. In effect, the FBI created a ser-vice within a service but without the formal personnel track to match.Later, the Bureau created an intelligence career track (one of \ufb01ve) forspecial agents as part of its more general effort to upgrade the statusof intelligence within the organization.\n40\nThere is no gainsaying the dif\ufb01culty of the FBI\u2019s transformation.\nFor intelligence-gathering, for example, it means to look \u201cat threats inthe U.S. and determine how to address gaps in our understandings ofthose threats\u201d \u2013 the words of Philip Mudd, who moved from the CIAto become the \ufb01rst deputy at the NSB. Following cases, those typicallyopened in reaction to some incident or tip, might lead to an arrest butmight also leave dangerous gaps in the FBI\u2019s intelligence about ter-rorist threats. Instead, agents should work with analysts to \u201cmap theirdomains,\u201d assess the potential threats in a region, and then build anintelligence-gathering strategy to mitigate those threats. Joseph Ford,the FBI\u2019s de facto chief operating of\ufb01cer, described the shift:\nWith this new approach, we want agents to ask if the issue that just poppedinto their in-box [as a conventional case] is more important than \ufb01lling a criti-cal intelligence gap. It\u2019s all about forcing them to make these tough but impor-tant choices about how to spend your time and resources.\n41\nChanging the Bureau\u2019s approach would not be easy. In Mudd\u2019s\nwords, \u201cThere are thirty-one thousand employees in this organizationand we\u2019re undergoing a sea-change. It\u2019s going to take a while for whatis a high-end national security program to sink down to every of\ufb01-cer.\u201d\n42By interview accounts, in many \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces, the FIGs and their\nintelligence analysts are becoming valued members of FBI squads \u2013and not just in counterterrorism. By the same accounts, they con-tinue to be torn because what their immediate \ufb01eld colleagues needmost is operational support, while headquarters is eager to have themdevelop broader intelligence and threat analyses.\nFor the time being, the nation\u2019s political leaders were persuaded\nto give the FBI a chance to reshape the Bureau\u2019s mission. The WMDCommission had considered but then rejected the idea in favor of theservice-within-a-service structure, regarding the hybrid nature of the\n124 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nCollection Analysis Action\nFigure 5.1. Core functions of domestic intelligence.\nFBI as a strength. Mueller and his colleagues, at least at the top, werecommitted to a fundamental change in mission and practice. Terror-ism is a matter for both intelligence and law enforcement, and nowthe wall that used to separate the two \u2013 including the wall that existedwithin the FBI \u2013 has been all but erased. Of\ufb01cials seeking intelligencecan share information with colleagues who are investigating a crimi-nal case. To both commissions, and to the body politic, the mid-2000s,less than a decade into the age of terror, did not seem the right timeto tear apart that incipient cooperation by creating a separate intelli-gence agency outside the FBI.\nthinking about a separate domestic-intelligence service43\nHowever, the issue of creating a separate domestic-intelligence ser-vice will not go away, and it will come powerfully to the agenda ifthere is another serious terrorist attack on the United States. To someextent, the issue serves as a focal point for a cluster of issues aboutdomestic intelligence, many of which are not signi\ufb01cantly affected bythe form of an organization. Consider Figure 5.1, which illustrates thecore functions of domestic intelligence.\nFunction by function, it is noteworthy that collection depends only\nin part on organization. How much is collected depends more on how\nmuch money is spent and how large the collectors are than on whichform of organization does the collecting. By the same token, how\ncollection is accomplished depends more on which guidelines are ineffect and which capabilities are provided than on the speci\ufb01c orga-nizations involved. What is collected could well be affected by the\nchoice of organization because, as the Mudd quote suggested, a pureintelligence service might give more attention to \ufb01lling out the mapof the domain and less to following speci\ufb01c leads than would a hybridintelligence\u2013LEA; indeed, that would be the main point of creating aseparate agency.\nThe Agenda Ahead 125\nSuch a service presumably would not have arrest or other \u201caction\u201d\nauthority; thus, that function is irrelevant. With regard to informationstorage, organizational form does not seem to matter much becausethe question would be whether a new agency became the focal pointfor databases and other information storage or simply one moreagency storing information \u2013 which is more a question of policy thanorganization. The same is true in moving information \u2013 \u201cWould a newagency become a focal point for what is called information-sharing orjust one more sharer?\u201d \u2013 except in one critical detail.\nThat particular detail is moving information back and forth across\nthe intelligence\u2013law enforcement \u201cseam.\u201d That seam exists no mat-ter what the organization because at some point, a decision has to bemade about whether a speci\ufb01c suspected terrorist group may be closeenough to attack so that information-gathering should cease and lawenforcement tactics should roll up the group. To make that decision,intelligence and law enforcement of\ufb01cials have to be in close con-tact long before \u2013 whether they work in the same or separate orga-nizations. After September 11, given the FBI drive to reshape itselfand erasure of the wall, the United States decided, implicitly at least,that having intelligence and law enforcement in the same agency hadadvantages in working across that seam.\nIt is in analysis where the choice of organizational form would\nappear to matter most because that is where the gap between intelli-gence and law enforcement is the widest. In a law enforcement organi-zation, the purpose of information is prosecution; what is not relevantto a possible case is not relevant. In such circumstances, those whoprovide and process information \u2013 that is, analysts \u2013 are rewarded forinformation that leads to prosecution and conviction.\nBy contrast, for intelligence, the purpose is to provide a mosaic of\nunderstanding of the threat \u2013 \u201cmapping the domain\u201d in Mudd\u2019s lan-guage; thus, a piece of information that was irrelevant to a particularprosecution, if stored away, may provide the invaluable piece to themosaic months or even years hence. To that end, analysts should berewarded for valuable contributions to that mapping \u2013 plainly, a lesstangible metric than for information that leads to a conviction. Notonly would a domestic-intelligence service conduct and reward anal-ysis differently than a law enforcement organization, it probably alsowould recruit a somewhat different set of professionals. It would seek\n126 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\na wider set of skills including, for instance, historians, anthropologists,and country or regional specialists.\nIt is interesting that virtually all of the United States\u2019 closest friends\nabroad have domestic-intelligence services separate from nationallaw enforcement.\n44National context matters enormously, especially\nin comparisons with the United States, which is more than threetimes larger than any of the six countries in this survey \u2013 Britain,Canada, France, Germany, Australia, and Switzerland \u2013 and with amore diverse federal system. That said, the other countries suggest,\ufb01rst, several potential advantages of having a dedicated domestic-intelligence service, as follows:\nrServices with no functional law enforcement powers of arrest ordetention can devote the totality of their resources to preemptiveinformation-gathering, analysis, and dissemination. By compari-son, the FBI\u2019s \u201ccase-based\u201d culture and tendency to select leadersfrom law enforcement run the risk that its intelligence function willtake a secondary role to its policing responsibilities.\n45\nrWith no immediate requirement for prosecutions, the services canconcentrate on long-term surveillance of terrorist suspects, try-ing to foster what might be called a \u201cculture of prevention\u201d withrespect to political extremism.\n46For instance, threat assessments\nhave been a major stock-in-trade of most of the services, and sev-eral are the drivers of interagency threat-assessment processes in away that the FBI is not.\nrThe lack of police power may make it easier to develop communityliaisons, as especially the Australian and Canadian services havedone. These activities not only give the services a more public face,they also can be a \u201cforce multiplier\u201d in enhancing the potentialscope of national surveillance efforts and in affording a direct con-duit for assessing the residual threat emanating from homegrownextremism. These overt contacts add to what is provided by infor-mants in foreign-minority communities.\nrThey may be able to draw on a wider, more diverse recruitmentpool. More speci\ufb01cally, they are perhaps more able to attract indi-viduals who would not normally be interested in entering a lawenforcement profession, such as linguists, historians, social scien-tists, psychologists, economists, and country and regional experts.\nThe Agenda Ahead 127\nrThe division between intelligence and law enforcement, perhapssomewhat paradoxically, has compelled the creation of domes-tic coordinating mechanisms across that seam, which, in turn, hasspurred the institution of wider, integrated antiterrorism plans.Rather than blurring the wall, the continued separation requiresagencies that work on both sides of the wall to understand in detailthe requirements and working habits of the other side.To be sure, it is dif\ufb01cult to judge how much of this is the effect\nof having separate police and intelligence agencies and how muchof it stems from smaller size and from history. British arrangementslook impressive: \u201cBritain Counterterrorism, Inc.\u201d Yet, while the coremay be a domestic-intelligence service without police power, Britainis only a \ufb01fth of the population of the United States, and its inter-nal cooperation stems from a nearly forty-year history of dealing withterrorists in Northern Ireland, England, and abroad.\nPerhaps the most relevant experience is that of America\u2019s imme-\ndiate neighbor, Canada. Like the FBI, the Royal Canadian MountedPolice (RCMP) combined policing and intelligence. In parallel withthe FBI\u2019s COINTELPRO, it was revealed that the RCMP SecurityService (RCMP-SS) harassed the separatist Parti Qu \u00b4eb\u00b4ecois: stealing\nmail; breaking into of\ufb01ces; illegally opening mail; burning a barn inQuebec where the Black Panther Party and Front de Lib \u00b4eration du\nQu\u00b4ebec were rumored to be planning a rendezvous; forging docu-\nments; and conducting illegal electronic surveillance.\nIn response, a Royal Commission, the McDonald Commission,\ninvestigated and recommended the creation of a separate intelligenceservice.\n47The Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS)\nbegan operations in 1984. In effect, the United States and Canadahad come to the same pass, both realizing that their domestic-securityarms had imposed their own view of what the nation\u2019s securityimplied, but then they divided over action to take. For the UnitedStates, the solution was the famous wall; for Canada, it was a sepa-rate service. The primary argument for creating the CSIS was legal:to have clear legislation and detailed oversight. However, a secondaryargument was concerned with effectiveness: absent major terrorismor a spy scandal, the RCMP-SS would lose in the internal competitionfor resources to the Mounties\u2019 main law enforcement mission. It was\n128 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nlikely to suffer a boom and bust cycle as terrorism and spying rose andfell on the public\u2019s agenda of concern.\nThe principal negative from the experiences of other countries is\nthat for all the various initiatives, integrating intelligence and lawenforcement in the \ufb01ght against terrorism remains a parlous enter-prise. Of course, having a separate service is no panacea for inter-agency con\ufb02ict: Britain\u2019s MI-5 domestic-intelligence service and theMetropolitan Police Special Branch argued for years over whichwould take the lead in intelligence operations on the British main-land against Irish Republican terrorism. Operationally, how to collectinformation for evidentiary purposes while simultaneously protectingthe identity of covert sources and surveillance/monitoring methodsremains a problem. Tactical intelligence for immediate law enforce-ment purposes is different than strategic intelligence about threats.The difference is re\ufb02ected in the inherent tension between continu-ing to gather intelligence on suspicious activity, on the one hand, androlling up that activity through law enforcement (or another disrup-tion) on the other.\nIn that sense, the FBI hybrid model may be attractive in quickly\nmoving information across the seam, from information-gathering toactionable law enforcement, because its transformation still renders ita case-based culture but seeks to view those cases as collection plat-forms as well as law enforcement units. There may be bene\ufb01t to hav-ing one agency deal with particular cases, using \u201ccase\u201d broadly \u2013 from\u201cgrain to bread,\u201d as the Swedish service puts it.\nDevelopments in the arrangement of America\u2019s foreign partners\nsuggest that bene\ufb01t. Britain has launched regional task forces, seek-ing to better integrate MI-5 and the police, and France\u2019s Direction de\nla Surveillance du Territoire (DST), or Territorial Surveillance Direc-\ntorate, is set to integrate Renseignements Generaux , or General Intel-\nligence, which is a police intelligence unit akin to the Special Branch ofBritain\u2019s Metropolitan Police. Of course, the creation of a domestic-intelligence agency, whatever its merits, cannot in and of itself addressthe larger problem of working across the intelligence\u2013law enforce-ment seam, in deciding on action as well as in continuing to shareinformation.\nBy the same token, whether systems for oversight and accountabil-\nity are easier or more effective with a separate domestic-intelligence\nThe Agenda Ahead 129\nservice is dif\ufb01cult to disentangle from history, culture, and size. Theexperiences of other countries, along with the COINTELPRO his-tory, suggest that domestic intelligence might be better and safer fordemocracy if it were separate, not the tail of a law enforcement dog,which was the Canadian argument for the CSIS.\nConversely, the lack of any effective parliamentary oversight over\nFrance\u2019s DST could be seen as a separate service\u2019s successful argu-ment for more autonomy. However, again, that lack of oversight prob-ably has more to do with the speci\ufb01cs of the French case than withanything inherent in fashioning a separate domestic-intelligence ser-vice. The Cold War history of Communist Party members in govern-ing majorities raised the fear that any parliamentary oversight wouldleak sensitive information to Moscow.\nMoreover, the context of all the countries is not only less federal\nthan that of the United States, it also tends to be one in which citizensare generally less skeptical of their governments and more inclinedto defer to its powers. To be sure, the point should not be over-stated \u2013 yet, Australia, which often seems closer to the United Statesthan Continental Europe, speaks to it. In Australia, for instance, theenabling act empowers the head of the domestic intelligence serviceto decide the strategic direction of the agency and to determine whatdoes and does not constitute a legitimate target for surveillance. Since2003, so called Questioning Warrants have accorded intelligence of\ufb01-cers a limited right to detain, interrogate, and hold terrorist suspectswithout charging them with a speci\ufb01c offense. Taken together, theseprovisions, in practice, produced an intelligence service that is notonly self-tasking but also quasi-executive in nature.\nNeither is a separate service any guarantee against abuse: witness\nboth COINTELPRO and the RCMP-SS. Purely domestic-intelligenceservices have been abused for political purposes. In several countries,including Britain and France, the services have been accused of spy-ing for political purposes, particularly on \ufb01gures of the political left.In the case of France, domestic and foreign intelligence was mixedand used by leading politicians to bolster their political arguments.At a minimum, the other countries\u2019 experiences highlight the needfor appropriate \ufb01rewalls, more so now that the principal wall thatseparated intelligence and law enforcement has been dismantled inthe United States. To be sure, \ufb01rewalls can hamper operations by\n130 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nmaking it more dif\ufb01cult to work across the seam from foreign ordomestic intelligence to law enforcement, but the experiences abroadat least reinforce the old lesson that the United States learned aboutthe risks of bypassing mainstream intelligence structures and normaloversight bodies.\nIn the end, perhaps the most powerful downside of creating a sep-\narate domestic intelligence service in the United States would be thetransition costs. Purely practically, it would have all the growing painsof any new agency \u2013 pains on vivid view at DHS \u2013 and additionallywould need to duplicate the range of of\ufb01ces and infrastructure thatthe FBI now has.\n48Critically, the existing FBI JTTF infrastructure,\nboth physical and human, for reaching out to state and local author-ities either would or would not move to a new agency. If it did not,the new agency would have to create it afresh; if it did, the FBI wouldhave to re-create it for law enforcement purposes.\nThe history of government reorganization in the United States is\neloquent about the fact that the results are political compromises,those that may re\ufb02ect what no party intended. In the words of oneseminal study: \u201cAmerican public bureaucracy is not designed to beeffective. The bureaucracy arises out of politics, and its design re\ufb02ectsthe interests, strategies, and compromises of those who exercise politi-cal power.\u201d\n49There would be a host of questions about where it would\nbe located: Justice, DHS, or somewhere else? Or should it be a servicewithin a service, like the FBI\u2019s NSB but with distinct career tracksfor counterterrorism and intelligence and even more autonomy that isbeing created for the NSB \u2013 a kind of MI-5 within the FBI?\nCritically, to return to the functions cycle outlined previously, how\nbig would it be and with what authorities? How could it be con-structed to make it more likely to become the hub of information andinformation-sharing \u2013 and not just one more agency trying to get inon the act? How high and wide would its bureaucracy be, with whatlatitude for selecting and training professionals? How many politicalappointees would it have? As always in life, the devil would be in thedetails, and those details themselves would be political compromises.\nWhen RAND assembled a panel of distinguished experts and for-\nmer practitioners to assess the nation\u2019s existing arrangements fordomestic intelligence, the assessments were low, none more than 3on a 1-to-5 scale for any dimension of those arrangements.\n50Perhaps\nThe Agenda Ahead 131\nparadoxically, if the experts did not positively assess current arrange-ments, neither were they enthusiastic about possible alternatives.None of the alternatives offered was assessed more than slightly above3, again on a 5-point scale. The highest score was given to the idea ofan autonomous service within an existing agency (a more autonomousversion of the FBI\u2019s existing NSB) \u2013 largely because the experts reck-oned the transition costs for it to be lower than the other alternatives.\nThe paradox suggests that the experts were pessimistic about the\nability of the U.S. government to do much better, were more sanguineabout the threat than some political commentary would have it, orboth in some combination. A kind of \u201cWe\u2019re not doing well but aredoing better and, besides, the near-term threat has been hyped\u201d expla-nation was hinted at by the experts\u2019 response when asked how muchthe risk of terrorism has been reduced since September 11. Notwith-standing their negative assessments of current capabilities, they stillthought the risk had diminished by a third.\nthe next frontier in the age of terror\nWhat foreign countries do can hardly settle the issue of what theUnited States should do. In the end, analytically, the choice princi-pally turns on one main cost, one main bene\ufb01t, and one that could beeither \u2013 none of which can be reduced to a numerical estimate. It isreasonable to believe, given the task and experience of other govern-ment agencies, that the transition cost of creating a separate domestic-intelligence service would be high. The principal bene\ufb01t would bethequality of intelligence collected and analyzed by a separate ded-\nicated agency. The \u201ceither/or\u201d would be whether working across theintelligence\u2013law enforcement seam was reckoned better or worse witha separate agency. To justify the costs, the bene\ufb01t would have to bejudged as considerable, and the either/or a wash or a bene\ufb01t.\nIf foreign experience cannot settle the what for the United States,\nthey are suggestive of how the United States might build a domestic-\nintelligence service if it decides to do so. The experiences of othercountries also can provide useful ideas about how relationships amongfederal, state, and local LEAs can be strengthened. In Canada,for example, the CSIS established a network of regional-liaisonof\ufb01cers, who help facilitate the \ufb02ow of information between local and\n132 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nprovincial police agencies and the federal authorities. The Germanservice, the Federal Of\ufb01ce for the Protection of the Constitution(Bundesamt f \u00a8ur Verfassungsschutz [BfV]) has regional of\ufb01ces in each\nLand (i.e., state) responsible for domestic intelligence and inter-\nnal security, which operate with considerable independence but arelinked to and report back to the federal BfV in Cologne. The BfV\u2019ssingle database is also suggestive in that it provides a repository forall information and intelligence from the various state of\ufb01ces as wellas BfV headquarters, and it does so in a way that is both secure andaccessible to appropriate of\ufb01cials at the local level.\nUltimately, however, the logic of intelligence for an age of terror\nwould drive discussion to a place well beyond where it has gone sofar because that logic destroys not only the wall between intelligenceand law enforcement but also the wall between foreign and domestic.By the logic, the United States should create a new agency that hasboth law enforcement and intelligence functions at home and abroadbut perhaps whose jurisdiction is limited to dealing with internationalterrorist groups targeting Americans.\n51Such an agency would focus\non Al Qaeda, its kin, and descendants wherever they are, aiming toprevent terrorist acts and prosecute terrorists. The new agency wouldbe the clearinghouse for information on the small number of terroristgroups.\nTo be sure, making it easier to work across several seams also\nwould create new seams \u2013 a reminder that there is no ideal orga-nization. Such an agency would have to cooperate in intelligenceabroad with the CIA, and at home with the FBI and others in bothintelligence and law enforcement. It would have to \ufb01nd ways toreach out \u2013 either directly or through the FBI or the DHS \u2013 to stateand local authorities. Presumably, it would have to run the gaunt-let of different approval procedures for both intelligence and lawenforcement, both at home and abroad. The FBI, however, alreadymanages different procedures for intelligence and law enforcement,and the new agency\u2019s relationships with the CIA, the FBI, and otherswould not be much different than, for instance, relationships the FBIalready has with the Secret Service, the Drug Enforcement Admin-istration (DEA), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, andExplosives.\nThe Agenda Ahead 133\nOther nations\u2019 intelligence services have blurred the domestic\u2013\nforeign line. For instance, Canada and Australia, which have ser-vices that were predominantly domestic in orientation, found thattransnational threats such as terrorism required equally transnationalresponses. As a result, both services found they needed to increasetheir activities abroad, and the CSIS has been given authorities forforeign intelligence. In response to the Sikh extremism of the 1980s,for instance, the CSIS began to give pride of place not to counterintel-ligence but rather to counterterrorism. It recruited informants in theSikh community in Canada, but then followed them as they movedabroad. It came to resemble, in fact, what the Netherlands has for-mally \u2013 a single service, the General Intelligence and Security services,with both a domestic and a foreign branch. It is both a security and anintelligence service; in its latter capacity, it operates abroad.\n52\nFor the foreseeable future, however, thinking of integrating for-\neign and domestic intelligence will remain a challenge too great forthe United States. Creating a domestic-intelligence service, however,will remain on the agenda. It is worth thinking about and discussingnow because if such a service were created in the aftermath of a majorterrorist attack on the United States, all bets would be off in the polit-ical panic of the moment. The details that can make a signi\ufb01cant dif-ference could be lost, and the country could be left with domestic-intelligence arrangements that were both more intrusive and less\neffective.\n6\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis\nIf the season of analysis as the object of blue-ribbon panel post-mortems was unusual, so was the scathing language used by both theWMD Commission and the Senate Select Committee in describinganalysis in the run-up to the Iraq war. One critical part of the agendafor reshaping intelligence is analysis, and the need is dramatic. Cur-rent and future threats to the United States such as terrorism areglobal and adaptive, blurring distinctions among crime, terrorism, andwar. Analysts of the future will need to think more like homicidedetectives, trying to see patterns amid incomplete information. Mostimportant, given the asymmetric nature of the threat, future analy-sis becomes net assessment, where understanding \u201cblue\u201d \u2013 what theUnited States is doing \u2013 is as critical as understanding \u201cred,\u201d U.S. foes.However, this runs directly against the powerful norm in U.S. foreignintelligence: \u201cThou shalt not assess America or Americans.\u201d\nIn these circumstances, there are no easy solutions to improving\nanalysis; legislation or reorganization or exhortation cannot producemore creativity. The shortcomings run deep into organizational cul-ture; for instance, most intelligence analysis in the U.S. governmenthas made little use of either machines or formal methods. Thus, thereis no substitute for a rich variety of pilot projects and experiments,many of which involve dramatic departures from current practice. Forinstance, psychologists tell us that harried people are not likely tobe creative; creativity requires having some re\ufb02ective \u201cdown\u201d time.However, intelligence analysts are now frantic all the time; there-fore, creating special units enjoined from immediate production but\n134\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 135\nencouraged to think makes sense, but it cuts against the organizationalgrain.\nImproving analysis requires putting consumers at the center of the\nprocess. Ultimately, analysis is neither information nor elegant papersre\ufb02ecting deep judgment. Rather, it is improved understanding bypeople who have to make a decision. Intelligence, and especially anal-ysis, will not be truly reshaped until it changes how it thinks aboutitsproducts. When I ran the NIC, I realized that NIEs were not our\nreal product; rather, our real product was NIOs \u2013 not paper but ratherpeople \u2013 experts \u2013 in a position to attend meetings and offer judgment.A starting point for the reshaping would be recognizing that \u201canaly-sis\u201d is plural, covering many consumers with many different needs forintelligence.\nRecent failures are the point of departure for this chapter, but\nits aim is to garner for intelligence analysis the lessons of high-performance and learning organizations. The chapter begins with anassessment of recent postmortems and then turns to the dramaticchanges over time in the target of intelligence and how those changesshape the task of analysis. It then looks at attributes theoretically asso-ciated with high-performance and learning organizations and theirimplications for analysis. Finally, it turns to implications from the per-spective not of analysts but rather of consumers : What do they need\nand want from intelligence analysis?\nthe season of postmortems\nThe \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years of the 2000s comprised the season for postmor-tems of failed intelligence analyses, while in most other seasons in\nthe past half-century, it was intelligence operations , especially covert\naction, that typically were the focus of post-failure assessments. Sev-eral of this season\u2019s postmortems were detailed and thoughtful.\n1\nSome of the recommendations, discussed in more detail herein, wereembodied in the 2004 intelligence reform legislation, and others havebeen adopted by the DNI and the various agencies.\n2\nMost of that is all good. Nevertheless, as the legal saying has it,\n\u201chard cases make bad law.\u201d3The social-science equivalent is that sin-\ngle cases \u2013 or a linked series of failures in the 9/11 case \u2013 make idiosyn-cratic lessons; it is too tempting to conclude that if analysts did Xand\n136 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nfailed, then they should do non-X (oranti-X) in order to succeed. All\nof these postmortems tend to carry the presumption that intelligenceanalysis is a singular enterprise. Yet, it is not; it comprises a varietyof purposes and relationships to consumers and, therefore, data andmethods. Intelligence analysis is plural, and so must best practices beplural.\nAs emphasized in Chapter 5, organizations must learn if they are\nto compete. If organizations fail to learn, they risk not staying currentwith a changing world, all the more so when adversaries are contin-ually trying to frustrate the efforts of U.S. intelligence. How shouldthey learn and \u2013 more to the point \u2013 how can they become a learningorganization? The military services, especially the Army, have for-mal lesson-learning organizations \u2013 in the Army\u2019s case, the Centerfor Army Lessons Learned (CALL). The intelligence community hasbeen through no shortage of postmortems: from 9/11 to WMD in Iraq,to the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, to India\u2019s nuclear tests.\n4\nYet, it is far from clear that learning lessons by examining cele-\nbrated cases is the best path. The examinations tend to be rare and inthe full glare of publicity \u2013 and of political stakes. They often focus on\ufb01nding guilty villains to blame as much as improving practice. Even ifthey do not focus on \u201cWho shot \u2013 or who missed \u2013 John?,\u201d they stillare methodologically \ufb02awed. They focus on a handful of incidents,each with its own peculiarities \u2013 but whose lessons are then general-ized to inevitably different circumstances. They tend to assume thatif analysts did Xand failed, then doing do non-X (oranti-X) would\nhave produced success and would do so in future circumstances akinto those examined. By this point, the inquiry is on thin epistemologicalice indeed.\nThe examinations also focus on failures, which have several conse-\nquences. Most obvious, they raise the defenses of those intelligenceorganizations that feel their copybooks are being graded by the exer-cise. It is perhaps little surprise, for example, that the \ufb01rst effortsby the DNI to create a joint lessons-learned center ran into resis-tance from virtually all the analytic agencies. Focusing on failures alsodownplays what might be learned from successes or even middlingoutcomes. The preoccupation with major error may also produce apendulum swing. One reason among several that U.S. intelligenceoverestimated Iraq\u2019s WMD program in 2002 was that it had under-estimated them in 1990 \u2013 and had been taken to task for doing so.\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 137\nPerhaps most important, the assessments are seldom explicit about\nwhat constitutes intelligence failure.5Not every failure is an intelli-\ngence failure; in principle, there could be intelligence successes andpolicy failures. A dramatic example is the NIE on Yugoslavia in theautumn of 1990, which predicted Yugoslavia\u2019s tragedy with a pre-science that is awe-inspiring.\n6It concluded that Yugoslavia\u2019s breakup\nwas inevitable. The breakup would be violent and the con\ufb02ict mightexpand to spill into adjacent regions. Yet, the estimate had no impacton policy whatsoever. None. Senior policy makers did not believe it,or were distracted by the impending collapse of the Soviet Union, ordid not believe they could do anything about it.\nTo the extent that policy of\ufb01cers saw and digested the estimate,\nintelligence could not be said to have failed. To qualify as an intel-ligence failure, \ufb02awed intelligence analysis has to be seen and actedon by policy, leading to a failure. There has to be a decent case thatbetter intelligence would have induced policy of\ufb01cials to take anothercourse, one that was likely to have led to a more successful policy.By that de\ufb01nition, intelligence on Iraqi WMD in 2002 certainly was\ufb02awed, but it may not qualify as an intelligence failure to the extentthat a better estimate, within the bounds of what was possible, proba-bly would not have changed the policy outcome.\nIn these circumstances, most of the quick lessons from the recent\npostmortems are apt. However, they tend to be relatively super\ufb01-cial, reached by wise people who usually are amateurs in the esoter-ica of the trade. For their part, the experts are likely to be seen asbiased, even responsible for the failures at hand, and thus excluded.The lessons of these postmortems are in the nature of reminders thatanalysts might post on their computers, not so much lessons as goodguidance that is too easily forgotten. After the fall of the Shah, bothintelligence and policy re\ufb02ected the major lesson from the case: donot assume that the Shah understands his politics any better than U.S.intelligence does. Both intelligence and policy applied that conclusionto the next similar case: the fall of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philip-pines. In that event, the lesson produced a success.\nBy the same token, intelligence took on board the headline from\nIndia\u2019s nuclear test postmortem: all politics may be local but no lessimportant for it; therefore, take seriously what politicians actuallysay they will do. That lesson may not have been applied forcefullyenough to Osama bin Laden, but intelligence analysts were not likely\n138 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nin any case to repeat the mirror-imaging of the Indian case when it waschild\u2019s play for Americans to assume that India would not test: Whysuffer international opprobrium, even sanctions, when India couldhave its cake and eat it too, being regarded as \u201cnuclear\u201d withouttesting again to force the hand of the international community? BinLaden presented a different challenge; he was too different even tobe seen in the mirror.\nThe headlines from the Iraq WMD case were also reminders mostly\nabout good tradecraft, even good social science: validate sources asmuch as possible and do contrarian analysis (e.g., \u201cWhat is the bestcase that Saddam has noWMD?\u201d). The report on the biggest of all\nrecent failures, September 11, is wonderful history with a strong lessonabout the importance of sharing and integrating information acrossU.S. intelligence organizations, not sequestering or cosseting it. Yet,even that postmortem cannot escape a certain historical determinismto which case histories are vulnerable: everyone knows how the storyended and, knowing that, the pointers along the way are painfullyobvious. It is easy to underestimate the noise in the data or even, inthe case of September 11, the good reasons why the CIA and the FBIdid not share information freely or why the FBI did not go knockingon \ufb02ight-school doors in the summer of 2001.\nMoreover, however valuable these reminders are, they fall short\nof best practice in learning lessons for intelligence. Warfare, in whichlessons-learned activities are becoming commonplace, tends to be anepisodic activity. By contrast, intelligence \u2013 especially in an era ofnonstate as opposed to state-centric threats \u2013 is more continuous.At any one time, intelligence provides estimates of what exists (e.g.,\u201cHow many nuclear weapons does North Korea have?\u201d), what willbe (e.g., \u201cIs India planning to test a nuclear weapon?\u201d), and whatmight be (e.g., \u201cHow would Iran react to the overthrow of Iraq\u2019s gov-ernment?\u201d). Intelligence exists to give policy makers reasoned assess-ments about parameters whose truth value is not otherwise obvious.Much of Cold War intelligence was about what exists: puzzle-solving,looking for additional pieces to \ufb01ll out a mosaic of understandingwhose broad shape was a given. By contrast, intelligence and policyare now engaged in a joint and continuing process of trying to under-stand the terrorist target in the absence of convenient frames of refer-ence.\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 139\nAt any point in time, the intelligence agencies are assessing an\narray of enumerable possibilities, each of which can be assigned alikelihood. An NIE is a consolidated likelihood estimate of selectedparameters. Such estimates are not (or, at least, should not be) static.To be valuable, each must be open to adjustment in the face of newinformation or reconsideration. Recall my CIA friend and colleague:\u201cWe\u2019re all Bayesians now.\u201d The November 2007 NIE on Iran is dis-cussed in more detail in Chapter 7. Whatever its shortcomings in ask-ing the right question, the NIE\u2019s tradecraft was careful, and it clearlyannounced that intelligence\u2019s judgment had been altered in light ofnew information.\nSometimes, the new information \ufb01xes the estimate \ufb01rmly (e.g.,\nIndia tests a nuclear weapon). More commonly, each event can in\ufb02u-ence the con\ufb01dence with which an estimate is held. The analyst\u2019s art,and one in which the ability to learn lessons is valuable, is in collect-ing the right facts, developing or choosing the right rule for integratingthose facts, and generating the right conclusions from the combinationof facts and rules.\nThis art can be considered a process, and the goal of a lessons-\nlearned capability is to improve the process continually. Toyota, theautomobile company famous for its success in implementing qualitycontrol in manufacturing, calls the process of continuous improve-ment kaizen, which is critical to its success.\n7How does such a process\nwork? It is Bayesian in the sense outlined in Chapter 2.\nConsider, for instance, an estimate of the likelihood that Iraq had\na serious nuclear weapons program. New evidence was then foundof Iraqi commerce in aluminum tubes. This evidence had to be inter-preted and, once interpreted, it should have affected the judgment ofwhether Iraq had a serious nuclear weapons program. Conversely, ifanother week went by in which inspectors again failed to \ufb01nd a seri-ous nuclear weapons program in Iraq, that event should have reducedthe belief that such a program existed (by how much is another ques-tion). Perhaps needless to add, success at \ufb01nding the information thatwould make the greatest potential difference in those estimates is acritical measure of success for intelligence, but only because it feedsthe estimates.\nThere are many formal, mathematical approaches to making infer-\nences.\n8However, they are not panaceas and tend to be more useful\n140 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nin more complex problems involving great uncertainty and multiplevariables (e.g., estimates, forecasts, and warnings) rather than thoseinvolving interpretive reporting of events underway. Human judg-ment is and will remain the core of the analyst\u2019s art. Yet, there cer-tainly is analytic value in at least being explicit about the inputs toan assessment and how they were treated. At a minimum, explicit-ness permits the validity of such assessments to be scrutinized beforethird parties. Intelligence analysts should compare their estimatesover time; for example, \u201cHow do last month\u2019s events alter my estimateabout the likelihood of any particular outcome in North Korea?\u201d\nHaving noted such deliberations, it is easier to discover why the\nprocesses succeeded or went awry. If they went awry, where? Was itthe failure to collect evidence and, if so, what kind? Was it the mis-leading template that was used to process the evidence and, if so, inwhat way? Which unexamined assumptions were made in generatingthe estimate?\n9Was it the failure to integrate properly the evidence\ninto the estimate and, if so, what kind of failure?\nThe process might start by making explicit the following issues:\nrWhat is believed to be true and with what probability or degree ofcertainty?\nrWhat is believed to be not true (i.e., things that are unlikely to hap-pen; e.g., many intelligence failures arise because possibilities suchas the fall of the Soviet Union are simply not given enough cre-dence to be evaluated systematically)?\nrAmong the many indicators tracked, what is deemed to be moreor less important to support or discon\ufb01rm a judgment? Many intel-ligence failures arise not from failure to predict events per se butrather the failure to realize the signi\ufb01cance \u2013 the predictive value \u2013of antecedents or triggers.\nrIf a particular estimate is true, which indicators would be observ-able and supportive, and which discon\ufb01rming indicators should notbe observable (or have evidence that is not credible)?\nrWhat are the conditional, if\u2013then assumptions by which evidenceis interpreted to support or discon\ufb01rm estimates? For example, ifrulers are known to commit atrocities, then their national stand-ing will decline. Furthermore, which facts or established principles(e.g., evidence from this situation, the history of other situations, or\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 141\nvalidated psychological theories of attitude and behavior change)should cause analysts to doubt the validity of these assumptions?\nrWhich rules of thumb are used to assess how much a correct esti-mate matters in the sense that such a judgment (1) would changepolicies, programs, or operations if there were better intelligenceand (2) such changes would have made a difference to nationalsecurity or comparably signi\ufb01cant outcomes?Explicitness can serve two purposes. It can display the continu-\nous nature of the intelligence process, making plain that the processsustains an array of estimates, not unlike currency markets, whichare ever-changing around the clock. The more operational reason forexplicitness is to make it easier to review the process by which assess-ments are generated. In that sense, explicitness is like the \ufb02ight datarecorder in an aircraft or the log \ufb01le on a computer process. Explic-itness \u2013 if adequately captured as part of the development of an esti-mate \u2013 can be useful even if feedback on many estimates comes longafter the fact, if at all.\nfrom traditional to transnational targets\nThe starting point for thinking about reshaping analysis is the obser-vation that while the manner in which the United States analyzedstate-centric targets may have been appropriate during the Cold War,those methods are not appropriate now when transnational threatsare at least as important as state-centric threats (see Chapter 2).Table 6.1 highlights the differences and suggests how best practicesneed to be reshaped, driven by the focus of analysis, and then encom-pass organization and work\ufb02ow, sources and methods, and analysts\u2019characteristics.\n10\nTraditional intelligence as practiced during the Cold War focused\non nation-states; nonstate or \u201ctransnational\u201d actors were secondary.Now, the priority is reversed, as discussed in Chapter 2, and the prin-cipal targets are nonstates, like Al Qaeda. States are of interest asfacilitators of terrorism either willingly or because they lose controlof their territory. Chapter 2 also describes the differences betweenstate and nonstate actors as targets of intelligence. There is much lessshared story about nonstates, which come in many sizes and shapes;\n142 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 6.1.

Understanding them isless bounded; more outcomes are possible. Because many state tar-gets, such as the Soviet Union and Iraq, were secretive, intelligence\u2019ssecret sources were critical. Terrorist groups are hardly open; there-fore, secrets still matter. However, signals about bad people or badweapons are also there to be ferreted out of the vast \u201cnoise\u201d ofcustoms declarations or motor-vehicle records, not to mention Webchat rooms. The Soviet Union was not only hierarchical but alsoponderous; discontinuities in its behavior were rare. Al Qaeda hasbeen shown to be patient; however, discontinuities in the terrorist\n144 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthreat \u2013 new groups or new weapons or new modes of attack \u2013 areall too possible. Finally, and perhaps most important, while Sovietbehavior on many issues (for starters) could be assumed to be rel-atively independent of what the United States did \u2013 recall Brown\u2019squote about Soviet nuclear programs \u2013 the interaction of what we doand how terrorists respond is more consequential. After all, terrorismis the tactic of the weak; thus, terrorists cannot be understood in isola-tion from what we are doing to counter them. Even the capabilities ofthe terrorists turn on us. The 9/11 hijackers did not come to their tacticas a preference; rather, they chose it because they had found seams inour defenses.\nIntelligence analysis was not only stovepiped by agency, it also was\norganized hierarchically. Fritz Ermarth, a former chair of the NIC,once mused: \u201cWhy, at the turn of the millennium, is intelligence anal-ysis still organized like the Roman legions?\u201d Intelligence, analysis inparticular, needs to be in \ufb02at and highly networked organizations. Inthat sense, the main 9/11 Commission recommendation other than thecreation of the DNI \u2013 to organize the analytic part of the intelligencecommunity around issues in \u201ccenters,\u201d perhaps more virtual than real,\nwith the NCTC as the model \u2013 is the right direction. However, it car-ries the risk of increasing the urgency of the immediate.\nIn understanding terrorism, in contrast to the states of the Cold\nWar, the need for collaboration is greater, not just across sources orspecialties in federal intelligence agencies but also with foreign part-ners and with state and local of\ufb01cials. Intelligence\u2019s customers alsowere limited during the Cold War, mostly politico\u2013military of\ufb01cialsof the federal government. Now, intelligence is called on to servea wider range of consumers \u2013 from foreign partners of the UnitedStates, which may have access to places and people we do not, to pri-vate citizens who own the national infrastructure that terrorists maytarget \u2013 and intelligence is often linked to action on a continuing basis.\nDuring the decade-long lull between the Cold War and the war on\nterrorism, intelligence\u2019s budgets declined and its deep expertise on theSoviet Union dispersed. To be sure, public rhetoric often exaggeratesthe decline. Both political parties sought a \u201cpeace dividend\u201d after theCold War, but most of that dividend came from defense. For its part,intelligence, whose budgets had risen faster than defense in the 1970sand 1980s, declined more slowly in the 1990s. The counterterrorism\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 145\nmission took only a small hit; indeed, its budget began to grow rapidlyafter the \ufb01rst World Trade Center attack in 1993.\n12\nAt the same time as budgets tapered down, intelligence needed\nnew customers and new missions. It found new customers, especiallyin economic agencies like the Department of Commerce. Those newcustomers were interested mostly in immediate support, more likestaff work than longer term analysis. With more customers and fewerresources, the intelligence agencies were hard-pressed to keep up withthe \ufb02ood of short-term questions they were asked. Because intel-ligence is in the service business, turning away new customers orsloughing off old ones is painful; what got squeezed was the capac-ity to accomplish deeper analysis.\nThe lament of insiders was quoted in Chapter 5: \u201cWe now do\nreporting, we used to do analysis.\u201d The dominance of question-answering is pervasive, even where it would not be expected. Theintelligence agencies of the military services, for instance, report thatthey spend as much as half their time answering speci\ufb01c, usually short-run, questions, not doing their traditional job of assessing the mili-tary capacities of potential U.S. foes. The \u201ccrown-jewel analysis,\u201d thePDB, is jokingly referred to as \u201cCNN plus secrets.\u201d It isvery current,\noften a new piece of secret information, although analysts do add com-mentary to put that information in context. Answering questions froma wide variety of customers may be done best with generalist analysts;however, longer term understanding requires deep specialists.\nIn fact, intelligence needs to do both; it needs to answer immediate\nquestions and open space for longer term thinking. Both will requiredramatic changes in the way intelligence does its business. Instead ofrelying heavily on secret sources, intelligence has to reach out to awide variety of sources. In a world of secret sources, analysts couldbe separated from intelligence collectors; in the world of the Web,analysts are also their own collectors. In that world of secrets, analystswere mostly passive users of the information that was delivered totheir computer screens; now, they need to actively search and questiondata, something that comes naturally to the younger generation thathas grown up on Google.\nThe challenges to analytic practice from changing targets \u2013 less\nboundedness and more uncertainty, no shared story, more contin-gency on our actions, and too much information of widely varying\n146 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nreliability13\u2013 can be sharpened by dividing analytic issues into the\nfollowing three types, which are outlined in Chapter 2:\nrPuzzles . These are questions that could be answered with certainty\nif only with access to information that, in principle, is available.Dave Snowden, in his business-related writing about the philoso-phy of information, calls them known problems, for which there is\na unique relationship between causes and effects.\n14The challenge\nis to correctly categorize the problem, obtain the necessary data tosolve it, and apply accepted formulas. Military-targeting issues arepuzzles; so are many issues about capabilities. Much of Cold Warintelligence was puzzle-solving: looking for additional pieces to \ufb01llout a mosaic of understanding whose broad shape was a given.\nrMysteries. No evidence can de\ufb01nitively settle these mysteriesbecause they typically are about people, not things. They are con-tingent. Snowden labels these knowable problems, which involve\ncontingent relationships between a limited set of causes and effects.In this realm, analytic techniques can be used to predict out-comes, at least probabilistically. Russia\u2019s in\ufb02ation rate for this yearis a mystery; so is whether North Korea will dismantle and aban-don its nuclear program. While Soviet capabilities were primarily apuzzle, those of terrorist groups are a mystery because they dependuntil the last moment on the actions and vulnerabilities of theirfoes.\nrComplexities. These are mysteries-plus, involving a wide array of\ncauses and effects that can interact in a variety of contingent ways.Large numbers of relatively small actors respond to a shifting set ofsituational factors. Moreover, because interactions re\ufb02ect uniquecircumstances, they do not necessarily repeat in any establishedpattern and are thus not amenable to predictive analysis in thesame way as mysteries. To be sure, the distinction between transna-tional and traditional intelligence problems should not be over-stated: there are some state-to-state problems, such as battle\ufb01eldsituations or crisis diplomacy, in which situationally driven inter-actions among a large number of players can also produce a widevariety of outcomes.The analytic products and some of the processes that produce them\ndiffer across these types of problems. For puzzles, the product is the\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 147\nanswer: North Korea has Xnuclear weapons; Soviet missiles have Y\nwarheads. To be sure, the answer may not be de\ufb01nitive; it may remaina best estimate. If that is so, however, it is not because of inherentuncertainty. Rather, it is so because information that is available inprinciple is unavailable in fact.\nAs Table 6.1 suggests, in solving puzzles, analysts could work alone\nor in small groups, perhaps specializing in one puzzle piece, suchas understanding Soviet submarine propellers. Relatively traditional,hierarchical organizations could then assemble the various puzzlepieces. As Table 6.1 indicates, U.S. intelligence analysts during theCold War did not make much use of formal tools or methods except intechnical areas.\n15Those analysts operated on the basis of their expe-\nrience or that of their immediate work unit. Previous assessments orpatterns were the point of departure, with analysts looking for infor-mation that would con\ufb01rm those patterns \u2013 a tendency abetted bytime pressure, which drove analysts toward early closure on openissues.\nThe needs of the future are not lost on U.S. intelligence agencies.\nYet, the press of the present is so intense and the legacy of the past sopowerful that innovations so far have been piecemeal, if also promis-ing. Moving toward an organization by center will permit wider vir-tual networks to be put in place. However, those centers will need tobe accompanied by a wide range of experiments and innovations inanalysis. The groups inside intelligence that are thinking beyond theimmediate \u2013 the NIC, for instance, or the CIA\u2019s SAG \u2013 need to bereinforced.\nFor mysteries, the product is a best forecast, perhaps in the form\nof a probability with key factors identi\ufb01ed, as well as how they bearon the estimate. For instance, analysts do not and cannot know whatRussia\u2019s in\ufb02ation rate will be this year. However, from Russia\u2019s expe-rience as well as that of other countries, analysts know which factorswill be important in determining that rate and, at least roughly, howthey will combine to produce it. So, the answer can be conveyed bylaying out those determinants along with quantitative or qualitativeassessments of where they stand and how they are moving, which canlead to a best forecast, along with some bounds of uncertainty. Tosharpen both the forecast and the bounds, sensitivity analyses (e.g.,using scenarios or a variety of quantitative methods) could test theeffects of different levels of determinants on outcomes.\n148 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThe \ufb01rst challenge in dealing with complexities is what, if anything,\nintelligence can say about them, other than to identify them as com-plexities. The goal is to convey a sense of emerging patterns with aneye to reinforcing or disrupting, respectively, positive or adverse pat-terns. Communicating that sense may be dif\ufb01cult in a discrete paperor stream of electrons. Rather, it may be done best with the activeparticipation of policy of\ufb01cials \u2013 for instance, using computer powerto\ufb02y through a wide range of variables and scenarios, looking for pat-\nterns.\n16Such processes run into two familiar obstacles: (1) the canon-\nical separation of intelligence from policy; and (2) the fact that policyof\ufb01cials, in particular, are always hard-pressed for time. Because theproduct is a sharpened sense, the problem is not one simply of com-munication; the sense needs to develop out of shared analytic work.Thus, there is a premium on ways to facilitate that interaction. Thischapter returns to that issue in its conclusion.\ncharacteristics of learning organizations\nThe experience of learning organizations also emphasizes six themesin addition to those discussed in Chapter 5 \u2013 tacit knowledge; freeaccess to information; redundancy as part of organizational design,not waste; simultaneity, not sequence; systems for learning from expe-rience; and continuous innovation.\n17All of these themes are relevant\nto intelligence analysis, at least of some types, and most are foreshad-owed in Table 6.1.\nTacit Knowledge\nTacit knowledge is deeply embedded, often not conscious, dif\ufb01cult-to-articulate knowledge and intuition.\n18It is what a person knows about\none\u2019s own life, work, and subject matter that may not be in aware-ness but is essential to one\u2019s success and therefore to the organiza-tion\u2019s performance. It is derived from direct experience; unrelated toformal learning; nonverbal; outside awareness; and essential to every-day life, leadership, and organizational success. It may become morecritical as intelligence seeks to anticipate complex threats under bothtime pressure and uncertainty. In such circumstances, newly observedqualities of an object or body of data that are unconsciously related to\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 149\npast experience or accumulated patterns \u2013 apperceived \u2013 may triggeran idea. The idea must become stated and then fully articulated as aworking hypothesis to be subjected to explicit analysis.\nHowever, the ironies about tacit knowledge are three. The practical\nvalue of tacit knowledge is in leveraging it for the good of the organi-zation by communicating it to others. Yet, because it is both preverbaland outside people\u2019s conscious awareness (like intuition), it is not sus-ceptible to communication or analysis. Theorists debate whether tacitknowledge can ever be made explicit, codi\ufb01ed, and shared.\n19How-\never, much theory and applied research \u2013 as well as billable consul-tants\u2019 time \u2013 has been devoted to that purpose.\nThe literature on judgment and decision making, especially the\nresearch of Phillip Tetlock, a political psychologist, is cautionary.\n20\nHis work pointed out that hunches, intuition, scenario-planning, andother explanations offered on the basis of reputation (not evidence)stimulate con\ufb01rmation bias (i.e., seeking con\ufb01rmatory data or self-justifying elaborations). Furthermore, he demonstrated in politicalpredictions an inverse correlation between the analyst\u2019s con\ufb01dence inthe judgment and the eventual accuracy of it. Although tacit knowl-edge should be brought into the light, it also warrants a process ofcareful vetting and analysts\u2019 discipline in bringing it into explicit formand subjecting it to inquiry. Tetlock developed a training scheme forcalibrating political judgments, which might be adaptable to makingtacit knowledge explicit.\nHis effort follows in a long tradition of techniques for trying to be\nrigorous about eliciting and displaying subjective judgments \u2013 a tra-dition that goes back to RAND\u2019s creation of the \u201cDelphi\u201d techniquea half-century ago.\n21Policon, FACTIONS, SENTURION, and other\nsimilar methods in the \u201cexpected utility\u201d family of techniques havebeen used in intelligence, sometimes with powerful results.\n22Early in\nthe Clinton administration, for instance, the CIA did a FACTIONSanalysis of what it might take, in policy terms, to persuade Serbianleader Slobodan Milosevic to scale back his objectives in Bosnia. Themidpoint judgment of that analysis \u2013 military strikes on industrialtargets in Serbia proper \u2013 was striking to me, at a time when theadministration was still promoting consensual peacekeeping underUN Article 6 and was years away from the Dayton Peace Accordsand the muscular Intervention Force (IFOR). However, because they\n150 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nare time- and resource-consuming, these more formal methods havebeen regarded by analysts as occasional luxuries, not a regular featureof analysis.\nMoreover, consumers can easily react to their results, and more so\nto unprocessed tacit knowledge, as mere bets rather than as re\ufb01nedanalyses. They can ask, \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d \u2013 or demand,\u201cProve it.\u201d Clever defense lawyers discredit ballistics experts by ask-ing them how they reached their judgment. By the same token, chessmasters can be reduced to middle-weight status by having to explaintheir strategy. For both, the knowledge is tacit, born of comparing thecurrent pattern, almost unconsciously, with a thousand previous cir-cumstances in ways that they themselves would be hard-pressed todescribe. To be sure, the skepticism is warranted; it is both naturaland responsible analytic supervision and policy making to grasp thefoundations of the analysis on which critical policies are staked. Cog-nitively, the task is to use all of the various ways of knowing i nas y n -\nergistic manner to enrich the story for the customer. Tacit knowledgewould be folded in using this approach.\nThe experience of one experiment, the so-called terrorism futures\nmarket, is an intriguing case in point. Developed by the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), it was of\ufb01cially theFutures Markets Applied to Prediction (FutureMAP), a Web-basedmarket in which investors would buy futures on the likelihoods of spe-ci\ufb01c events or conditions occurring in the Middle East. When it cameto light two days before it was to begin enrolling investors, it was over-whelmed in political outrage \u2013 left, right, and center. As then\u2013SenateMinority Leader Tom Daschle (D-SD) said on the Senate \ufb02oor:\u201c...I can\u2019t believe that anybody would seriously propose that we\ntrade in death ...\u201d\n23The next week, however, analysts across the\npolitical spectrum rallied to the idea as a way of using the marketto gain information. Financial analysts bet their own money beforethey are willing to make speci\ufb01c recommendations to clients. In thiscase, too, with uncertainty large and information in short supply,using a futures market to get experts to bet their hunches made goodsense.\nTo ensure adequate and appropriate processing of expert judg-\nments arising as gut feelings or hunches and to deliver defensible\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 151\nproducts, much of analytic tradecraft as it developed in the last gen-eration presumed a normative, rational process, in which the vagariesof human cognition \u2013 such as mindsets, biases, and shortcuts \u2013 wereto be eliminated.\n24In that sense, traditional analytic tradecraft (over-\nstating to make the point) tried to turn people into machines ratherthan dividing the labor into what people and what machines do best.The premise here is that tacit knowledge is badly undervalued andwarrants recognition, even pursuit.\nThus, reshaping best practice to incorporate tacit knowledge will\nrequire dramatically rethinking the analytic process, at least for issuesthat require deep understanding, in which the expert is more impor-\ntant than the expertise, as re\ufb02ected in a piece of written analysis. By\nde\ufb01nition (if it exists), tacit knowledge, like judgment, is the domainof the expert deeply steeped in the subject matter. Thus, organizationswould bene\ufb01t from devising a means by which senior analysts coaxtheir preconscious tacit knowledge into awareness and expression, toproduce \ufb01nished intelligence as well as to enhance the competence ofjunior analysts.\nTapping into tacit knowledge also will require further muting dis-\ntinctions, especially between collector and analyst. During the ColdWar, that distinction may have made sense, but it does so no longer.NSA translators, collectors who had listened to conversations of for-eign leaders at all times of the night and day, were valuable sources ofadvice about those talkative subjects. They could offer analytic judg-ments and rich syntheses of volumes of collection over long periods toanyone who thought to ask, but they were almost never consulted forthose judgments. They were not analysts. In contrast, today analystsact as collectors. They debrief, search and browse, and go to publicforums to observe their principals or targets. The best collectors surf-ing the Web are analysts, who know what they are looking for and candistinguish wheat from chaff. The line between collector and analystis already blurred in practice.\nSimilarly, closer connections between the CIA\u2019s analysts and its\nspymasters are good for both: analysts can help spymasters avoidpassing along explicit knowledge in spy reports that is true but notnew, and analysts can bene\ufb01t from the practical knowledge of theiroperations colleagues on the streets of foreign lands (which is why\n152 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nanalysts often highly value the personal \u201cthink pieces\u201d that stationchiefs sometimes forward).\n25\nAccess to Information\nOpening access to information is one of the most dif\ufb01cult challengesintelligence organizations face \u2013 and it is a major subject of Chap-ter 7. In the wake of September 11, it was driven by the need toreach out to state and local authorities and was labeled information-\nsharing . In fact, the challenge is about how intelligence does its busi-\nness because innovations in intelligence analysis run directly into\nexisting security procedures, which are designed to limit informationto those with a need to know it, not share it. Yet, new analytic insightsare likely to arise precisely from those who come to information witha fresh perspective, who may have noneed to know. On these matters,\nmore discussion will come later.\nDesirable Redundancy\nPrivate companies value redundancy, even competition, among unitsas a way to avoid the perils of groupthink.\n26Intelligence\u2019s analytic\ncommunity has considerable redundancy \u2013 Congress is forever chid-ing it over the waste \u2013 but little management of that redundancy. Mostof the redundancy results from separate agencies tailoring similar ana-lytic products to the needs of disparate consumers \u2013 for instance, StateDepartment analysts write for their policy counterparts, while DIAof\ufb01cers tailor their products to the needs of senior Pentagon of\ufb01cials.Because analysts are relatively inexpensive by comparison to collec-tion, that tailoring makes sense. Beyond that, multiple perspectivescan be valuable; however, because redundancy is not managed sys-tematically across the community, it is not part of a deliberate schemefor achieving quality or accuracy \u2013 which is indicative of another chal-lenge for the DNI.\nRedundancy becomes unhelpful in two circumstances (expanded\non in Chapter 7) but could be helpful under one condition. If mul-tiple views seem pure cacophony, policy of\ufb01cials will rightly say theprocess is not producing useful intelligence at all. If there are sev-eral views \u2013 and if customers have little basis for judging their relative\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 153\nquality \u2013 then policy makers will \u201ccherry-pick,\u201d naturally opting forthe interpretation that is most congenial given their current agenda,bias, or policy favorite. Without common quality standards and a sys-tem that ensures comparable rigor, multiple analytic teams can cometo different conclusions with different degrees of validity and objec-tivity. Ideally, quality \u2013 the most rigorous, objective, and cogent pro-duct \u2013 should dominate, but cherry-picking allows policy makers tochoose the one that serves political purpose without regard necessar-ily for quality.\nCompeting analysis \u2013 a traditional, directed approach mandated in\nExecutive Order 12333 and encompassed in what is now called alter-\nnative analysis \u2013 is a type of redundancy with a long tradition.\n27An\nunderlying assumption in competitive analysis is that a common stan-dard applies to all comers; the system applies equally an articulatedquality-assurance process and criteria to sources, data, and tradecraft.However, experience \u2013 revealed in disseminated products and publicdiscussion of how they were crafted, as well as in postmortems fromboth internal and external reviews \u2013 has shown that the common stan-dard is applied inconsistently at best, if it exists at all.\nSimultaneity\nAs Table 6.1 suggests, when the primary task of intelligence was thepuzzle of Soviet capabilities, a linear, serial process made sense. Forinstance, one analyst or team might seek to understand Soviet subma-rine propellers and then see their work integrated with other piecesto judge the capabilities of the submarine overall. Now, however, theless bounded nature of the target means that analysts on many issuesneed to work in teams, sometimes extremely diverse, with the var-ious components of the team\u2019s work brought together not each inturn but rather in parallel and continuously. This is part of the rea-soning behind analytic centers, which combine multiple disciplinesunder a common management. They are based on the model of matrixproject teams that arose in the defense industry to deal with com-plex, multifaceted design, engineering, and manufacturing. Not onlyis the product cycle for intelligence faster now, but for some issuesthe product itself also is changing, which is discussed later in regard tosensemaking.\n154 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nSystems for Learning\nLesson-learning is a parlous art in government, not just intelligence, assuggested previously in this chapter. Postmortems in the intelligencebusiness are usually conducted in the full glare of publicity and there-fore tend more toward assessing blame than learning how to do better.When run internally, they are often matters for the IG (perceived oractual matters of wrongdoing) or management accountability \u2013 in anycase, the postmortems are conducted under the banners of account-ability and blame. This contrasts with the military\u2019s long-time prac-tice of conducting after-action reviews (AARs) following operationsas a matter of course. The cultural expectation in military units thatexamining what went right and wrong after signi\ufb01cant operations ren-ders this re\ufb02ection routine, providing an opportunity to do so out ofthe limelight. The WMD Commission recommended a special lesson-learning unit, which the DNI moved to establish for the intelligencecommunity. This could lead to a new view of lessons learned, as out-lined previously \u2013 not a series of cases or postmortems either of fail-ures or successes but rather a process of continuous improvement anda codi\ufb01ed set of lessons indeed learned.\napplying best practices to analysis\nSuppose the application of best practices in analysis started not withanalysts but rather with consumers. What do consumers want andneed? It would be possible to identify scores of different consumerneeds, but a compromise between reality and manageability mightproduce eight or ten. Moving down the list corresponds \u2013 but onlyroughly \u2013 to the shift from puzzles, to mysteries, to complexities.\nTable 6.2 summarizes these types of needs, issues, and likely de-\nmands from and on policy of\ufb01cials.\nThe last \ufb01ve columns of Table 6.2 suggest analytic best practice for\neach: Does it require analysis or is it primarily reporting? Is it drivenby collection or by problem? Does it require specialists or generalistanalysts? Can it be accomplished by individual analysts or small teamswithout much formal methodology, or does it require larger teamsand more by way of machine and method? Must it be done inside orcan it be outsourced? To be sure, the more fragmented the process\nTable 6.2.

This is not necessarily an argument againstoutsourcing, but it does stress the importance of the fusion function.\nConsider each of the following categories of consumer needs:\nrEasily validated tactical information. This information consists ofthe solutions to tactical puzzles, solutions that will immediately beproven right or wrong, such as the locations of an enemy facil-ity or tank column. Many but not all of the solutions require lit-tle or no processing; the processing protocols can be developedin advance. An example is generating targets for weapons, whatthe Pentagon calls designated mean points of impact (DMPIs, pro-nounced \u201cdimpies\u201d). Such targeting intelligence in wartime will bedriven by collection, although the speci\ufb01c collection should also bedriven by the needs of targeting. The work is more reporting thananalysis, but it is reporting of a speci\ufb01c type. The human needs fallcloser to the generalist end of the generalist\u2013deep-specialist spec-trum, although considerable understanding of the collection sys-tems is required. They will be teams and require technologies, againof a specialized type. Theirs is work for insiders, although contrac-tors could assist with technology.\nrWarning, generally of military moves or threats, that is not easily val-idated but does rely on predeveloped indicators. When the numberof those \ufb02ashing indicator lights increases, the warning level esca-lates. Analysis is necessary \ufb01rst in developing the indicators andthen in providing context for the change in blinking lights. This isalso collection-driven. Although it is primarily reporting, it doesrequire analysts to provide context for the change in blinking lights(indicators). It requires primarily generalist analysts, who can workalone or in small groups, without much method more than the col-lection and warning system; it too is a job for insiders.\nrWarning, perhaps more of a political and economic character, forwhich the indicators are less precise . Examples include coups or\nchanges of government or failed states, the indicators of which areless clear than troops out of garrison, but there is a shape to thewarning problem and some history of where to look for indicators.The propensity toward a certain outcome can be identi\ufb01ed, but spe-ci\ufb01c triggers that will produce that outcome are more dif\ufb01cult toforesee. This type of warning is more driven by issue or problem\n158 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthan collection, although collection may provide particular insights.The task is more analysis than reporting, and there is a higher pre-mium on substantive expertise. Individual experts can work with-out formal methods, although there is value in bringing nonexpertsinto the team. Fairly sophisticated methods, such as FACTIONS,may advance the messier and more political challenges. Indeed,one intelligence project of the 1960s, Project Camelot, aimed tobuild a general social-systems model to predict signi\ufb01cant politicalevents, such as coups in Latin America. Alas, it ended by poison-ing relations with those social scientists when CIA funding wasrevealed. Still, for this need, insiders have an advantage over out-siders only to the extent that secret sources provide special pur-chase on the issue.\nrImmediate tactical support to nonmilitary consumers. This is mostlypuzzle-solving, perhaps through stealing the other side\u2019s negotiat-ing plan or discovering critical information about secretive foreignleaders with whom U.S. policy makers are about to meet. It mightrange from primarily reporting, in the case of negotiating plans, tomore analysis, in the instance of the leadership and psychologicalanalyses that are a popular stock-in-trade of the CIA\u2019s DI. Thisis reporting, perhaps with some commentary, although it shadesinto analysis with, for example, leadership pro\ufb01les. It can be bothcollection-driven, in the case of particular secret-source insights,and more issue-driven, in the case of impending visits by foreign-ers or ongoing negotiations, for example. It is done by generalists,shading into country specialists in the case of leadership. It can bedone by individual analysts or small teams without much recourseto technology or method. It is the province of insiders, given thatusually the government would not like it known that it has thesource or is conducting the analysis.\nrRecognizing patterns. This is mostly puzzle-solving. It ranges fromassembling the enemy\u2019s order of battle from a variety of sources, torapidly iterating to \ufb01eld commanders information of tactical value,to assembling information \u2013 and perhaps using machines to see orresurrect patterns \u2013 to con\ufb01rm patterns or detect anomalies, such asthe infamous \ufb02ying lessons taken by the 9/11 hijackers. It is drivenby problems, although sources will matter. It mostly requires gen-eralists, and some of it can be done by individual analysts, but it willbe aided by technology and often by teams of diverse backgrounds\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 159\nand approaches. Given classi\ufb01cation, it is probably mostly a taskfor insiders.\nrIdentifying or categorizing emerging issues. This is a different typeof warning, more mystery-shaping than puzzle-solving. Is a near-visible issue or a change in a particular political constellation a bigdeal or a small one? Is it an apple or an orange? The challenge hereis that policy makers may be interested in this open-ended infor-mation only brie\ufb02y and at a stage in which intelligence does nothave much to report. This mystery-shaping analysis is also drivenby issues and problems. It can be done by individual analysts, with-out much methodology; however, those analysts need to be spe-cialists. Intelligence insiders have an advantage, again, only to theextent that secret sources provide purchase on the issues (which isnot likely, given that not much collection attention will have beengiven to the issue yet).\nrAssessing the implications of policy choices. Intelligence is notasked to do this enough and seldom knows enough about the alter-natives at play to do so on its own. Moreover, this is mystery-framing because the choices have not yet been made. Becausefew policy makers, at this point in the process, are disinterestedchoosers, many would seek this intelligence only if they were con\ufb01-dent that it would support a preferred choice, which is similar tothe previous category. The main difference is that insiders havean additional advantage to the extent that they may know morethan outsiders about the immediate agenda for government deci-sion. Whether teams and methods are necessary will depend on thenature of the issue.\nrFraming the future. This might be thought of as a variant of theprevious category, but one that involves scenarios, what-ifs, red-teaming, and other forms of alternative analysis.\n28Again, the pol-\nicy market for it is likely to be thin but may be present if the issueis dif\ufb01cult enough and not settled solely by ideological preconcep-tions. What to do about North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is an exam-ple: there are no good answers and reality confounds preconcep-tions (e.g., \u201cDon\u2019t negotiate with tyrants\u201d). The difference betweenthis and the previous category is that secrets will matter much lesshere; therefore, outsiders are not handicapped and may even beadvantaged to the extent they have fresh or different views. Also,teams and methods will be imperative.\n160 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nrSensemaking about the future . This is similar to the previous cat-\negory but for complexities rather than mysteries. The methodol-ogy for sensemaking \u2013 creating a uni\ufb01ed, explanatory, consensualunderstanding about the world that leads to principled, consistentaction \u2013 requires forms of analysis and interactions with consumersthat are not yet developed, well known, or widely used. It is explicitabout what is implicit in most of the other analytic needs and,because it requires common understanding, it probably requiresmore interactive intelligence process than products. After all, thereal need is not good analysis on a piece of paper (too often inintelligence, these paper goods are treated as ends in themselves);rather, the need is for improved understanding by of\ufb01cials whowill decide or act. It is more dif\ufb01cult to draw the implications forthis task because it is not yet fully developed or implemented; itremains largely a theoretical construct. Teams, methods, and bothgeneralist and specialist analysts will play essential roles. Because acommon understanding of the world is at the core of sensemaking,being close to and interacting with consumers will be imperative;thus, insiders have the advantage on that score.\nrExpert views of deep mysteries and complexities. These are ques-tions without answers: \u201cWhere is China headed?\u201d \u201cDo events inLatin America herald a broad backlash against globalization?\u201dHere, the challenge for intelligence is proving it has value, for evenprescient insights may not appear to help policy makers with thepress of immediate decisions. This is more traditional deep under-standing, driven by issues and accomplished by experts, functionalor regional. They may be helped by formal methods, but usuallythe separate views of individual experts are more useful than teamconclusions, which might homogenize or suppress the individualinsights that add value. Insiders have no advantage; it all dependson the expertise.In developing best practices based on these guidelines, experi-\nments or pilot projects can be extremely useful. For instance, virtuallyall of the 2000 postmortems called for more creativity in analysis \u2013a steep hill to climb. Yet, psychologists are eloquent about busy,harried people being less likely to be creative.\n29Rather, creativity\narises from re\ufb02ection, from down time. An experiment might create a\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 161\ncell for understanding, for example, Al Qaeda and its strategy. Thatcell might be enjoined from current production but instead empow-ered to re\ufb02ect, to attend conferences, to walk in the park, to consultoutsiders, to brainstorm \u2013 passing insights only when it had them. Awell-designed experiment could be used to quantitatively measure anyimprovement in problem-solving performance as compared to a stan-dard analysis cell. Unfortunately, to describe such an experiment is todisplay why it is more likely to win a congressional \u201cwaste in govern-ment\u201d award than actually to occur.\nExperiments with different forms of teaming would also be a natu-\nral. Some research and experiments are beginning to be undertaken \u2013for instance, by the CIA\u2019s DI. For all the concern about groupthink,teams perform many tasks better than individuals working alone.Sometimes, the sheer complexity of the problem demands more headsthan one to account for the range of expertise needed. For example,the terrorist target seems to require teams of people who can thinkabout religion, region, strategy, business, leadership, and \u2013 as men-tioned previously \u2013 our own assets and vulnerabilities. What kind ofteams would be optimal? Experiments might form different kinds ofteams \u2013 those that mixed ages, professional specialties, and \u2013 givenadvances in cognitive testing \u2013 different mental capabilities and styles.Again, the various agency practices would constitute natural environ-ments for experiments. The experiments could also help answer thequestions of what kinds of teams, for what kinds of tasks, and underwhat circumstances.\nThe aim of the experiments and pilot projects would be to take\nanalysis beyond alternative analysis. While traditional intelligenceanalysis generates forecasts or explanations based on logical pro-cessing of available evidence, alternative analysis seeks to help ana-lysts and policy makers stretch their thinking through structured tech-niques that challenge ongoing assumptions and broaden the range ofpossible outcomes considered. The 2004 Act made a gesture of sup-port toward analysis by requiring alternative analysis (de\ufb01ned some-what oddly as red-teaming, but practice could include many more\nvarieties of methods) and mandating the DNI to appoint a watchdogfor integrity and objectivity in the analytic process.\n30\nAlternative analysis serves as a hedge against the natural tenden-\ncies of analysts \u2013 like all human beings \u2013 to perceive information\n162 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nselectively through the lens of preconceptions; to see the world as anextension of themselves (i.e., mirror imaging and ethnocentrism); tosearch too narrowly for facts that would con\ufb01rm rather than discreditexisting hypotheses \u2013 the bias that Rob Johnston\u2019s study found so per-vasive in the analytic culture; and to be unduly in\ufb02uenced by prema-ture consensus within analytic groups close at hand.\n31In theory, use\nof alternative analysis techniques can help to reduce the likelihoodof failure. The text box on page 164 illustrates a range of alternativeanalysis techniques.\nYet, in the end, the division between traditional or conventional\nanalysis and alternative analysis is itself the heart of the problemof uneven application. There is no alternative analysis, only anal-ysis. Within that realm are nested a variety of techniques, whichcan be prescribed as better or avoided as worse under speci\ufb01ableconditions (e.g., types of problems or questions, cycle time for pro-duction, types and parameters of data, sophistication and needs ofconsumers). There can be guidelines for how they are used. Becauseorganizations tend to get what they measure, management systemswould have to give less attention to counting things (e.g., papers pro-duced per analyst per unit and numbers of tools used per unit of time)and more attention to assessing the quality of analysis or incremen-\ntal value added, which would relate to applying a variety of analytictechniques as a type of triangulation on certain problems. This wouldmove away from box-checking to meeting criteria for good analysis,within which a number of options would be available.\nMoreover, the demands of future analysis will raise critical issues\nabout the mix and levels of cognitive capabilities that may makefuture analysts different than today\u2019s. Conceivably, some of the ana-lysts will require more cognitive \ufb02exibility and complexity to matchthe higher speed and density of data \ufb02ow, complexity of available ana-lytical tools, and speed with which analysts will able to generate andtest hypotheses with tools; higher visual/spatial reasoning to make useof new visual analytics (e.g., today\u2019s tools include Starlight and IN-SPIRE); and faster cognitive speed to leverage the speed and band-width of technology without suffering attention overload. Socially,not everyone functions equally well with the temporal-spatial distanceand autonomy likely afforded virtual teams and telecommuters. Somepeople need more human contact or imposed structure. All these\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 163\nissues have implications for analyst-selection standards; procedures;and policies, training, and workplace design and ergonomics.\nThere is no shortage of tool-building happening \u2013 for example, at\nthe CIA\u2019s In-Q-Tel and Advanced Technology Programs; the intel-ligence community\u2019s Advanced Research and Development Activityand Intelligence Information Innovation Center; and the Pentagon\u2019sDARPA. The initiatives are focused not only on mining large datasetsbut also on remembering discarded hypotheses and seeing new pat-terns, as well as providing analysts with better ways of workingtogether. As yet, however, the initiatives are scattered and oftendriven by technology. With no clearinghouse for matching what ana-lysts want and what technology can provide, there is the risk that inno-vations will remain just sophisticated terabytes of technology, not realadvances in analytic method.\nTherefore, a DNI should move to create a focal point for tool-\nbuilding and innovation in using the tools. If, for instance, all analystshad more or less similar workstations, it would facilitate movingthem around the intelligence community, including to newly createdcenters. A focal point for learning lessons would make sense forall the reasons discussed previously.\n32The DNI\u2019s effort to create a\nlessons-learned unit \ufb01rst foundered on precisely the common imageof postmortems \u2013 that the unit would grade the copybooks of the ana-lytic agencies. For the CIA, its Center for the Study of Intelligence,which published the Johnston book cited previously, would seem tobe such a focal point, and it was charged with taking that role whenGeneral Michael Hayden became DCI. So far, the Center, whichpublishes a sold journal, Studies in Intelligence, has been mostly a pro-\nducer of internal CIA histories. The Center\u2019s bias is that of historiansand covert operators, both of whom are preoccupied more with theparticularities of cases than with possible lessons for the future.\nengaging consumers\nIn engaging consumers, especially at the sensemaking end of the listof needs, analysis should be perceived as a continuous, integrativeprocess. The deliverable would be process, not product, including arecursive dialogue between analyst and consumer in which toolsengage the consumer to create and test hypotheses (to \u201cwhat if?\u201d)\n164 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ndirectly with the data as part of the process. In much of the currentpractice of analysis, most of the time is spent on writing, editing, andcoordinating, not on thinking or sensemaking. Thinking of analysis asa process, not a product, and construing the engagement with sourcesand consumers as integral might help rebalance the investment of timeand commensurately improve the analysis.\nSelected Alternative Analysis Techniques\nContrarian\nrDevil\u2019s Advocacy analysis in which an analyst is assigned to use\navailable evidence to develop an argument contrary to the pre-vailing analytic line.\nrA Team/B Team analysis in which naturally arising differences\namong analysts are brought to the fore (rather than suppressedas in groupthink) by dividing them into teams tasked with pro-ducing con\ufb02icting interpretations of evidence.\nrRed Team analysis in which analysts try to think or act like an\nadversary in order to test prevailing assumptions about Red\u2019sintentions or behavior.\nContingent\nrWhat-If? analysis in which an analyst varies a key assumption\nand speculates how this might lead to different behavior by anactor. In a variant:\nrLow Probability/High Impact analysis, the same operation is\nconducted but with the aim of testing an unlikely but plausibleoutcome with dramatic consequences (e.g., \u201cWhat if poor butaggressive Ruritania obtains the bomb?\u201d).\nrAlternative Scenarios (called scenario planning in the business\ncommunity) involve a more complex effort to conceive two ormore plausible alternative outcomes by identifying and thenexploring the interaction of underlying drivers of behavior andsituational triggers and enablers. The outcomes are transformedinto stories \u2013 hence, the term scenarios \u2013 to allow policy makers\nto more deeply understand the path to, nature of, and implica-tions of the alternative outcomes.\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 165\nAn important step in this direction has already been mentioned:\nsensemaking, as developed particularly by the noted organization the-orist Karl Weick. It is a process through which organizations, not indi-viduals, comprehend the complex environment with which they con-tend.\n33Sensemaking is a continuous, iterative, largely intuitive effort\nto paint a picture of what is going on in the environment of a target.It is accomplished by comparing new events to past patterns or, in thecase of anomalies, by developing stories to account for them. Sense-making, in fact, is conducted every day in current intelligence, whichis a continuous, largely informal effort to update the storyline on anissue. It also underlies the key warning concept of recognition or dis-covery of patterns of behavior.\nA compelling example at the tactical end of analysis is called multi-\nINT. The key is rapid iteration of information from more than onesensor. In one sense, multi-INT is not conceptually different fromwhat intelligence calls fusion or even all-source analysis . However, in\nAfghanistan and Iraq, it has involved analysts from the NSA (han-dling SIGINT) and the NGA (handling IMINT) in networks to per-mit rapid responses in support of operational decisions made underintense time pressure.\nIn principle, however, multi-INT could be accomplished within a\nsingle INT or even a single organization. In the incident during thesummer of 2001, for instance, the Phoenix FBI agents who were inter-ested in Zacarias Moussauoi\u2019s \ufb02ying school did not know that theircolleagues had been interested in the same school two years earlier onsuspicion that Osama bin Laden\u2019s pilot had trained there. The FBI didnot know what it knew. It tripped on an \u201cunknown known,\u201d to extendRumsfeld\u2019s terms. In this case, what was required was not rapidly lay-ing information from several INTs on top of each other but, rather,ways of assuring that what was known did not become unknown \u2013that previous interests in particular behaviors did not vanish if theyhad not been pursued to fruition before.\nMore generally, the aim of sensemaking would not be to examine\nrigorously alternative assumptions or outcomes but rather to promptanalysts to be continually alert to different types of patterns. To bor-row another concept used by organizational decision-making experts,it would aim to promote mindfulness within the analytic intelligenceorganization.\n34According to organizational literature by proponents,\n166 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nmindfulness \u2013 an intellectual orientation favoring continuous evalua-\ntion of expectations and assumptions \u2013 is found in many organizationsthat successfully deal with high levels of complexity and uncertainty,such as aircraft carriers and nuclear power plants.\nSuch organizations accomplish effective sensemaking of their envi-\nronments, as indicated by exceptionally low rates of accidents (aminor equivalent of an intelligence failure). According to Weick\u2019s the-ory and some associated research, high levels of mindfulness are asso-ciated with, among other things, a preoccupation with past and poten-tial failure and a learning culture in which it is safe and even valuedfor members of the organization to admit error and raise doubts.\nIn shaping those processes, the watchwords are as follows\n35:\nrSocial : People do not discover sense, they create it, usually in con-\nversations. Those conversations are critical.\nrIdentity : The \ufb01rst identities that surface in an inexplicable event,\nidentities such as \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201c\ufb01ghter,\u201d lock people in to overlylimited options. Moving beyond \ufb01rst identities is imperative.\nrRetrospect : Faced with the inexplicable, people often act their way\nout of their puzzlement by talking and looking at what they havesaid in order to discover what they may be thinking. The need is tomake it possible for people to talk their way from the super\ufb01cial,through the complex, to the profound.\nrCues : People deal with the inexplicable by paying attention to a\nfew cues that enable them to construct a larger story. They lookfor cues that con\ufb01rm their analysis, and, in doing so, they ignore agreat deal. Expanding the range and variety of cues is important.\nrOngoing: Sensemaking is dynamic and requires continuous updat-ing and reaccomplishment. Groups cannot languish in thinking,\u201cNow we have it \ufb01gured out.\u201d\nrPlausibility: What is unsettling when people face the inexplicable isthat they tend to treat any explanation as better than nothing. Thatis healthy, but the \ufb01rst plausible account cannot be the last possiblestory.\nrEnactment : Most of all, in inexplicable times, people must keep\nmoving. Recovery lies not in thinking and then doing but ratherin thinking while doing and in thinking bydoing. People need to\nkeep moving and paying attention.\nThe Special Challenge of Analysis 167\nThe watchwords are fairly abstract, but they suggest the goals in\nboth designing organizations and especially fashioning processes with-in and across them. Suppose, for instance, the FBI and the CIA of\ufb01-cers who met in New York in June 2001 had engaged in a sensemakingconversation instead of mutually holding back information they werenot sure they could pass to one another. They might have led to thejoint discovery of where two of the September 11 terrorists had beenand, in fact, were. Broadened, it might have introduced \ufb02ight schoolsas a jolt, which might then have triggered another round of conversa-tion in an effort to make sense of that inexplicable piece.\nMindfulness is critical not only in the sense of being open-minded\nbut also in the sense of being aware of just how uncertain the complex-ity of reality can be and how possible it is that the group will be sur-prised. Sustaining mindfulness among time-pressed consumers wouldbe even more dif\ufb01cult than getting them to read alternative-analysispapers on occasion. Again, a portfolio of research and experimentwould make sense; several have already been mentioned. RapiSims\nis one way to let consumers work through the various implications ofdifferent intelligence conclusions and to do all of it at their desk.\n36\nRobust decision making, similar in spirit, uses the power of comput-ers to let analysts (and decision makers) alter variables, looking forassessments (or policies) that are robust across a wide range, perhapshundreds, of scenarios.\nIf being too close to consumers breeds bias but being too far away\nleads to irrelevance, why not test this proposition with experiments,giving analysts different degrees of proximity to policy and the policyagenda? Indeed, this might not be conducted through experiment butrather through mining the experiences of the many intelligence ana-lysts who have served rotations in policy positions. In the end, analyticpractice will not be reshaped until the product of analysis is recon-\nceived \u2013 not as words or bytes in a \ufb01nished document but as betterunderstanding in the mind of policy makers.\n7\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets\nThe speci\ufb01c concern in the infamous debate over the Iraqi \u201cWMDthat weren\u2019t\u201d was politicization \u2013 the risk that intelligence would be\nunder pressure, usually more implicit than explicit, to produce assess-ments that suited the preferences of national administrations. Yet, toooften in my experience, politicization was avoided at the cost of irrel-evance \u2013 those interesting but not useful analyses that answered ques-tions no one was asking. Analysts in the intelligence \u201ctribe\u201d couldavoid politicization from their counterparts in the policy tribe byremaining aloof from them.\nThinking about the future of analysis requires considering from\nwhence the pressures toward politicization will arise and perhapsrethinking the ways to protect against it without condemning analysisto irrelevance. In that future, the principal danger may be more subtlethan overt politicization. It may be the temptation \u2013 seen in what hasbecome the almost regular declassifying of NIEs \u2013 of administrationsand their leaders to use intelligence to justify their policies, which putsintelligence in an unwanted and exposed public position.\nThe federal agencies call reaching out to the vastly expanded tribe\nof consumers \u2013 those 700,000 law enforcement of\ufb01cers in eighteenthousand government jurisdictions, plus the private-sector managersof \u201cpublic\u201d infrastructure \u2013 information-sharing . That is precisely\nwhat it is not. First, the language implies that agencies own theirinformation, sharing it only as they see \ufb01t; in that sense, the languageonly reinforces the existing stovepipes. Second, the language of shar-ing implies that if information could only move more freely, presto!,all would be well.\n1Third, it implies that the challenge of sharing\n168\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 169\nintelligence with state and local authorities, down to the cop on thebeat, is technical \u2013 enough information pipes to move informationfreely. It is not. Technology can help, but the challenge is one of pol-icy, not hardware.\nFourth, and perhaps worst, the language implies that the sharing\ngoes in one direction, with the federal agencies as providers and theother as grateful recipients, and that what gets shared downward isinformation. Yet, the new consumers are producers as well; the \ufb02owneeds to be both information and analysis, and it needs to move inboth directions. In fact, the heart of the issue is how intelligence doesits business. Existing business practices, with each intelligence agencycontrolling the information it produces, make it dif\ufb01cult enough toshare across U.S. intelligence, let alone get information to state andlocal authorities.\nThe core of the policy problem begins with intelligence \u2013 with exist-\ning security procedures that are designed to limit information to thosewith a \u201cneed to know,\u201d not share it. Yet, fresh analytic insights, forexample, are likely to arise precisely from those who come to theinformation with a fresh perspective, who have noneed to know. The\nfundamental challenge is reshaping how the U.S. government thinksof information as well as how information should be produced, used,and controlled.\nintelligence and policy tribes\nThe mushrooming of consumers compounds the challenge of commu-nication between intelligence and its consumers, which was dif\ufb01cultenough at the federal level before September 11. Table 7.1 illustratessome of the contrasts between the federal tribes of intelligence andpolicy.\nWashington policy of\ufb01cials live and die in policy contests at home,\nwhich is where their stakes lie and their attentions follow. By con-trast, the main intelligence agencies, from the CIA to the INR to theDIA, were all oriented toward foreign countries; that preoccupationderived from mission but also, in many cases, was reinforced by law.The agencies were enjoined from operating at home: recall the dis-tinctions of the Cold War intelligence legacy. Thus, intelligence of\ufb01-cials often understood Moscow better than Washington, Botswana\n170 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 7.1.

That has changed over time, andthe change has been sharper since September 11, but intelligence of\ufb01-cers often are still uncomfortable thinking, let alone writing, too muchabout what is happening at home. At the NIC, I would gently suggestto my colleagues that while understanding foreign places was intelli-gence\u2019s stock-in-trade and should remain so, the effort of spending afew minutes thinking about \u2013 perhaps even inquiring into \u2013 the policyof\ufb01cials they were trying to help would be richly repaid.\nIntelligence analysts are re\ufb02ective by nature; they want to under-\nstand. That has not changed much because of September 11 becausethose who are drawn into intelligence analysis \u2013 even analysis ofdomestic intelligence \u2013 have alternatives. As one analyst told me yearsago, \u201cIf I had wanted to sell shoes, I would have gone into that line\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 171\nof work.\u201d Thus, expecting many analysts to be entrepreneurial, toreach out with their stories, is expecting too much. Policy of\ufb01cials, bycontrast, tend to be active; they want to do, not just think. They cameto Washington to signify; they want to make a difference.\nThe contrasts between the tribes run to time horizon and operating\nstyle as well. If policy of\ufb01cers are to signify, they have to do so quickly;the average tenure of an assistant secretary is not much more thana year. Moreover, most of those of\ufb01cials \u2013 Congress is a provocativeexception \u2013 are driven by their in-boxes, which are now electronic, notphysical. They may have some idea of what they want to accomplish inthe next few months but they usually have little idea of what they willbe working on next Tuesday. Thus, when they want something, theywant it yesterday. For intelligence, the result is the classic process of\u201churry up and wait\u201d; instant deadlines arise instantly and then disap-pear just as quickly if policy is distracted by another immediate crisis.\nFrom the perspective of intelligence, those congressional con-\nsumers \u2013 members and staffers alike \u2013 are interestingly but danger-ously different. Although members are harried by the incessant roundof committee meetings and traveling to their home districts, they \u2013 andeven more so their staffers \u2013 are less driven by those electrons in theirin-boxes, which is especially the case when Congress is not in session.Congressional consumers are thus interesting to intelligence because,for them, more information is not always a bother as it almost alwaysis for executive branch of\ufb01cials. They are on the alert for ways to makea difference, and information can be useful. Yet, for precisely that rea-son, they are dangerous for intelligence. They are hardly disinterestedconsumers; rather, they want to useinformation. In America\u2019s divided\ngovernment, they often use it against intelligence\u2019s ostensible mastersin the administration in power.\nNot only is the perspective of intelligence analysts longer in time\nthan executive branch of\ufb01cials, their intelligence products also bene\ufb01tfrom additional time. More time almost always permits collecting newinformation or re\ufb01ning the analysis, as well as coordinating with otheragencies to seek agreement or sharpen differences. Part of the failingin the October 2002 estimate on Iraqi WMD was simple shoddiness.Doing an estimate in several months does not seem challenging fromthe outside, but it is from the inside when representatives from a do-zen or more agencies argue about every shade of nuance in every line.\n172 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nIntelligence of\ufb01cers are in a service industry; they work for the gov-\nernment, not administrations or individuals. Thus, they try hard notonly to avoid partisanship but also to keep their ideologies or biasesout of their work. To be fair, because they are human, they do notalways succeed, but still they \ufb01nd it surprising when policy of\ufb01cialsassume that anything they receive from anywhere, including intelli-gence, is an argument for or against a policy position. Those policyof\ufb01cials live in a world of advocacy, not analysis. In classes I teachfor intelligence professionals, I tell outside presenters that, of course,they cannot check their policy views at the door, like guns in Old Westsaloons. However, the intelligence participants will be discomfortedby explicit discussions of particular policy issues, such as whether theIraq war was wise or foolish. For them, intelligence is an input, not anargument.\nPreoccupied with the world \u201cover there,\u201d intelligence seeks to\nunderstand and display the complexity of that foreign reality. In theprocess, it is more likely to exaggerate that complexity than to under-state it. There is always one more factor to consider. By contrast,policy of\ufb01cials, impelled to act, are prone to simplify both cause andeffect. They would like theanswer, preferably the answer for which\nthey are looking. They usually are smart enough to know that theyseldom can have theanswer, let alone the one they seek, but their life\nwould be easier if they could.\nFinally, and perhaps most important, the impact of the terrorism\nand other transnational issues is slow to change the orientation ofintelligence toward the world, which is to take it as a given. Intel-ligence of\ufb01cers regard their task as understanding that reality. Formany of them as experts, not only is that reality overdetermined \u2013the product of a long list of factors \u2013 it is also likely to be resistant tochange. Given this orientation, not only is intelligence hard-pressedto imagine discontinuities, it also is skeptical of opportunities for U.S.action to make much difference. If intelligence is likely to understatehow much U.S. action can affect the world, policy of\ufb01cials are likely toexaggerate it. Where intelligence sees \ufb01xity, policy sees malleability.\nTransnational targets such as terrorism of necessity are changing\nthat orientation of intelligence \u2013 a change emphasized in this book.Intelligence is becoming net assessment, where even the capabilities\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 173\nof terrorist groups cannot be understood apart from knowing aboutU.S. defenses and vulnerabilities. However, the change is doublydif\ufb01cult for intelligence. First, it runs against that basic orientationthat the world is a given, to be understood. Second, it raises the dis-comfort of blurring the line between \u201cover there\u201d and \u201chere\u201d for pro-fessionals, most of whom thought their analyses and their jobs stoppedat the water\u2019s edge coming from abroad. It means that spending timethinking about what is happening with \u201cus\u201d is imperative, not just aluxury that might enable analysts to better target their products.\nThe tribal markings of intelligence and policy are not indelible,\nalthough many are deeply rooted in personalities and the careerchoices they drive. People move back and forth across the tribalboundaries, and they take some knowledge of tribal customs withthem. NIOs who were career intelligence professionals did better asNIOs, in my experience, if they had served a stint in a policy jobbecause, as a result, they had a richer understanding of the pace, ori-entation, and needs of the people they were trying to help as NIOs.Yet, the extent of the difference between the tribes is still striking.I wondered not that intelligence and policy sometimes miscommuni-cated but rather that they ever communicated at all.\nparsing politicization: the wmd that weren\u2019t\nIt is in this context that politicization arises. The starting point is toparse what politicization can mean. John Gannon, a former deputy\ndirector for intelligence at the CIA and former chair of the NIC,de\ufb01nes it as \u201cthe willful distortion of analysis to satisfy the demandsof intelligence bosses or policy makers.\u201d\n2I would broaden that de\ufb01ni-\ntion to \u201ccommitments to perspectives or conclusions, in the process ofintelligence analysis or interaction with policy, that suppress other evi-dence or views or blind people to them.\u201d Seen that way, politicizationcan have at least \ufb01ve different, if overlapping, meanings, and severalforms can be at work at once, as follows:\nrDirect pressure from senior policy of\ufb01cials to come to particular\nintelligence conclusions, usually those that accord with those of\ufb01-cials\u2019 policies or policy preferences.\n174 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nr\u201cCherry-picking \u201d (and sometimes growing cherries), in which\nsenior of\ufb01cials, usually policy of\ufb01cials, choose their favorites froma range of assessments.\nrQuestion-asking, in which \u2013 as in other areas of inquiry \u2013 the natureof the question takes the analysis a good way if not to the answerthen at least to the frame in which the answer will lie. A related ver-sion of this form occurs when policy asks a reasonable question butcontinues to ask it repeatedly, which deforms analysis by deprivingit of time and effort to work on other questions \u2013 even if it does notdirectly politicize it.\nrA\u201chouse line\u201d on a particular subject, which shifts the focus of the\nbias from policy to intelligence. Here, a particular analytic of\ufb01cehas a de\ufb01ned view of an issue, and analysts or analyses that suggestheresy are suppressed or ignored.\nrAshared mindset, perhaps one running across intelligence and pol-\nicy. This is perhaps the limiting case; if it is politicization, it is moreself-imposed than policy maker\u2013imposed.Table 7.2 lists these forms of politicization and suggests ways to\nmitigate them.\nThe saga of WMD before the Iraq war demonstrated elements of\nall \ufb01ve forms of politicization, although the limiting case \u2013 mindset \u2013was by far both the most important and the most dif\ufb01cult. Fromreports of the WMD Commission and the Senate Select Committeeon Intelligence, the \ufb01rst form \u2013 direct pressure by policy of\ufb01cials \u2013 was\nabsent.\n3It is crude \u2013 hence, rare \u2013 and analysts would hardly yield\nor admit to it in any case.4It is also fair to report, however, that some\nintelligence analysts believed they were under pressure to produce the\u201cright\u201d answer \u2013 that Saddam Hussein had WMD. As in all humaninteractions, the effect is subjective. Policy of\ufb01cials are not likely toorder intelligence to heel. Rather, they often have strong policy pref-erences, which intelligence knows, so the question becomes at whatpoint the growing force of the policy preference amounts to unduepressure on intelligence.\nIn the WMD case, the form of the question did matter because it\nbecame, simply, \u201cDoes Saddam have WMD?\u201d It was as though thelogic train from a single chemical canister to war was visible for allto see: witness Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld\u2019s statement that the\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 175\nTable 7.2.

Intelli-gence analysis broadened the question, but issues of how much threat,to whom, and over what time frame got lost in the \u201cDoes he?\u201d debate.Moreover, intelligence was asked repeatedly about links between Iraqand Al Qaeda. On the whole, it stuck to its analytic guns \u2013 the link wastenuous at best \u2013 but the repeated questions served to both elevate thedebate over the issue and contribute to intelligence\u2019s relative lack ofattention to other questions.\n5Repeated asking of the question seemed\nto imply that there must be something new to the answer. Question-\nasking had a political effect on intelligence. The house views inside\nintelligence also played a role. In this case, the fact that intelligencehad underestimated Saddam\u2019s WMD programs a decade earlier cer-tainly contributed to a readiness to err \u2013 if at all \u2013 in the other directionthis time around.\nThe other two forms of politicization, however, were critical in\nthe WMD case. Cherry-picking is awkward to deal with because\n176 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nhaving more than one set of analytic eyes on particular evidence andlogic usually seems wise, as suggested in Chapter 6. Analysts are inex-pensive in comparison to collection; therefore, multiple if not com-peting perspectives are often valuable. Indeed, what looks to some \u2013congressional overseers, for example \u2013 like duplication of analysis canbe regarded by others as useful tailoring of analysis to the needs ofdifferent consumers, as it usually has been in my experience.\nThe presence of multiple perspectives, however, can turn nega-\ntive if multiple views seem pure cacophony. Then, policy of\ufb01cials willrightly say the process is not producing any useful intelligence. Theother negative is permitting cherry-picking, especially by senior pol-icy of\ufb01cials. If there are several views among intelligence analysts andall seem to have about the same status, then why not choose the oneI like best? Not all views are equal, however, and in the WMD case,the question being asked in some parts of the government \u2013 implicitlyif not explicitly \u2013 was still narrower than \u201cDoes he?\u201d It was, \u201cWhat\u2019sthe best case that he does?\u201d\nWorse, the cherries were not just picked but also grown \u2013 by a spe-\ncial unit in the policy of\ufb01ce of the Secretary of Defense and labeled theOf\ufb01ce of Special Plans. Some of the evidence supporting those cher-ries was rotten, provided by Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi NationalCongress, which had long been discredited in the eyes of the mainlineintelligence agencies.\n6Therefore, it was not a case of multiple sets of\neyes looking at the same facts in different ways. The evidence was alsodifferent or judged differently. There is no evidence that the Pentagonoperation had a direct effect on the October 2002 NIE, but its per-spective became part of broader \u201cintelligence\u201d in the run-up to war,supporting political arguments that the mainline intelligence agenciesdid not.\nIn the end, however, the WMD story was one of a deeply \ufb02awed\nmindset, one that ran widely across intelligence and policy and alsoincluded European intelligence services whose governments wereopposed to war. If most people believe one view, arguing for anotheris dif\ufb01cult. It is not just the analysts\u2019 fault; rather, it is compounded byhaving policy makers who share \u2013 even advocate for \u2013 \ufb02awed analysis.There is little pressure to rethink the issue, and the few dissenters inintelligence are lost in the wilderness.\nThis form may be more groupthink than politicization in the most\ncommon uses of the term. Yet, the process occurs not in a vacuum but\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 177\nrather in the presence of powerful arguments, those rooted in polit-ical agendas or political convenience or both. For the German inva-sion of France in 1940, the mindset was \u201cThey couldn\u2019t attack throughthe Ardennes.\u201d\n7For Pearl Harbor, as for September 11, it was \u201cThey\nwouldn\u2019t dare, and anyhow they couldn\u2019t.\u201d For the 1973 Yom Kippurwar, it was \u201cEgypt wouldn\u2019t start a war it would lose.\u201d\n8For the 1998\nIndian nuclear test, it was \u201cThey\u2019d be stupid to test, despite theircampaign rhetoric.\u201d\n9Lest the shortcoming be thought con\ufb01ned to\ngovernment intelligence, IBM in the 1980s failed to appreciate theimplications of personal computers because it assumed the long-termdominance of mainframe technology \u2013 a type of politicization stem-ming from convenience amid the dominance of IBM in mainframes.\n10\nChallenging mindset takes something new \u2013 new evidence or evi-\ndence of some new argument \u2013 which is precisely what was notavail-\nable in the WMD case. In that sense, the Iraq failure was as mucha collection failure as an analytic failure, which was implicit in theWMD Commission conclusion cited previously. As the Senate post-mortem stated, \u201cDue to competing, collection priorities globallyand regionally: Operations Northern and Southern Watch, and theemphasis on current, rather than strategic or national, intelligence,there was no focused, collaborative collection effort on the IraqiWMD target.\u201d\n11\nFor Dennis Gormley, \u201cIntelligence failure is virtually assured when\na predisposed analytic mindset is combined with predictable overheadcollection systems.\u201d\n12Imagery was predictable, and both it and SIG-\nINT were devoted to protecting U.S. and allied pilots patrolling the\u201cno \ufb02y\u201d zones. Indeed, by some accounts, the concentration on theno \ufb02y zones became a bone of contention between Secretary Rums-feld and the two agency directors, Michael Hayden of the NSA andJames Clapper of the NGA.\n13With no U.S. of\ufb01cial presence in Iraq,\ntraditional espionage, or HUMINT, was limited and catch-can, whichmade British sources valuable and sources from the Iraqi NationalCongress tempting to those with too little experience \u2013 or too muchagenda.\nIn those circumstances, analysts inside and outside government fell\nback on what had been true. To be sure, in a Bayesian sense, each\nday the UN inspectors did not \ufb01nd evidence of WMD should haveshifted the odds a little in the direction of Iraq not having them.\n14(On\nthat score, the Rumsfeld quote about evidence of absence is wrong.)\n178 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nHowever, it did not. Virtually everyone believed that some evidencewould be found \u2013 including intelligence and policy, insiders and out-siders, and Americans (like me) who thought the war a strategic mis-take from the start.\nIn speaking to the WMD Commission, I used the \u201cperfect storm\u201d\nmetaphor to describe the Iraq WMD case. Its report picked up themetaphor but said the Iraq case was not that perfect storm. What theCommission meant was that features of it appeared in other cases aswell; because two of their \ufb01ve cases remain classi\ufb01ed, it is not possibleto know for sure, but it is likely that the Commission was right. Whatthe Iraq case illustrated was a conjunction of pathologies; mindset wasthe most important. Because there was so little new collection, noth-ing challenged that mindset or the inferences from past behavior onwhich it rested. Saddam himself tried to convince us that he had whathe did not have, or perhaps he did not know he did not \u2013 in any case,it was the oddest of disinformation campaigns.\n15\nGiven the storm, and especially the strength of the mindset, it is not\nclear that there was a way to do better. Surely, the infamous October2002 NIE left much to be desired; in particular, it was overly techni-cal, without much \u201cIraq\u201d or political context in it.\n16The Senate Select\nCommittee on Intelligence\u2019s conclusion, quoted previously, was onthe mark: \u201cMost of the major key judgments ...e i t h e r overstated, or\nwere not supported by, the underlying intelligence reporting. A seriesof failures, particularly in analytic tradecraft, led to the mischarac-terization of the intelligence.\u201d\n17At least, the NIC should have com-\nmissioned a devil\u2019s-advocate piece, perhaps ending as a box in theestimate, seeking to make the best case that Saddam did nothave\nongoing WMD programs. Not that the effort would have made theleast difference to the debate or the war outcome because it would nothave. However, it would have offered greater integrity to the processand, therefore, some protection to the NIC and intelligence in doingtheir job.\nSomething that looked like the opposite of politicization occurred\nwith the November 2007 NIE, Iran\u2019s Nuclear Intentions and Capabili-\nties.\n18The \ufb01rst sentence of that estimate was dramatic: \u201cWe judge with\nhigh con\ufb01dence that in fall 2003, Tehran halted its nuclear weaponsprogram.\u201d The NIE seemed to surprise the Bush administration, andit was read by virtually everyone as undercutting the administration\u2019s\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 179\neffort to step up international sanctions against Iran. To those whoknew less about intelligence analysts, it seemed like the intelligencecommunity was looking ahead to the next administration \u2013 or eventaking its revenge on the Bush administration.\nBy all accounts, the NIE was carefully prepared; after the October\n2002 \ufb01asco, sources were scrubbed especially hard. It acknowledged,refreshingly, that the intelligence community had changed its mind:\u201c[Iran] is less determined to develop nuclear weapons than we havebeen judging since 2005.\u201d The reason was rethinking in light of newinformation, especially Iranian nuclear of\ufb01cials who were overheardcomplaining about suspension of the military program and 2005 pho-tographs of the Natanz enrichment plan, which suggested that it wasnot designed for the high level of enrichment required for nuclearweapons.\n19\nYet, what the intelligence community had done was provide a\ngood answer to the less important question. The focus of adminis-tration policy and the sanctions debate was Iran\u2019s so-called civilian-enrichment program, which could take the country to the brink ofnuclear weapons, more than the speci\ufb01c nuclear weapons program.The NIE indicated \u2013 but only in a footnote \u2013 that it was focused on thelatter, not the former, and it asserted \u201cmoderate-to-high con\ufb01dencethat Tehran at a minimum is keeping open the option to developnuclear weapons.\u201d Only in the fourth key judgment did it pick up thecivilian program speci\ufb01cally: \u201cIran\u2019s civilian uranium enrichment pro-gram is continuing. We also assess with high con\ufb01dence that since fall2003, Iran has been conducting research and development projectswith commercial and conventional military applications \u2013 some ofwhich would also be of limited use for nuclear weapons.\u201d\naddressing politicization: types of intelligence\nNone of the forms of politicization is easily addressed; however, sometypes of intelligence seem more prone to politicization than others.Recall the categories of consumer needs for intelligence described inChapter 6. For instance, much of intelligence, especially on the bat-tle\ufb01eld, is puzzle-solving and is explicitly tactical. The location of theenemy tank column either will or will not be where intelligence saysit is; intelligence will be either right or wrong, and in most cases the\n180 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ndifference will be quickly apparent. (That is not to say the tacticalpuzzles will not sometimes be controversial. During the \ufb01rst war inIraq in the 1990s, for instance, the commander, General NormanSchwarzkopf, was critical of CIA bomb-damage assessments. He hadmore con\ufb01dence \u2013 misplaced, it turned out \u2013 in the assessments of thepilots who \ufb02ew the missions.\n20)\nAt the other end of a continuum of intelligence types or needs\nmight be deep experts\u2019 views of mysteries \u2013 however, they are justthat, expert views. Because they are views on mysteries, mattersthat by de\ufb01nition are improvable, they are not likely to be centralenough to policy makers\u2019 decisions to be subject to intense politi-cal pressure. Imagine if some prescient analyst had told the Reaganadministration in the early 1980s that policy should not be worry-ing about the \u201cevil empire\u201d but rather the impending collapse of theSoviet Union! \u201cSensemaking\u201d about complexities \u2013 issues that are\u201cmysteries-plus\u201d in the sense that they do not arise with a history andwith some pre-existing shape \u2013 will be a rapid and iterative exercise, asearch for some sense in a sea of ever-changing complexity. There-fore, sensemaking also does not seem to be a likely candidate forpoliticization.\nRather, it is the needs in the middle of the continuum that seem\nmore problematic. After all, the argument about Iraqi WMD con-cerned a puzzle, not a mystery \u2013 yet, it was a puzzle the solution towhich the administration had hitched its argument for war. I cameaway from my own experience managing NIEs with more sympathyfor the trial by \ufb01re that Robert Gates suffered during his con\ufb01rmationhearings to be DCI in 1991. He was accused, in general, of imposinga hard line on assessments of the Soviet Union and, in particular, ofsetting in motion a paper that sought to make the strongest possiblecase that the Soviet Union had been involved in the attempted assas-sination of Pope John Paul II.\n21Gates was hardly a \u201cshrinking violet,\u201d\nand his views of the Soviet Union were quite different from my own,but his critics seemed to me to have construed hard review of theiranalytic products as pursuing a policy line \u2013 that is, politicization.\nFor the purposes of this discussion, however, the fault lines in\nSoviet analysis that exercised the Gates con\ufb01rmation hearings werenot divisions over puzzles, but neither were they over mysteries. They\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 181\nwere puzzle-like in that they concerned what was, not what might be.They went to the nature of the Soviet Union: how creative it was andwhat was driving its actions in what was then called the Third World.Similarly, when in 1976 as DCI, George H. W. Bush commissionedoutsiders, a \u201cTeam B,\u201d to assess Soviet strategic objectives, missileaccuracy, and air defense in light of of\ufb01cial CIA views, Team A, the\ufb01rst set of issues became a major political controversy.\n22That too was\nnot an argument over a puzzle, but it was an argument over what\nexisted \u2013 Soviet objectives \u2013 not what might be.\nThe issues that are more subject to politicization, not surprisingly,\nare those that have or seem to have obvious policy implications.Stated differently, they seem or can be made to seem to turn policyissues into intelligence issues. For much of recent history, the temp-tation was most visible for Congress. Especially in eras of dividedgovernment, Congress was tempted, for instance, to make sanctionsagainst a particular malefactor nation contingent on intelligence\u2019sconclusions that it had or had not committed some act.\n23To be sure,\nthis process put intelligence in the most awkward of positions, havingbeen given the gun and told to point it at the head of its ostensiblemasters in the executive branch of government.\nYet, the narrowing of the question at issue in the run-up to the Iraq\nwar represented the administration\u2019s success at turning a policy ques-tion \u2013 \u201cShould the United States attack Iraq?\u201d \u2013 into an intelligencequestion: \u201cDoes he or doesn\u2019t he?\u201d In this instance, as administrationof\ufb01cials admitted later, they believed there were several reasons toinvade Iraq, but WMD seemed the best bumper sticker on which tohang the defense of their preferred policy. It was particularly so withregard to one important constituency: Democrats in Congress. For allthe recent failures, intelligence retains some mystique; at least, it is dif-\ufb01cult for politicians to defend views that are at odds with intelligence.For the October 2002 NIE to argue that \u201che does\u201d did not settle thequestion for Democrats but did make it easier for those who were onthe fence to side with a then-popular president.\nThis increased temptation to use intelligence in support of policy\nseems to argue for insulating intelligence from policy, for repaintingthe bright white line that many of us have sought to blur. Therefore,if policy and intelligence can \ufb01nd new ways of interacting, the line\n182 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nbetween them also will blur and, logically, the risks of politicizationwill rise. In that sense, the changes in both the politics of foreign policyand the nature of the intelligence target would seem to argue for newways to protect intelligence from politicization.\nIn a fascinating conversation in 2006, George Shultz, secretary of\nstate in the Reagan administration, re\ufb02ected on different DCIs withwhom he had worked and on the different relationships betweenintelligence and policy they embodied.\n24The contrast was marked\nbetween what he called the \u201cHelms approach\u201d and the \u201cCaseyapproach.\u201d Richard Helms, DCI in the Nixon administration, embod-ied the sharp separation of intelligence of\ufb01cers from policy. Whenhe briefed senior policy meetings, he left the meeting after his brief-ing. His remit was only intelligence. By contrast, William Casey,DCI in the Reagan administration, actively sought Cabinet status andbehaved as a Cabinet of\ufb01cer, mixing intelligence brie\ufb01ng and policyadvocacy.\nOn balance, Shultz, a person of the old school, favored the Helms\napproach, but he recognized the cost. The approach risked irrele-vance, those \ufb01ne answers to unasked questions that so troubled mewhile in government. For Shultz, the way to square the circle was tohave policy of\ufb01cials, including those at the top of government, activelyengaged in question-asking and probing. Only then would they be wellserved by intelligence. Stated in terms of this chapter, for Vice Presi-dent Dick Cheney to journey to Langley to work through CIA anal-yses of Iraqi WMD programs before the Iraq war would be a goodmove, in Shultz\u2019s terms, if intelligence hewed to the Helms approach.Shultz did not say it, but Cheney\u2019s active engagement with intelligencemight risk politicization if intelligence did not feel protected throughindependence.\nOnly time will tell whether the changed world of transnational tar-\ngets and the need it imposes for intelligence and policy to work moreclosely, in fact, will lead to more risk of politicization. For now, thepressing need apparently is to \ufb01nd new ways of interacting \u2013 sense-making, for instance. Yet, the age of terror and other transnationaltargets will still throw out puzzles or puzzle-like issues on which poli-cies will seem or can be made to seem to turn: for example, the debateover contacts between Saddam Hussein\u2019s government and Al Qaeda.In the future as in the past, policy makers will seek analyses to suit\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 183\ntheir policy preference, operators will seek intelligence to validatetheir actions, and agencies will look for assessments to justify theirbudgets. For all the hits intelligence and analysis have taken, the temp-tations of leaders to either try to turn policy issues into intelligencequestions or use intelligence to make the case for their preferred poli-cies seem likely to grow.\nIntelligence is becoming less special or unusual and a more com-\nmon feature of American policy making. Like it or not, it is alsobecoming more transparent, if not more open. That gradual changehas been driven not only by investigative reporting but also by thechange in targets: if the \ufb01ght against terrorism gives pride of place tointelligence, it also has multiplied the numbers of those who wouldmake claims on intelligence \u2013 from foreign cooperators to state andlocal authorities. In the process, the nature of the business is chang-ing, if perhaps too slowly.\nIf the changed target has changed the intelligence problem, it has\nalso recon\ufb01gured the policy problem. The Soviet threat could bedeterred but the threat posed by terrorists cannot, at least not in any-\nwhere near the same degree. The terrorist threat has to be prevented,\nwhich requires policies that seek to work to back up the chain fromadversaries\u2019 actions to their intentions before they act. If terrorist foesact, policy has failed. Thus, prevention puts a premium on intelligence.The irony is not only that the farther up that chain, the more \u201ciffy\u201dintelligence usually will be, it is also that administrations will want touse intelligence to justify actions taken in the name of prevention, inadvance of pressing, obvious need.\nThese circumstances require a second look at ideas and institutions\nto insulate intelligence from political pressure. The long decline of thecongressional intelligence committees and, especially, their slide intosharp partisanship do not seem likely to be reversed before the bitterdivisions of their parent bodies are muted. Neither does the 9/11 Com-mission\u2019s recommendation of a single point of oversight for the twohouses seem to have a realistic chance of being implemented. Recen-tralizing oversight in a single committee in each house might be more\nthinkable and it could make the process of oversight less political byreducing the number of players. I return to these issues in Chapter 9.\nDespite its drawbacks, limiting the DNI to a set term, like that of\nthe FBI director, should be rethought. The argument against a \ufb01xed\n184 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nterm was that of relevance: if the DCI, now the DNI, were to be thepresident\u2019s principal intelligence advisor, he or she should be someonewho has a good relationship with the president \u2013 a person chosen, notimposed. Now, however, if the circumstances have shifted toward theneed for more political insulation, a \ufb01xed term for the DNI may notbe a bad idea. DNIs would still carefully tend their relationships withthe White House, but they would have somewhat more room to telltruth to power in extreme circumstances.\nFinally, for all its faults, the risks of politicization over those puzzles\nor puzzle-like issues underscore the need for a careful process to pro-duce NIEs or something similar. I came away from my time runningthe NIE process skeptical of both process and product. It was slowand \u2013 despite all our efforts to the contrary \u2013 both disconnected fromthe policy process and likely to produce a hedged and lamely wordedresult. My skepticism was about whether the process could produceenough relevance.\nAgain, however, the changed circumstances shift the argument. As\nthe \ufb02awed October 2002 NIE testi\ufb01ed, something like the NIE pro-cess is no safeguard against the perils of mindset. However, the pro-cess provides some insulation against \u201chouse\u201d views by forcing thehouses to argue and against cherry-picking by producing one com-prehensive intelligence answer. Innovations in process and tradecraftalso could provide some insulation. Having the collection specialistsin the room should help analysts \u2013 and customers \u2013 to better judgesources. More \u201cwhat if?\u201d and other techniques of alternative analysisshould broaden the hypotheses that get considered, as would wideningthe process to consider more information and expertise from outsideintelligence and even outside government.\nMy experience with NIEs also left me admiring the British practice\nof including of\ufb01cials from policy agencies in their Joint IntelligenceCommittee process \u2013 at all levels from the drafting through the meet-ings of the Committee itself. Then, my reason for admiration was rel-evance: perhaps, with policy of\ufb01cers participating, the results of theprocess might provide an answer to a question someone was actuallyasking. Now, including policy of\ufb01cials from the start might produce auseful argument about exactly what the question at issue for policy \u2013and, thus, for intelligence \u2013 really is.\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 185\nTable 7.3.

Yet,after the end of the Cold War, intelligence\u2019s customers expanded and,after September 11, the numbers exploded. Table 7.3 displays the newcustomers and characterizes their needs.\nThe \ufb01rst three new sets of consumers predated September 11.\nThe \ufb01rst and, so far, easily the most important is military comman-ders in the \ufb01eld. Their arrival as customers coincided with the endof the Cold War but was not a product of it. As Chapters 4 and 5emphasize, the change is dramatic. Technical intelligence-collectionsystems, most of them satellite-based, were for most of the Cold Wartoo slow in retrieval times to be of use to battle\ufb01eld commanders.Remarkable advances in bandwidth and other communications tech-nology resolved that problem, permitting targeting information \u2013 the\n186 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nDMPIs \u2013 derived from SIGINT and IMINT to be transmitted to air-plane cockpits within minutes or seconds, not hours. Intelligence fromsystems that were originally designed to help understand the SovietUnion can now be used to produce those DMPIs.\nThe second new set of customers was a direct result of the Cold\nWar\u2019s end. As it ended, intelligence was on the alert for new cus-tomers; it \ufb01rst found them in \u201cdomestic\u201d federal agencies, such asCommerce, whose global reach was expanding with globalization ofthe economy. With tight budgets and expanding activities, they werelooking for help wherever they could \ufb01nd it; intelligence, with its ser-vice mission, was a natural \ufb01t. Those new customers mostly were inter-ested in immediate support, more like staff work than longer termanalysis. With more customers and fewer resources themselves, theintelligence agencies became hard-pressed to keep up with the \ufb02oodof short-term questions they were asked; because intelligence is inthe service business, turning away new customers or sloughing off oldones is painful. As previous chapters discussed, what got squeezed wasintelligence\u2019s capacity to conduct deeper analysis.\nAfter the end of the Cold War, peacekeeping and other contin-\ngency operations mushroomed, often in countries that had not been ofhigh priority for intelligence. In many countries, any foreign presenceon the ground was stray academics but also, in particular, NGOs \u2013especially those in the business of humanitarian relief, such as theInternational Red Cross, CARE, and M \u00b4edecins san Fronti `eres. They\nwere often skeptical of government and more so of intelligence; how-ever, they also eventually welcomed the idea that someone caredabout their issues. They knew about local circumstances; therefore,like the new \u201ccustomers\u201d that arose after September 11, they were asmuch sources as they were consumers.\nThe other sets of new customers are a direct result of September 11.\nBecause the war against terrorism of necessity is one of prevention \u2013a point emphasized throughout this book \u2013 it is an intelligence \ufb01ght.Intelligence is imperative if terrorists, who cannot be deterred in theCold War manner, are to be prevented from acting. That means, \ufb01rst,\nthat a whole new set of federal agencies \u2013 from the Border Patrolto the Centers for Disease Control \u2013 is now engaged in the war onterrorism and thus requires intelligence if the agencies are to be partof prevention.\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 187\nTheir needs differ across agencies but generally are both strate-\ngic and tactical. The Border Patrol and the Transportation SecurityAdministration (TSA), for instance, want both strategic understand-ing of likely terrorist in\ufb01ltration routes and more immediate tacticalsupport, such as warning of impending movements or signs of sus-picious behavior. Some of the new customers will have considerableintelligence capacity of their own by creating new organizations (e.g.,the Intelligence and Analysis organization at the DHS), by enhancingexisting intelligence organizations (e.g., the DEA), or by more explic-itly conceiving of their work as intelligence-driven (e.g., the BorderPatrol).\nA second set of new customers consists of those eighteen thousand\nstate and local authorities. Their needs, both strategic and tactical, aresimilar to the new federal agencies, but they are helped most if bothanalysis and information are speci\ufb01c to their jurisdiction. If the Wash-ington policy tribe wants intelligence now, state and local authorities\nwant it here. As discussed later, all except the largest police depart-\nments \u2013 New York, Los Angeles, and a few others, with New York in aspecial category \u2013 are too small and stretched by ordinary police workto either build much capacity for analysis or conduct special, purpo-sive intelligence-gathering in the \ufb01ght against terrorism. This meansthat cops on the beat can be the war\u2019s \u201ceyes and ears,\u201d but only if theyget tips on what to look for as they go about their usual policing.\nMost \u201cpublic\u201d infrastructure, such as information, \ufb01nance, and\ntransportation, is now in private hands, and those private-sectorinfrastructure managers comprise another important new set of cus-tomers. Their needs are also both strategic and tactical and, for them,speci\ufb01c to both sector and location. The federal alert in 2004 that sin-gled out a threat to \ufb01nancial institutions in the New York and Wash-ington areas addressed that combination of needs. The sectors differsharply in how organized or prepared they were before September 11,as well as in how ready they are to work with the government. Rail-roads, for instance, had a number of security measures in place before2001, although primarily to guard against theft; given their close rela-tionship with the government, they moved quickly to take additionalmeasures.\n25By contrast, the information sector, most of whose man-\nagers had spent their career seeking to free their industry of govern-ment regulation, shied away from anything that smacked of \u201csecurity\u201d\n188 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nand, hence, government intervention. The last thing they wanted tohear was, \u201cWe\u2019re from the government and we\u2019re here to help you.\u201d\nFinally, private citizens are important new customers. They are\nconcerned about terrorism, perhaps well beyond the cold facts \u2013 apoint emphasized in Chapter 2. Former State Department counter-terrorism chief, L. Paul Bremer, said that \u201cterrorism goes from zeroto sixty faster than any other issues in American politics.\u201d By the pollscited in Chapter 2, it does not drop back to twenty very fast even inthe absence of fresh attacks on the United States. It was in that con-text that my \u201cRAND answer\u201d \u2013 that is, nothing \u2013 to the question ofwhat people should do to protect themselves and their families was sounsatisfying. People want information, but the challenge for govern-ments is to warn without terrifying. Terrorism is about terror, and somuch of what the U.S. government did in the wake of September 11accomplished the terrorists\u2019 terrorizing for them. On that score, Icame up with a bumper sticker for which I still lack the vehicle: \u201cTakethe terror out of terrorism.\u201d Building the vehicle is the challenge ofgetting intelligence to private citizens in the war on terrorism.\nwhat\u2019s called \u201cinformation-sharing\u201d but isn\u2019t\nAt the federal level, the simple fact of September 11 was a power-ful impetus to moving information within and across agencies and toworking together.\n26New institutional creations, such as the NCTC\nand the DNI, have helped but there is a long way to go. Beforethe attacks, the different cultures compounded the effect of the wallbetween intelligence and law enforcement. For instance, FBI agentshave Top Secret clearances, but few are cleared into the SCI, whichis the \u201cwoof and warp\u201d of intelligence. Therefore, when faced byunfamiliar FBI counterparts in meetings, CIA of\ufb01cers might be gen-uinely uncertain about how much they could say, and vice versa forFBI agents, who feared that inadvertent disclosures might jeopardizeprosecutions. The safest course was to say nothing. If the conversa-tion turned to domestic matters, then the CIA of\ufb01cials would also beuncertain about how much they should hear .\nIf moving information across federal agencies is the \ufb01rst fron-\ntier, the second and third are even more dif\ufb01cult because they aresharing with ourselves, across levels of government and across the\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 189\npublic\u2013private distinction. Despite a number of initiatives, the con-clusions of the Markle Foundation task force about the DHS sev-eral years ago apply to the government as a whole: \u201cDHS has yet toarticulate a vision of how it will link federal, state, and local agen-cies in a communications and sharing network, or what its role will bewith respect to the TTIC and other federal agencies.\u201d\n27There is no\ngainsaying the dif\ufb01culty of the task; the DHS and the FBI share theresponsibility. Not only is infrastructure for moving information lack-ing but also much of the relevant information is classi\ufb01ed. To stateand local of\ufb01cials, however, the classi\ufb01cation problems often look likea smokescreen that conceals an attitude on the part of federal of\ufb01cialsthat the war against terrorism is a federal \ufb01efdom.\nAlthough \u201cinformation-sharing\u201d has become a mantra in the \ufb01ght\nagainst terrorism, existing procedures \u2013 with each intelligence agencycontrolling the information it produces \u2013 make it dif\ufb01cult to shareacross U.S. intelligence, much less get information to state and localauthorities. More generally, innovations in intelligence analysis run\ndirectly into existing security procedures, which are designed to limitinformation to those with a \u201cneed to know,\u201d not share it. Yet, newanalytic insights are likely to arise precisely from those who cometo information with a fresh perspective, who have noneed to know.\nThe fundamental challenge is reshaping how the U.S. governmentthinks of information and how that information should be used andcontrolled. Both the 9/11 Commission and the WMD Commissiondeserve credit for at least raising the challenge. In addressing it, thelanguage of information-sharing is both tepid and misleading.\n28\nCurrent rhetoric about the \u201ctransformation\u201d of the intelligence\ncommunity celebrates exploiting information derived from the fullspectrum of secret and open courses. Such terms as multi-INT and\nfusion analysis are the catch phrases; the favorite is connecting the\ndots. Yet, every innovation requires more sharing and therefore runs\ndirectly into existing security policies. As a result, paradoxically, someof the most interesting multi-INT experiments we discovered in thecourse of RAND research have not been virtual; rather, they havedepended on place. That is, as long as they were small and exper-imental, they could obtain license to operate \u201cwithin the securityfence,\u201d sharing information in ways that the originating agencies prob-ably would not have permitted on a larger scale. In one example, an\n190 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nanalyst literally faces a number of computer screens, \u201cfusing\u201d infor-mation by rolling his chair from one screen to the next \u2013 what wecalled \u201cwheeled fusion.\u201d\n29At the NCTC, analysts\u2019 computers have\nstacks of \u201cpizza boxes\u201d \u2013 that is, hard drives for different informa-tion sources than cannot be fused directly. There is a clear need formore candor between the administration and Congress over costs ofthe current information-security system.\nFrom the outside, the security issues look daunting, but insiders sel-\ndom mention them. They are so used to them that they hardly notice \u2013a sad indicator of how dif\ufb01cult change will be. In one sense, the prob-lem of security is less pressing now, at least in principle. During theCold War, intelligence was dependent on a small number of collectors;therefore, any single-point exposure was deeply damaging. Arguably,that situation is less frequent now with many and varied targets andmuch more information. Even if that is true, however, it still meansthat intelligence must recognize (as Silicon Valley has) that innova-tions that confer advantage are \ufb02eeting. If advantage is to be main-tained, it will require a short cycle in producing new innovations.\nThe 9/11 Commission recognized that the issues are less technical-\nthan policy-related in nature. It recommended creating a government-wide \u201ctrusted information network\u201d to share information horizon-tally, using the model suggested by a recent task force organized bythe Markle Foundation (cited previously). For the WMD Commis-sion, the December 2004 bill\u2019s provisions on that score, however,raised as many questions as they answered. The bill created a programmanager to build such a network for the war on terrorism. Yet, thatmanager was to be located outside the intelligence community andreport to the president \u2013 a recognition that the information-sharingproblem runs well beyond intelligence. In the end, the program man-ager for the ISE effectively works for the DNI, which is more straight-forward even if it limits the manager\u2019s mandate.\nThe ISE mission statement is a terse description of the problem:\n\u201cToday\u2019s ISE consists of multiple sharing environments designed toserve \ufb01ve communities: intelligence, law enforcement, defense, home-land security, and foreign affairs. Historically, each community devel-oped its own policies, rules, standards, architectures, and systems tochannel information to meet mission requirements. Prior to 9/11, theneed for coordinated and trusted interagency partnerships was not\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 191\nuniversally recognized and thus gaps and seams existed in the shar-ing of information across all levels of government. ...W e envision a\nfuture ISE that represents a trusted partnership among all levels ofgovernment in the United States, the private sector, and our foreignp a r t n e r s ....\u201d\n30\nYet, the ultimate dif\ufb01culty is not mandate but rather policy.\nFramed as information-sharing, the solution is one that the nation\u201ccannot get there from here.\u201d Rather, the challenge is what might becalled coproduction \u2013 that is, jointly producing information across the\nfederal structure.\n31It requires reshaping security to effectively con-\nfront the threats ahead \u2013 which requires perhaps the ultimate changein culture. It will not come soon.\nIn the meantime, a number of smaller proposals can at least ame-\nliorate immediate problems. For instance, intelligence analysts, likeother professionals, want to play at the top of their game; therefore,their reports inevitably begin with the most classi\ufb01ed \u2013 and, thus, leastshareable \u2013 information. The 9/11 Commission suggested the oppo-site; that is, starting any report by separating information from sourcesand writing \ufb01rst at the level that can be most easily shared. (Someagencies, such as the NSA, write different versions but typically startwith the most classi\ufb01ed, then adjust downward.) If intelligence con-sumers wanted more, they could query the system under whateverrules were in place, leaving an audit trail of requests. Many \u2013 perhapsmost \u2013 potential consumers would not even know what to ask for now.\nAlready, many agencies have reached out for translators into pools\nof people they would not have tapped before: immigrants who havespent much of their adult life abroad. Certainly, it is possible to imag-ine different types of clearances for different types of jobs. In 2008,the DNI, Mike McConnell, spoke of obtaining clearances within amonth for even \ufb01rst- and second-generation Americans. They wouldthen be followed carefully with constant surveillance \u2013 \u201clifecycle mon-itoring.\u201d\n32He also set in motion a review of classi\ufb01cation policy.33\nThe military is creative during coalition operations in using \u201ctear\nline\u201d intelligence so that information can be separated from indi-cations about the source and transferred to non-American coalitionpartners. There is no reason that the FBI and the DHS cannot be com-parably creative in getting information to uncleared partners. Now,the FBI JTTFs are the principal means that the federal government\n192 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nhas for working with state and local authorities. Yet, those are builtaround FBI communications and require state and local participantsto be cleared at the Top Secret level.\nOn the collection side, the terrorist threat to the homeland is\nimpelling agencies \u2013 speci\ufb01cally, the FBI and the DHS \u2013 to think oftheir of\ufb01cers as \u201cembedded collectors.\u201d Before September 11, FBIagents collected a lot of information but concentrated on the portionthat was immediately relevant to the speci\ufb01c case being investigated.As embedded collectors, they would recognize that the informationthey collect has value beyond the case, to others, if not immediately tothem. In addition to the FBI, the DHS has eighteen thousand agentsin Customs and Border Protection (CBP), \ufb01fteen thousand employ-ees in Citizenship and Immigration Services, and forty-eight thousandscreeners in TSA \u2013 all potential intelligence collectors \u2013 not to men-tion six hundred thousand state and local law enforcement of\ufb01cers.\nDHS only recently acquired the mandate to collect intelligence and\nthe word collection remains something of a taboo, but the capacity\nexists. To be sure, embedded collectors raise a host of civil-libertiesissues. More practically, those collectors need to know what to lookfor and how to pass on what they observe. Gilman Louie, presidentof In-Q-Tel, the CIA\u2019s high-tech venture-capital company, likens theneed to having a \u201csoda straw\u201d reaching down to the cop on the beat.Now, however, there is no infrastructure for the straw, let alone guid-ance and policy to govern what should be pushed or pulled throughthat straw in either direction.\nstate and local responses to terrorism\nThe challenge of sharing with ourselves is common to the UnitedStates and its major global partners, but the U.S. federal structureposes special obstacles. It means that there are those eighteen thou-sand authorities at the state and local level to coordinate, of widelyvarying size, capacity, and vulnerability. As a starting point, it is worthobserving that while most discussion of information-sharing in the\ufb01ght against terrorism after September 11 concentrated on the fed-eral government, state and local law enforcement agencies (LEAs)are the nation\u2019s eyes and ears in that \ufb01ght.\n34So, it seemed useful to\nsome of us at RAND to look at intelligence from the bottom up rather\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 193\nTable 7.4.

What are thosestate and local authorities doing differently now, after September 11,to collect and process information? Ultimately, what might an \u201cideal\u201ddivision of labor among the various levels of government look like?\nLEAs\u2019 involvement in intelligence activities designed to counter\nterrorist actions ranges from investigation, including electronic sur-veillance, of possible criminal acts (typically those authorized byTitle III) to collecting information in the normal course of policingactivities but that is not related to any speci\ufb01c criminal case.\n36Tra-\nditionally, that information would have been handed over \u201cthe wall\u201dto the FBI for its continued investigation and assessment. Other rel-evant state and local LEA intelligence activity now occurs in moredirect partnership with or supervised by federal authorities. The pre-eminent authority is the FBI-led JTTFs, which now exist in all \ufb01fty-sixFBI \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces in the United States and in many other cities as well.\n37\nThe number of JTTFs increased from 36 in 2001 to 101 in 2006.\nOf the eighteen thousand LEAs across the United States, only\nabout a thousand have a hundred or more full-time sworn of\ufb01cers. Itis not surprising that for many of those LEAs, especially the smallerones, terrorism is not a major issue. As Table 7.4 indicates, substan-tial majorities of state LEAs indicated knowledge of terrorist groupswithin their state, but only a \ufb01fth of local LEAs indicated knowledgeof such groups operating in their jurisdiction. Most local LEAs (i.e.,\n194 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nTable 7.5.

About16 percent of local LEAs had a specialized terrorism unit, while threeof four states reported such a unit. Local LEA terrorism units typicallyhave a more limited mission (i.e., primarily information-sharing); stateLEA terrorism units are more likely to take on more expansive roles(e.g., training).\nMost LEAs at both the state and local level conducted terrorism-\nthreat assessments. Local LEAs were more likely to have conductedan assessment only after September 11; about half of the states hadconducted their assessment prior to September 11. It is not surpris-ing that there was a correlation between the size of the LEA andthreat-assessment activity: the larger the local LEA, the more likelyit was to have conducted an assessment. As Table 7.5 indicates,only about one of three local LEAs collaborated with an FBI JTTF.Again, the larger the local LEA, the more likely it is that it par-ticipated in a JTTF. For local authorities, participating in JTTFs\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 195\nTable 7.6.

In con-trast, nearly all state LEAs collaborated with JTTFs for the samereasons, as well as for more expansive reasons, such as assisting withinvestigations.\nMost states and close to a majority of local LEAs reported need-\ning more and better terrorism-threat information, and most states anda third of local authorities registered requirements for more man-power (Table 7.6). The need for better terrorism-threat informationwas con\ufb01rmed in a 2003 survey, which found that both state and localorganizations were looking to the DHS for intelligence informationand information about the terrorist threat within their jurisdiction. Oflocal LEAs, 62 percent wanted more such information.\n38\nDespite a desire for more detailed intelligence information, few\nlocal LEAs were in a position to receive it. Only 7 percent of localagencies indicated having applied for security clearances for their per-sonnel after September 11; of those that had applied, only half indi-cated that all of their personnel had received the clearances. Indeed,\n196 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nstate of\ufb01ces of emergency management and state public health depart-ments were more likely than LEAs to have sought security clearancesfor their personnel after the September 11 attacks. Portland, Oregon,withdrew its police from the FBI JTTF, ostensibly over the refusal ofthe FBI to grant the mayor a security clearance \u2013 an issue that is aproblem for the JTTFs.\n39It is understandable that many elected of\ufb01-\ncials and senior local police of\ufb01cers chafe at having to be \u201ccleared\u201d bythe FBI.\nDetailed interviews with eight local LEAs con\ufb01rmed the survey\n\ufb01nding that local police generally have not created separate unitsfor counterterrorism intelligence. Counterterrorism-intelligence\u2013gathering and analysis tend to occur as part of a larger criminalintelligence unit. Neither has the terrorist threat led to large-scalechanges in the organizational structure of most local police depart-ments. In general, local police have increased their commitment ofhuman resources to counterterrorism efforts, which usually comes atthe expense of other policing areas.\nThose departments have little capacity to analyze the information\nthey collect or receive; although federal grants have been available,most of those were used \u2013 especially initially \u2013 for equipment andconsequence management, not analysis and training. The Septem-ber 11 attacks led to a sharp increase in the amount of counterter-rorism information that is shared within and among local police andtheir federal counterparts. Paradoxically, however, the sheer numberof cooperating agencies sometimes inhibits progress in responding tothe terrorist threat. Several states quit the Multistate AntiterrorismInformation Exchange (MATRIX) out of concerns that included pri-vacy and the social impact of interstate data-sharing.\n40They did so\neven though MATRIX did not have intelligence-gathering functionsbut rather focused on enabling information-sharing across state lines.\nThe survey and case studies portray a varied set of state and espe-\ncially local responses to the threat of terrorism. For many of the local-ities surveyed, perhaps most, terrorism is a threat that may come buthas not yet. The \ufb01ndings tend to belie the notion that counterterror-ism intelligence is a pervasive function among LEAs. Instead, the sur-vey \ufb01ndings, which re\ufb02ect heightened awareness associated with theOklahoma City and September 11 attacks, suggest that the \u201ceyes andears\u201d capability is concentrated among the larger departments. These\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 197\nare the LEAs that are investing in training, response plans, coordina-tion, and other preparedness measures, which, in turn, suggests thatthe process of shaping and directing state and local LEA involvementin intelligence activities may be a narrower and more focused chal-lenge than is often implied by the eyes and ears metaphor.\nOverall, however, state and local intelligence-gathering has in-\ncreased, at least as measured by wiretaps for law enforcement pur-poses. As Table 7.5 indicates, state and local intercept orders doubledbetween 2000 and 2006, and communications per order nearly tripled.Federal orders nearly doubled by 2005, then declined, and communi-cations per order grew somewhat. Table 7.7 reports the numbers ofintercept orders for law enforcement purposes approved by federaland state and local judges, along with the average number of commu-nications intercepted per order. The sixth column in Table 7.7 reportsthe number of federal intercept orders granted under the FISA, fornational-security purposes. It is not surprising that those numbersincreased sharply after September 11 and doubled between 2000 and2006.\nThere has been considerable attention given to privacy and civil-\nliberties considerations at the federal level, especially after the PatriotAct, which widened authority not just for the FISA but also for inves-tigation and surveillance by other means. By contrast, there has beenmuch less attention given to what is happening or what might beauthorized at the state and local level and virtually no research onlaw and practice at those levels.\n41\nThe numbers in Table 7.7 should be reviewed with caution. First,\nthe state and local numbers probably understate the facts, for sev-eral reasons. In 2001, for instance, forty-six states had laws permit-ting interceptions, but only twenty-\ufb01ve states reported using thatauthority. If the states under-report to the federal government, thenlocalities also may under-report to the states. Second, the purposeof the interceptions is not evident because terrorism is a problemfor both intelligence and law enforcement. Thus, while by de\ufb01nitionthe FISA wiretaps were for intelligence, as opposed to law enforce-ment, they might have generated leads or other information rele-vant to criminal prosecution. More to the point, although many statesare in the process of broadening their authority to intercept com-munications, in most cases and in most places the purpose is law\nTable 7.7.

If the wiretaps generate information that is useful in thewar on terrorism but notgermane to any ongoing criminal investiga-\ntion, that information will be a by-product.\nFrom interviews with local police departments \u2013 Las Vegas, for\nexample \u2013 it seems likely that if the local authorities undertookterrorism-related surveillance for intelligence purposes, they almostalways did so with federal of\ufb01cials through the JTTFs. If so, then therequest for surveillance would go through FISA channels and anysubsequent oversight would be through federal courts. The role ofstate courts in overseeing police investigations usually is in the form ofFourth Amendment litigation arising from a criminal prosecution. Ithas been \u2013 and probably will continue to be \u2013 rare to see state courtsruling on the constitutionality of post\u2013September 11 legislation likethe Patriot Act.\nAfter September 11, many states began to discuss more per-\nmissive reforms of their wiretap legislation.\n42Those measures typi-\ncally expanded which crimes would justify wiretaps; who could grantauthority; who could implement wiretaps; and authorization to con-duct \u201croving\u201d wiretaps across broader geographic areas, as well as thedevices subject to interception.\nThe last measure \u2013 expanding authority to new devices \u2013 merely\nbrings state laws into line with the prevailing federal statute, the Elec-tronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986, which updatedthe standards for newer technologies, such as cell phones and e-mail.\n43\nThus, the issues raised are mostly those of whether local of\ufb01cials willget the training needed to operate such wiretaps. Similarly, rovingwiretaps that permit surveillance of any communications device thetarget may use, instead of specifying a particular telephone or thelike, are mostly a modernization of legislation. Roving wiretaps werepermitted under ECPA but not under the FISA until the Patriot Actbrought the two into harmony. States are moving to modernize theirstatutes in the same way. This implies, however, that just as federaljudges can issue orders for the entire nation, some states are per-mitting judges to issue orders that extend beyond the jurisdictionalbounds of the court. Florida, Virginia, and Maryland have such pro-visions.\n44Although these provisions recognize the fact that terrorism\nrespects few boundaries, they raise the prospects of \u201cjudge-shopping\u201d\n200 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nand of decreased supervision of interceptions performed beyond theoriginating court\u2019s jurisdiction.\na division of labor\nTo what does all this \ufb02ux in procedures amount? One way to evaluatethe \u201cSo what?\u201d question is to ask what are the comparative advan-tages of the different levels of government and of the private sector individing the task and then to evaluate what is happening against thatideal. The evaluation, in turn, suggests steps that might be taken tomove closer to that ideal.\nGiven the FISA, federal authorities would naturally take the lead\nin intelligence-gathering that is not connected to criminal investi-gation. The local authorities have neither money nor capacity forthat type of pure intelligence. The intelligence-gathering also wouldbe guided by federal regulations and overseen primarily by federalcourts. Ideally, the state and local authorities would conduct two typesof information- or intelligence-gathering: (1) investigation, includingelectronic surveillance, of possible criminal acts; and (2) collectionthat is incidental to the normal activities of LEA of\ufb01cers. The lat-ter becomes the eyes and ears of the cops on the beat, and the goalis domain awareness \u2013 what is going on in the jurisdiction, what isthe state of possible targets, and so on. Here, the shortfalls of currentpractice against an ideal are two, the \ufb01rst more doctrinal and the othermore practical.\nThe doctrinal problem is that both types of state and local\nintelligence-gathering involve enormous discretion \u2013 not an unfamil-iar issue in policing. However, terrorism compounds the problembecause the task is inherently preventing crimes, not enforcing thelaw after the fact. As states emulate the federal government in relax-ing their eavesdropping regulations, the line between intelligence andlaw enforcement blurs for them as well. Yet, the range of state report-ing \u2013 not to mention state regulation \u2013 of eavesdropping is enormous.The problem of guidelines travels all the way down the chain of com-mand: in discussions with police departments, most guidelines for thecounterterrorism mission at the local level are ad hoc and derive fromthe local chain of command.\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 201\nThe more practical shortfall is that local LEAs get neither much\nguidance about what to look for nor enough intelligence that is suf\ufb01-ciently speci\ufb01c to shape local operations. There is increasing recogni-tion that the problem is apparently only one of hardware \u2013 that is, the\u201cpipes\u201d actually to move information. To be sure, the piping remains aconsiderable problem, especially for many local departments; yet, pol-icy and guidelines are the still more formidable obstacles. As both thesurveys and cases suggested, the principal information-sharing mech-anism, the JTTFs, is constrained because it requires obtaining secu-rity clearances for the state and local participants at the level of theirFBI counterparts. The FBI focuses on cases and investigation; one ofits key functions is \u201cdecon\ufb02icting\u201d investigations \u2013 that is, parcelingout cases to JTTF member agencies for their investigations and thenensuring that the investigations do not work at cross purposes to oneanother.\nThe newer fusion centers, a DHS initiative, are meant to be com-\nplementary. If JTTFs work on cases once identi\ufb01ed, the fusion centersare meant to assemble strategic intelligence at the regional level. They\nalso seek to bring together federal of\ufb01cials with state and local of\ufb01-cials, including \u2013 in principle \u2013 reaching out to the private sector. Theresponsibility of the centers is to fuse foreign intelligence with domes-tic information in order to facilitate improved policy decision makingon issues of counterterrorism, crime, and emergency response.\n45How\nexactly to accomplish that remains a challenge.\nIn practice, the fusion centers are experiencing adjustment dif\ufb01cul-\nties, including poor or absent communication among centers. Not allfusion centers have statewide intelligence systems. They also do notall have access to law enforcement data or private-sector information.The problem of interoperability of systems that was widely criticizeddirectly after September 11 still exists. Because of the huge numberof systems and the resulting duplication, reviewing incoming informa-tion is extremely time-consuming.\nMoreover, as outward signs of the terrorist threat wane, many of\nthe centers are changing their focus from a pure counterterrorism mis-sion to an \u201call-hazards\u201d approach as priorities change at the local andregional levels. That change re\ufb02ects the simple fact displayed in thesurvey: for most localities, terrorism is not a major problem. That shift\n202 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nto an all-hazards approach may not be so negative as the \u201cdomestica-tion\u201d of the terrorist threat means that it increasingly resembles orga-nized crime.\nIn parallel, the federal government has encouraged the formation\nof industry Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs). Suchgroups had long existed in some sectors, such as communications andtransportation; now, in principle, they are meant to span seventeencritical infrastructure and key resource sectors. The ISACs, along withSector Coordinating Councils (SCCs), are meant to serve as centralpoints of information-sharing within each of the sectors and also to actas the liaison to the federal government. Their main functions are tofunnel threat information to facilities and to receive and collect infor-mation from facilities. For instance, the chemical-sector ISAC hassupported DNS information-sharing efforts since the department\u2019sinception and includes more than six hundred individuals represent-ing more than 430 different chemical companies.\n46\nAt this point, it is far from clear how or how much classi\ufb01ed intelli-\ngence information will be shared with private-sector companies andindividuals. The 2004 warnings about threats against U.S. \ufb01nancialinstitutions were still fairly general \u2013 although they did apply to partic-ular regions \u2013 and speci\ufb01c companies were noti\ufb01ed that they might betargets. The IT ISAC stresses \u2013 if not the classi\ufb01ed nature of bene\ufb01tsto members \u2013 at least the nonpublic opportunities to share details ofincidents or possible incidents among peers from other companies.\n47\nCoproduction is far from a real two-way street and reaching out\nto the private sector, the third frontier, is particularly troublesome. Inthe words of one recent assessment, \u201cThe \ufb02ow of information from theprivate sector to fusion centers is largely sporadic, event driven, andmanually facilitated.\u201d\n48Like cops on the beat, private managers of\ninfrastructure know their domain better than anyone else. Yet, inter-views suggest they have three reasons for being reticent about sharinginformation: \ufb01rst, they are concerned about revealing gaps in security;second, they do not want proprietary information to leak to competi-tors; and, third, passing information risks that they will become liablefor other shortcomings (e.g., environmental violations).\nTable 7.8 lists types of intelligence that, were they available , would\nbe of interest to state and local authorities and the private sector. Evi-dence from foiled attacks is underscored as perhaps of special interest,\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 203\nTable 7.8.

Bycontrast, suspicious activity reports (SARs) have proven to be notvery useful. Transmitting the reports has been an established part ofefforts to counter criminality in the \ufb01nancial sector, and there wereconcerns even before September 11 that the \u201cvolume of these reportswas interfering with effective law enforcement.\u201d\n49Since September\n11, the range of organizations obligated to submit such reports hasbroadened, and there have been calls from the private sector for bet-ter guidelines on what constitutes suspicious activity.\n50\nFormer Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld focused attention in the\nintelligence war on terrorism to the \u201cknown unknowns,\u201d what weknow we do not know, and especially to the \u201cunknown unknowns,\u201dwhat we do not know we do not know.\n51Yet, much of the Septem-\nber 11 failure turned on another category, the \u201cunknown knowns,\u201dwhat we did not know or had forgotten we knew. One of the striking\ufb01ndings from the surveys and cases is the importance of more analysisacross all of Rumsfeld\u2019s categories.\n204 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThat importance derives directly from the nature of the coun-\nterterrorism task. A traditional law enforcement investigation seeksto reconstruct the single trail from crime back to perpetrator. Bycontrast, the counterterrorism task, especially prevention, needs tolook at a number of paths, assembling enough information about eachto know when patterns are changing or something suspicious is afootalong a path. It is not only an intelligence-rich task; it is also a taskrich in intelligence analysis.\nIdeally, the analysis function would be split among the levels of\ngovernment. The federal level has a comparative advantage in specialsources, especially sources abroad. Its analysis will naturally concen-trate on those and on the broad \u201cconnect-the-dots\u201d function. Some-times, those sources and that analysis will provide warning suf\ufb01cientlyspeci\ufb01c to alert particular local authorities. In other cases, however, itwill remain general and will serve mostly to alert local of\ufb01cials aboutwhat they might look for \u2013 for example, a string of apparently unre-lated crimes involving false identities.\nThe federal government is struggling, through the NCTC and the\nDHS as well as a greatly expanded FBI intelligence function, to dobetter at its part of the ideal. Yet, what is even more striking is howlimited the analytic capacity is at the local level. Only the largest policedepartments have much of any capacity at all, with New York in aclass by itself. Yet, the local role in the division of analytic labor wouldbe to take the general guidance provided by the federal agencies andrelate it to local-domain awareness. What does new federal informa-tion or analysis add to that understanding of local circumstances?\nThe ideal and shortfalls against it suggest an agenda for doing\nbetter. The obvious \ufb01rst need is more training for more intelligencecapacity, especially in analysis, at the state and local levels. The train-ing would include techniques for increasing domain awareness and forundertaking local threat assessments. Yet, so far, federal-assistanceprograms emphasize equipment for consequence management, nottraining for intelligence \u2013 although that state of affairs is changing.\nMoreover, training might also address the other visible concern \u2013\nthe varied and ad hoc nature of guidelines for counterterrorism intel-ligence. The federal government might regulate through training. Itcould require training to speci\ufb01ed standards if a jurisdiction is toreceive funding from the DHS. More generally, greater and more\nMany Customers, Too Many Secrets 205\nexplicit federal funding for state and local intelligence agencies wouldpermit the federal authorities a greater regulatory role over what iscurrently a fairly loose and ad hoc process. It would encourage localpolice to develop internal guidelines (including mandate) and exter-nal oversight by tying them to funding.\nMore generally, although law enforcement throughout the United\nStates is fundamentally local in its structure, there is no reason thatlaw enforcement intelligence needs to be. A program like Commu-nity Oriented Policing Services (COPS), under which the federal gov-ernment supported additional law enforcement of\ufb01cers for a speci-\ufb01ed period, could be modi\ufb01ed to signi\ufb01cantly boost local intelligencecapabilities. A federal program on intelligence could operate simi-larly, with the federal government paying the cost of an intelligence\u201csupervisor\u201d for eligible LEAs. The supervisor could be selected bynational authorities (e.g., the FBI) and trained to national-intelligencestandards. This federal\u2013state link would embed federal capacity instate organizations. It might increase the \ufb02ow of intelligence from thelocal level to the national level as well as help standardize the \ufb02ow ofinformation.\nWhile the DHS has a legal mandate to take the lead in sharing intel-\nligence, as a practical matter, the lead in sharing is likely to continueto remain with the FBI through the JTTFs \u2013 although with the fusioncenters playing a more signi\ufb01cant role. The federal, state, and localLEAs need to jointly develop a de\ufb01nition of terrorism and apply itby requiring that terrorism cases, including surveillance, be processedthrough the JTTF. In any case, it would help if some agency were in\nthe lead, which is consistent with the recommendations of the DHSand the Justice Department in their recent National Criminal Intelli-gence Sharing Plan, which de\ufb01nes several recommendations regard-ing law enforcement\u2019s intelligence role in this area and how it couldbe improved.\n52It is a role that the DNI could play, as an honest bro-\nker without a direct bureaucratic stake. The DNI could develop bothlanes in the road for the different agencies, and standards for bothproducing intelligence and sharing it \u2013 in short, for coproducing intel-ligence in the \ufb01ght against terrorism.\nIt will be up to the courts, the federal courts in particular, to con-\ntinue assessing how the relaxed procedures in the intelligence war onterrorism are striking the balance between privacy and civil liberties\n206 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\non the one hand and security on the other. What is hinted at in oursurvey and cases is much more explicit when talking with federalhomeland-security intelligence of\ufb01cials. They believe that they arewithout much guidance in deciding, especially what they should dowith information they collect that happens to be about Americans.Can they keep it in databases? For how long and on what basis? It willbe the responsibility of the courts to enforce guidelines when constitu-tional or statutory standards apply and to put pressure on the execu-tive branch to issue clear guidelines when such standards do not apply.\nFinally, coproduction must be a two-way street. Local authorities,\nespecially the private sector, will not sustain the process, given theirreasons for reticence, if the information they supply does not go any-where and if they do not see value in the information they receive.Ultimately, expectations are critical. While the larger \ufb01rms know thefederal government and many of their security managers come fromcareers in law enforcement and intelligence, some of the smaller localauthorities still harbor grand hopes that the federal agencies can pro-duce information magic from behind the green door of classi\ufb01cation \u2013if only they will open it.\n8\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past?\nIntelligence, like all professions, has its own vocabulary. For most ofus,covert and clandestine are synonyms meaning \u201csecret.\u201d Not so for\nintelligence. There, clandestine does, indeed, mean secret. CIA spy-masters are the clandestine service; their relationship to the spies theyrecruit is meant to remain secret. (A former father-in-law of mine,a CIA veteran, relished pronouncing clandestine as \u201ccandle-stine,\u201d\nperhaps in ironic reference to what was not.) By contrast, for intel-ligence operations, covert means \u201cunacknowledged\u201d or \u201cdeniable\u201d; it\nis de\ufb01ned in the law as \u201cintended that the role of the United StatesGovernment will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly.\u201d\n1\nMy introduction to covert action was a fascinating one, moving as\na not-yet-minted, then freshly minted Ph.D. to Washington for the\ufb01rst time to work for the original Senate Select Committee on Intelli-gence \u2013 often called the \u201cChurch Committee\u201d after its chair, SenatorFrank Church (D-ID).\n2The investigations, hard on the heels of\nWatergate and allegations of covert U.S. intervention in Chile, werethe nation\u2019s \ufb01rst-ever look behind the green curtain of intelligence.I had written about presidential decision making and so expected towork on the role of intelligence analysis in those decisions.\nIn fact, I spent virtually all of my time on covert action \u2013 and\nmuch of that on Chile.\n3That stint in Washington was exhilarating\nand frustrating, and it produced one of few \u201caha\u201d moments I havehad researching in deeply classi\ufb01ed documents. Press accounts hadattributed to Henry Kissinger, then the national security advisor, thestatement: \u201cI don\u2019t see why the United States should stand by andwatch Chile go communist merely due to the stupidity of the Chilean\n207\n208 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\npeople.\u201d The line rang true enough, but I did not expect to and hadnot seen a source. Then, we received a tranche of highly classi\ufb01ed doc-uments, which included minutes from the \u201c40 Committee,\u201d the admin-istration\u2019s interagency committee for reviewing covert actions.\n4\nKissinger, a scholar, had changed the committee\u2019s recordkeeping\nfrom the terse notations of previous administrations \u2013 \u201cCIA project123 is approved,\u201d with no mention of operation or country \u2013 to thoseof a recording secretary. So there it was at the end of the notes onone meeting: \u201cThe chairman [that is, Kissinger] closed the meeting byo b s e r v i n gt h a th ed i d n \u2019 ts e ew h y ....\u201d\nWhen I re\ufb02ected some years later on covert action at book length,\nwhat struck me was how much the targets of U.S. covert action hadchanged from the 1940s to the 1990s and beyond.\n5Many of the\nCIA\u2019s early postwar targets, such as Iran\u2019s Mossadeq and Guatemala\u2019sArbenz, sought and almost pleaded not to be regarded as enemies ofthe United States. However, for later targets, such as Nicaragua\u2019s San-dinistas and Iran\u2019s Khomeini \u2013 not to mention Al Qaeda\u2019s bin Laden \u2013the United States was more useful as an enemy than a friend. Cuba\u2019sCastro bridged the two periods, with America-as-foe becoming thebest thing he had going for him.\nBy the end of the 1990s, a second theme was also apparent: major\nAmerican \u201csecret\u201d operations, from Nicaragua to Angola to Cam-bodia to Afghanistan, were not very secret and they were not evencovert. They had become \u201covert\u201d covert action, in that actions becamepublic not just when their results were known but also while they werein progress. Support for the Nicaraguan rebels, or Contras \u2013 the mostcontroversial example \u2013 was openly debated and openly funded. Nei-ther opponents nor supporters had reason to keep it secret; for its part,the Reagan administration regarded \u201ccovert\u201d action as good policyand good domestic politics \u2013 a key element of the Reagan Doctrine,which was intended to challenge Marxist\u2013Leninist states around theworld. Indeed, when the Reagan administration decided to sell armsto Iran and keep the operation secret, it turned inward, to the WhiteHouse staff.\n6In embroidering that operation to divert money for the\nContras, White House aides apparently kept the president ignorant inorder to protect him \u2013 providing him with \u201cplausible denial\u201d of thetype we were concerned about on the Church Committee and that theCIA had long since abandoned.\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 209\nNow, the United States has come full circle. Not only are most\ncovert actions not very secret, they are mostly paramilitary actionsin support of broader, primarily military counterterrorism operationsin an age of terror. The campaign against terrorism has thrown CIAcovert operators and Pentagon Special Operations Forces together innew ways. The successes of that cooperation in Afghanistan and Iraqhave been impressive. Because the operations are not very secret andbecause they are part of the broader campaign against a fearsomefoe \u2013 transnational terrorism \u2013 the questions of how to square themwith America\u2019s values are less evident. Yet, the process is making forless clarity about who does what and why. More important, it is com-plicating who authorizes lethal force and on what basis.\nThis chapter \ufb01rst reviews the early history that set the pattern for\nU.S. covert action in the half-century after World War II and makesinquiries into how the success or failure of covert actions should bejudged. The chapter then looks at the circumstances, both at homeand abroad, that changed covert action to \u201covert covert,\u201d and it arguesfor a bias toward acting openly, not covertly. If covert action is to beemployed, what lessons emerge from the history? The chapter thenasks how those lessons apply in current circumstances, and it con-cludes with a coda on how the oversight of intelligence by Congress,especially covert action, has functioned.\nearly \u201csuccesses\u201d set the pattern\nSpying may be the world\u2019s second oldest profession, but for theUnited States it was only the Cold War \u2013 coming on the heels ofAmerica\u2019s wartime experience with secret operations conducted bythe Of\ufb01ce of Strategic Services \u2013 that led to the creation of anintelligence service in peacetime and to covert operations. Spying \u2013HUMINT in the jargon of the trade \u2013 and covert action are super-\ufb01cially similar but, in fact, quite different, beyond the fact that the\ufb01rst is meant to be clandestine and the second merely covert. Bothinvolve secret relationships between U.S. intelligence of\ufb01cers and for-eigners. However, the point of spying is information, the U.S. of\ufb01ceris relatively passive, and the process is designed to protect the for-eign spy\u2019s link to the United States. For covert action, by contrast, thepurpose is to do something, the U.S. of\ufb01cer is active, and the process\n210 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ninherently risks being blown \u2013 the more ambitious the action, theriskier it is.\nWartime success and postwar threat: these comprised the backdrop\nfor the creation of the CIA. In a few years, America plunged fromthe euphoria of victory in World War II to the confrontation with alooming Soviet threat, when Western Europe seemed to teeter in thebalance. The \ufb01rst line of American response to the onset of the ColdWar was overt: the surge of assistance to Europe through the TrumanDoctrine and the Marshall Plan. However, the second line of responsewas renewed interest in what was then called covert psychological\nwarfare \u2013 what we could now call propaganda \u2013 as a way to respond\nto the Soviet Union by means that were less than war but more thannothing.\nIn this atmosphere, the NSC in June 1948 approved NSC 1012,\na plan that had originated with George Kennan, then-director ofthe State Department\u2019s Policy Planning Staff and the author of thefamous \u201cX\u201d article outlining the policy of containment of the SovietUnion. NSC 1012 was the turning point for covert action, expandingit from propaganda to direct intervention. In the words of the docu-ment, covert action consisted of\n. . . propaganda, economic warfare; preventive direct action, including sabo-\ntage, anti-sabotage, demolition and evacuation measures; subversion againsthostile states, including assistance to underground resistance movements,guerrillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anticom-munist elements.\n7\nNSC 1012 also codi\ufb01ed the notion of plausible denial: operations\nwere to be \u201cso planned and executed that any U.S. Governmentresponsibility for them is not evident to unauthorized persons and thatif uncovered the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim any respon-sibility for them.\u201d\nThe \ufb02edgling CIA\u2019s \ufb01rst success came that same year when its\ncovert support to the Italian Christian Democrats helped them beatback an electoral challenge from the Italian Communist Party. By1950, the United States had succeeded in the covert struggle in West-ern Europe and in Eastern Europe, its covert operations wound downto propaganda and intelligence-gathering. The center of the battleagainst communism, as of\ufb01cial Washington saw the world, moved\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 211\naway from Europe to small, weak countries. Europe had put the CIAinto the business of covert political action, but it was Asia that gotthe agency into secret paramilitary operations in the Korean War \u2013 apattern repeated a decade later in another Asian war, Vietnam.\nThe incoming Eisenhower administration called for a more active\nresponse to the Soviet threat than the passive containment of theTruman administration. CIA operators soon registered two successesthat set the pattern for the next two decades. On August 21, 1953,after a week of turmoil in the streets of Tehran, the Iranian primeminister, Mohammed Mossadeq \u2013 who had nationalized that coun-try\u2019s oil industry \u2013 surrendered. Three days later, the Shah, who had\ufb02ed Iran the previous week with his queen, returned to the capital. Athis palace a few days later, he offered a toast to Kermit \u201cKim\u201d Roo-sevelt, the chief of the CIA\u2019s Near East and Africa Division and theman who had improvised Mossadeq\u2019s downfall: \u201cI owe my throne toGod, my people, my army \u2013 and you!\u201d\n8\nThe next year, on June 16, 1954, Guatemalan Colonel Carlos\nCastillo Armas crossed the border into his country from Honduraswith a few hundred men trained and armed by the CIA. Pilots underCIA contract \ufb02ew air cover. The president of Guatemala, JacoboArbenz Guzman, was deserted by his air force and his army, whichrefused his order to arm workers and peasants. The American ambas-sador hastily arranged a transfer of power to the chief of the armedforces. (In a moment of tragicomedy, that man immediately pledgedthat he would continue the struggle against Castillo Armas, America\u2019sdesignated successor to Arbenz. Only after complicated negotiationsled by the ambassador did Castillo Armas emerge as president.\n9)\nThe Iran and Guatemala operations \u2013 code-named TPAJAX and\nPBSUCCESS, respectively \u2013 coming within a few years of the CIA\u2019ssuccess in Western Europe, made the agency\u2019s reputation and set thepattern for covert action in the years ahead. Small, cheap, fast, andtolerably secret, the operations encouraged Washington to think thatother covert actions could be likewise. When the next administrationdecided to confront revolution in Cuba, its covert response was thesame as in Guatemala; so were the CIA of\ufb01cers who carried it out.\nThe blush of short-term success amid the Cold War obscured sev-\neral cautions. In the early 1950s, both Iran and Guatemala were emi-nently vulnerable to manipulation by an outside power, particularly\n212 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nthe United States. In both, contending political forces were in closebalance. Those balances might have tipped against Mossadeq andArbenz even had the CIA not intervened. As a result, it appearedthat relatively small operations were enough to tip the balance. Yet,in both cases, those limited interventions might have failed. In fact,Roosevelt\u2019s \ufb01rst plot did fail; CIA Director Allen Dulles was readyto roll up the operation and bring the troops home. The CIA of\ufb01-cers who ran PBSUCCESS were under no illusions: if their decep-tions failed and Arbenz was able to get his military into combat, theinvaders would be overwhelmed.\nThus, success was purchased at the price of enlarging the interven-\ntion. American purposes did not change but the operational require-ments of achieving them did. Once the United States was committed,in secret and in a small way, its stakes increased, and the CIA tookthe next step. The effort to intimidate Arbenz became a paramilitarycampaign, if a small one. In the process, plausible deniability becameincreasingly tenuous.\nSix years later at the Bay of Pigs, deniability evaporated entirely.\n\u201cHow could I have been so stupid, to let them go ahead?\u201d\n10The words\nwere John Kennedy\u2019s. When the CIA-trained invasion force of Cubanexiles hit the beach in the early dawn hours of April 17, 1961, every-thing went wrong: the lives of brave Cubans were spent, the UnitedStates was seen to be intervening, and the intervention failed. Oncethe plan had changed (without anyone outside of the CIA noticing it)from a guerrilla operation into a full-\ufb02edged amphibious invasion, thechance of keeping it tolerably secret diminished to the vanishing point.\njudging success\nEvaluating covert action in retrospect is speculative, for it is bedev-iled by the imponderable of what might have been; history permits noreruns. Failures such as the Bay of Pigs are apparent, but successes aremore dif\ufb01cult to judge. Consider the CIA intervention in the Angolancivil war of 1975. On the surface, it was a failure: the Cuban- andSoviet-supported faction, the Popular Movement for the Liberationof Angola (MPLA), was installed while the American role in trying toprevent that outcome was being exposed. If, however, the initial pur-pose was more limited \u2013 for instance, to raise the price of victory for\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 213\nthe MPLA and its Soviet and Cuban backers \u2013 then Angola might becounted a short-term success. Yet, American of\ufb01cials did not conveythe impression that their aims actually were so limited, either at thetime or later.\nWhen covert actions succeeded in their short-term purposes, it may\nbe that the action, although marginal, was just the bit of \u201csupport forour friends\u201d that tipped the balance in the internal politics of a for-eign country. Conversely, it may be that the American support wasentirely super\ufb02uous, that the same successful outcome would haveensued without U.S. involvement. If this is true, then the only accom-plishment of the covert action was to implicate the United States andtarnish the success by labeling it \u201cmade in America\u201d when its exis-tence became known.\nA case in point was covert American support to opposition political\nparties and media in Chile during the presidential tenure (1970\u201373)of Salvador Allende, a self-proclaimed Marxist. There is no questionthat those parties and media were under pressure from the Allende\ngovernment.\n11The opposition forces survived to \ufb01ght another day,\nbut there is no telling whether CIA support for them was decisive orirrelevant.\nWhat isclear is the signal conveyed to history by the revelations\nof American covert action. In retrospect, most reasonably objec-tive observers conclude that Salvador Allende\u2019s experiment in Chilewould have failed on its own terms.\n12Yet, history\u2019s lesson is not that\nAllende fell of his own accord; history\u2019s lesson is that the UnitedStates overthrew him in 1973. That is the public perception eventhough this lesson is untrue in the narrow sense: Washington did notengineer his coup, nor did the CIA or the American military partic-ipate in it. The very fact of American covert action meant that, at aminimum, \u201cit is fair to say that the United States cannot escape someresponsibility for [Allende\u2019s] downfall.\u201d\n13\nBy the same token, in 1975, when South Africa intervened to back\nthe U.S.\u2013supported Angolan factions, the National Front for the Lib-eration of Angola (FNLA) and the National Union for the Total Inde-pendence of Angola (UNITA), a covert action originally intendedto counter the Soviet Union and Cuba then signaled something else:an alliance with the apartheid regime in Pretoria. When in Decem-ber 1975, the American Congress reacted by cutting off the CIA\n214 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\noperation, the cutoff only rati\ufb01ed what was seen as the inevitableresult \u2013 defeat \u2013 in the eyes of both Washington policy makers andthe rest of the world.\nIn a longer perspective, neither the Iran nor Guatemala operations\ncan fairly be given too much credit \u2013 or too much blame \u2013 for whathappened afterward in those countries. On the one hand, TPAJAXrestored the Shah of Iran to his throne where he remained for nearly aquarter-century, a pro-Western bastion in a turbulent region. Twenty-\ufb01ve years of relative stability is no mean feat in international affairs.On the other hand, American covert action identi\ufb01ed the Shah\u2019s Iranmore closely with the United States than was good for either the Shahor the United States.\nIn any case, however, the aspects of American policy that loomed\nso large in the Shah\u2019s downfall in 1979 were overt, not covert. Theycomprised his image as an American client, the waste and corruptionassociated with his massive U.S. arms purchases, and his own depen-dence on the United States. Those factors owed much more to Amer-ican policy during the 1970s than to the event of 1953.\nA similar conclusion also applies to Guatemala in 1953. If, in retro-\nspect, the \u201csuccess\u201d of PBSUCCESS also looks more ambiguous thanit seemed at the time, most of the blame or credit lies with Ameri-can foreign policy, not with covert action. PBSUCCESS did not makeit inevitable that Washington would then forget about Guatemala;it only made it possible. David Phillips, a CIA of\ufb01cer who workedon PBSUCCESS, the Bay of Pigs, and Chile, lamented that \u201cCastilloArmas was a bad president, tolerating corruption throughout his gov-ernment and kowtowing to the United Fruit Company more than hisown people.\u201d However, he argued that the United States:\n. . . could have prevented this with the vigorous exercise of diplomatic pres-\nsure . . . to assure that he pursued social reform for the many rather than venalsatisfaction for a few. Instead, Washington breathed a collective sigh of reliefand turned to other international problems.\n14\nSeveral covert operations of the 1950s remained secret for a long\ntime: the CIA\u2019s assistance to Tibetans resisting the domination of theirland by the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2013 regarded in intelligence loreas a successful holding action \u2013 is still a little-discussed operation,especially because it is an embarrassment now that Sino\u2013American\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 215\nrelations have thawed. The effort to unseat President Sukarno ofIndonesia, who had earned Washington\u2019s opposition for his espousalof nonalignment, ranged from covert political action to a paramilitaryoperation; it is not much better known than the Tibetan operation.\n15\nEven in the 1960s, several brief and limited interventions \u2013 small\nin terms of numbers of people involved although not in terms of pur-pose \u2013 remained secret for some time. The so-called Track II \u2013 a secreteffort to touch off a military coup in 1970 to prevent Allende frombeing seated as Chile\u2019s president, an operation run without the knowl-edge of the state or defense departments \u2013 was not revealed until \ufb01veyears after it happened. The sad plots in the early 1960s to assassinateFidel Castro stayed buried for ten years.\n16\nchanging targets, changing times\nYet, times changed. Major covert actions were likely to become pub-lic knowledge \u2013 sooner rather than later, perhaps before the operationwas over. In 1986, the arms sales to Iran became public even thoughthe leak did not initially come from Washington but rather from anarticle published in Beirut and in Arabic. Americans became moreskeptical of their government, of its information and its capacity \u2013 askepticism that was a legacy of the long history beginning with thelabel \u201cWatergate.\u201d By 1986, when Ronald Reagan, the most popularpresident in a long time, \ufb01rst denied that his administration had tradedarms sales to Iran for the release of American hostages in Lebanon,most Americans did not believe him \u2013 just as most Americans in 2006did not believe President George W. Bush when he talked about suc-cess in Iraq.\nThis skepticism was reinforced by the prominence of investigative\njournalism; every cub reporter aspired to be Woodward or Bernsteinof Watergate fame. The media had more people asking hard ques-tions, even of secret operations, and probing for leaks; fewer are pre-pared to take the government at its word. If reporters were more likelyto seek information on \u201csecret\u201d operations, so were they more likelyto \ufb01nd it. \u201cLeaking,\u201d always present, had become routine in Wash-ington; it was almost acceptable. Of\ufb01cials sometimes leaked informa-tion merely for the grati\ufb01cation of being pandered to by journalistsmore famous than themselves. More often, they leaked information to\n216 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nrally opposition to or, more rarely, support for a given policy. Admin-istration after administration, regardless of its political persuasion,declares war on leakers. Those wars always fail and they fail for a sim-ple reason: the ship of state is like no other, for it leaks from the top.\nOf\ufb01cials at the top of government are precisely those who know\nof covert actions and thus are most likely to take their opposition toparticular programs into the open. This is true of the executive branchand even more so of Congress, where this tendency is reinforced byinstitutional pride and, often, by the partisan politics of divided gov-ernment. On the whole, the intelligence committees of the House andSenate have kept secrets at least as well as the executive branch. Yet,their role in overseeing covert action means that those who mightoppose a particular project are more likely to know of it. The pro-cess creates a set of frustrated opponents who, on occasion, will gopublic with their frustration.\nNot every expos \u00b4e, however, has created a controversy. Even now,\nnot every covert action is controversial. For instance, of the forty orso covert actions underway in the mid-1980s, at least half were thesubject of some press account.\n17Yet, only several were controver-\nsial enough that the original leaks developed into continuing stories.Most of the other leaks were open secrets, more unacknowledged thanunknown, because most members of Congress thought they madesense, as did most Americans who knew or thought about them \u2013 and,undoubtedly, most of the journalists who reported them.\nBefore September 11, 2001, the biggest open secret, or \u201covert\ncovert\u201d operation, was U.S. aid to those in Afghanistan who wereresisting Soviet occupation of their country. Former CIA DirectorWilliam Colby characterized the reaction to revelations of Americanassistance to the resistance in Afghanistan as follows: \u201cAfghanistanwas a two-column headline in The Washington Post for one day, then\nalmost nothing.\u201d\n18Americans, in and out of Congress, broadly sup-\nported the cause of the rebels, or mujahideen (often called freedom\n\ufb01ghters at the time, which became a cruel irony on September 11),and the aid was a way to increase the cost of the Soviet occupation.American assistance, reportedly begun in a small way in the last yearof the Carter administration, escalated sharply to reach as much as$500 million a year by the late 1980s.\n19\nThe secret was an open one; the American role was not so much\ncovert as \u2013 by tacit agreement \u2013 unacknowledged. The reason for\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 217\ncircumspection was the delicate position of the Pakistani govern-ment, which was the conduit for the American supplies to the rebels.Pakistan was prepared to support the rebels but was unwilling to betoo visible in doing so lest it antagonize its powerful neighbor, theSoviet Union. In those circumstances, resorting to the CIA rather thanthe American military was more a matter of being discreet than ofkeeping the whole affair secret. The fact that for its own reasons, Pak-istan\u2019s Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI) favored the radical mujahideen\nwas instrumental in the takeover of Afghanistan by the Taliban.\nCertainly, there will be cycles in American attitudes, as there have\nbeen before. In the early 1980s, most Americans evidently sharedtheir president\u2019s concern with the Soviet threat, and their congres-sional representatives went along with huge increases in defensespending \u2013 and in covert action. Ronald Reagan was able to rebuildconsiderable authority and discretion in the American presidency, theIran\u2013Contra debacle notwithstanding. After September 11, GeorgeW. Bush had at least as much of both support and authority in takingon the war against terrorism. Most Americans enthusiastically sup-ported the war in Afghanistan, and they were prepared, initially atleast, to support the Iraq war as a front in the longer \ufb01ght againstterrorism.\nStill, if the changes in American domestic politics since the mid-\n1970s have made it more dif\ufb01cult for the United States to achieveits purposes secretly, other changes make it more dif\ufb01cult now than\nin the 1950s for the United States to intervene successfully at all,covertly or openly. Despite the controversy and mystique that sur-rounded covert action, and to some extent still do, history suggeststhat there is no magic to it. It means providing foreigners, secretly,with money, weapons, or training as tokens of American support.\nWith the passage of time, however, a little money here, a few\nweapons there became less likely to achieve grand foreign-policy pur-poses. Castro was a target of a different order than Arbenz. To thinkin 1975 that a few million dollars might alter the fate of Angola wasa faint hope at best and an illusion at worst, especially given that theCIA recognized that the Soviet Union and other external actors mightcounter American support with more assistance of their own. Eventhe CIA of\ufb01cials who planned the Bay of Pigs knew that to delay theinvasion until Cuba had received deliveries of advanced Soviet \ufb01ghterplanes would be to condemn the plan to certain failure.\n218 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nAlso, there is the contrast between two Central American cases\nthree decades apart: Guatemala and Nicaragua. Castillo Armas\u2019s lib-erators numbered no more than several hundred. Their \u201cinvasion\u201dwas more conjured than real. Yet, they had control of the air, inlarge part because Arbenz, unsure of the loyalty of his air force, wasunwilling to risk putting his own pilots in the air. Sulfatos \u2013 Spanish for\n\u201claxatives,\u201d the name Guatemalans gave to the invaders\u2019 bombs \u2013 plusrumors exaggerating the size of the invasion were enough to induceArbenz to capitulate. In the case of Nicaragua, the Contras numberedabout ten thousand by the mid-1980s, yet not even the most ardent ad-vocates of American assistance to them argued that they were aboutto induce the Sandinistas to \u201csay uncle,\u201d much less that they posed athreat suf\ufb01cient to overthrow the regime by sheer force of arms.\nThe makers of revolutions learned their own lessons from history,\nincluding the history of American covert action. They determinednot to repeat the mistakes of Arbenz and Mossadeq. They sought toassure themselves of the loyalty of the army or to build revolutionarycadres of their own. Before the fall of communism, they also learnedthat if the United States threatened them, there were other sources ofsupport to which they could turn \u2013 and, unlike Arbenz or Mossadeq,they turned to those sources sooner rather than later.\nMoreover, they learned that the United States could be useful as\nan enemy. Arbenz and Mossadeq and even Allende sought Washing-ton\u2019s approval or, at least, its acquiescence. By contrast, if the UnitedStates was of use to Castro, the Sandinistas, and the Ayatollah Ruhol-lah Khomeini, it was primarily as a foreign demon against which theirrevolutions could rally \u2013 even though the Sandinistas were preparedto accept American aid as long as it was forthcoming, and the revo-lutionary Iranians were not above seeking American spare parts fortheir military. In 1979, Iranians took Americans hostage and releasedthem only when they ceased to be useful counters in the bargainingwithin the revolution. Suf\ufb01ce it to say that no one learned the value ofAmerica-as-enemy better than Osama bin Laden.\nvalues and instruments\nIn all likelihood, the record shows, covert operations will become\nknown, and America will be judged for having undertaken them.\nThus, the practical lessons lead into moral issues, which are muted\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 219\nnow by the fearsomeness of the terrorist threat. They are hardlyunique to covert intervention, although they are powerfully presentthere, and they risked \u2013 and may still risk \u2013 being obscured in pol-icy making by the presumption that covert actions will remain secret.Overt interventions \u2013 such as the American invasion of Panama in1989, Afghanistan in 2001, and Iraq in 2003 \u2013 or military attacks \u2013such as the bombing of Libya in 1986 or Sudan and Afghanistan in1998 \u2013 raise similar moral and instrumental concerns. These concernsare not absolute; they must be considered against the gravity of thethreat and the adequacy of other available responses.\nIn December 1976, when I was in Washington working with sev-\neral old friends who were making arrangements for the transitionbetween the Ford NSC and the Carter NSC, we had decided to retainthe basic structure of the Ford administration\u2019s operation, with its net-work of subcabinet committees for particular purposes. Yet, of course,as a new administration, it was necessary to change the names ofthose committees, and so we joked about names. The 40 Committee,the Ford administration\u2019s group for discussing covert action, wouldbecome the \u201cIf They Can Do It, So Can We\u201d Committee.\nYet, the attitude of \u201cif they can do it, so can we\u201d did not seem,\neven then, an unacceptable rationale on either moral or instrumentalgrounds. What the Soviet Union or other nations did could not settlethe issue, neither can how terrorists act. We consider ourselves dif-ferent from them and imagine that the difference is not only basic towhat we are as a people, but also is a source of American in\ufb02uence inthe world, part of this country\u2019s moral armor.\nWe also believe that the example of democracy is powerful, one\ntoward which people all over the world will gravitate if given thechance. Believing that, we must also believe that the example is apowerful part of our external behavior, not only our internal arrange-ments. If people choose democracy when given the chance, thendemocracy is demeaned, perhaps doomed to fail, if it is imposedfrom the outside. There is something incongruous about helping tooverthrow governments \u2013 especially those that come to power throughelections that we would de\ufb01ne as tolerably fair (e.g., Chile in 1970) \u2013in the name of democracy.\nIn this view, some of the \u201csuccesses\u201d of covert action seem ambigu-\nous or transient in retrospect, accomplished at signi\ufb01cant cost to whatwe hold dear as a people and to America\u2019s image in the world.\n220 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nHowever, the world is a nasty, complicated place and the war againstterrorism has driven home that lesson. In that regard, Americans\u2019 his-torical ambivalence between the high moral view and the belief thatinternational politics is a dirty business is understandable.\nTerrorism aside, nations affect one another\u2019s politics in so many\nways that any too-tidy de\ufb01nition of intervention is suspect. In all the\nexamples cited, covert action formed only part of American policy.The United States decided whether to grant economic aid to Cubaor Chile or Angola and whether to release Iranian assets held in theUnited States. Most of those decisions were based on explicitly politi-cal criteria. Even if similar decisions toward other countries are not soexplicitly political, the decisions in any case have political effects onthe country in question; of that fact, foreign political leaders have nodoubt.\nThe same is true of actions by private American actors. U.S.\u2013based\nbusinesses either invest or not in a country, and that decision has notonly an economic effect but also a political effect \u2013 which is the caseeven if the decision is not political in any narrow sense of the term.Most of the businesses or banks that chose not to invest in Chile underAllende probably did not make that choice for any speci\ufb01c politicalreason, despite Washington\u2019s pressure. Rather, it was a business deci-sion based on the climate in Chile. They saw that judgment as an eco-nomic judgment, although political instability surely was a factor intheir decision.\nIn this context, if a unilateral self-denying ordinance against all\nintervention \u2013 open or covert \u2013 seemed too restrictive when the Sovietthreat existed, it surely does now in an age of terror. Some threats toAmerican national security require responses; some American friendsdeserve support. What is imperative is to remember the long-termcosts of intervention for a government that is not notable for attendingto long-term considerations.\nGiven that \u201ccovert\u201d action is not likely to remain secret, why not\nact openly? In the case of aid to the FNLA and the UNITA in Angola,covert rather than overt aid spared the \ufb01rst identi\ufb01cation with theUnited States for only a few months. As for aid to the Contras inNicaragua, the \u201ccovert\u201d form made not one whit of difference becausethe operation quickly became known, and the same was true of aid tothe mujahideen in Afghanistan. Neither is it obvious that in most of\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 221\nthese cases, the recipients of American largesse objected to the sourceof the money being known. There is also the risk that covertness cre-ates a self-ful\ufb01lling prophecy: if the United States aids its friends onlysecretly, then any link to the United States may seem sinister, por-tending more than is the fact.\nThe scope for doing openly what might earlier have been done\ncovertly has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Sovereignty hasbecome less absolute and international law has come to recognizepeople, not just nation-states. In that sense, international law hasmoved in a very \u201cAmerican\u201d direction, even if Americans do notalways like the results (e.g., the creation of the International Crimi-nal Court). However, international practice, if not law, recognizes thatsome behavior by national leaders justi\ufb01es external intervention, evenwith force of arms.\nThe American radio stations broadcasting into Eastern Europe and\nthe Soviet Union from Munich \u2013 Radio Free Europe and Radio Lib-erty \u2013 were in form private organizations; advertisements exhortedAmericans to contribute to them. In fact, they were created and\ufb01nanced covertly by the CIA as propaganda vehicles. When that sup-port was disclosed in 1967, the radio stations nevertheless continuedto operate; they became supervised by a board and supported openlyby appropriations from the U.S. Congress.\nIn the 1980s, the Reagan administration created the National\nEndowment for Democracy (NED), on the model of the (then-West)German party foundations, such as the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung.They are instruments of the major parties but are supported openlyby government money. They have openly assisted kindred parties andlabor movements around the world. The endowment, whose core bud-get reached $40 million in 2003, channels funds to institutes of the twoAmerican political parties as well as an AFL\u2013CIO group and a busi-ness group, which then make grants in support of democratic institu-tions in a number of countries around the world.\n20\nSo far, the record of the NED is mixed but hopeful. Its grants,\nand those of its four constituent institutes, began by being cautiousand close to government policy. It remains an open question, givenAmerican politics, whether public funding is compatible with creativeand, thus, controversial acts by private groups. The original NED bud-get was only an eighth of that of the German-party foundations. Over\n222 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\ntime, Congress has placed various restrictions on the endowment \u2013 forinstance, in 1985, Congress halved the endowment budget and deniedany funding to the Republican and Democratic institutes, althoughthat prohibition was relaxed the next year. It may still be easier forthe CIA to get money from Congress secretly than for another insti-tution to get it openly \u2013 even if the purposes of the two are broadlysimilar. Funding for the CIA remains wrapped in the cloak of nationalsecurity; therefore, members of Congress may be prepared to fundparticular activities but prefer not to be seen voting for them openly.\nStill, the endowment organizations have become more venture-\nsome as the international \u2013 and domestic \u2013 climate has changed. Moreimportant, the endowment now works with scores of kindred orga-nizations, from both other governments and the private sector. Toillustrate the change, in the mid-1980s, the NED provided more than$400,000, over two years, to the American Friends of Afghanistanto develop educational and cultural facilities inside those portions ofthe country controlled by the resistance groups \u2013 activity that mightin other times have been called the \u201ccivic action\u201d component of aparamilitary covert operation.\nIn another example, before Slobodan Milosevic fell from power in\nSerbia in 2000, the NED and other U.S. government sources openlyfunded opposition parties and groups to the tune of $25 million.\n21\nIndeed, the entire operation was almost a carbon copy, done overtly,of what the United States had earlier done covertly (e.g., in Chile).In the case of Serbia, the main difference other than overtness wasthat U.S. government agencies had lots of company from other coun-tries and private NGOs. In other respects, the postmortem could havebeen written by a CIA operative about Chile \u2013 for instance: \u201cFor-eign assistance should focus not only on political parties but shouldcontinue to support a broad range of nongovernmental organizations,labor unions, think tanks, and media.\u201d\nActing openly, however, is not always easy or a complete substi-\ntute for covert action. It requires an explicitness about in\ufb02uencingthe politics of a foreign country that is uncomfortable for Americansand, hence, likely to be controversial. Moreover, governments thatfeel threatened by that open assistance can act to prevent it moreeasily than if it were covert. Yet, even that ability by governmentsis diminishing; national borders aremore porous. Milosevic\u2019s Serbia\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 223\ntried to limit the assistance to opposition organizations. It had somesuccess in keeping out foreign advisors but much less success stop-ping money \ufb02ows and thus ended, somewhat paradoxically, with theworst of outcomes from its perspective: the antigovernment effort waswell funded but more dif\ufb01cult to label with the epithet \u201cforeign in\ufb02u-ence\u201d than if scores of foreign advisors had been present. To quote thepostmortem again: \u201cWhile foreign assistance helped to build and sus-tain the broad anti-Milosevic coalition, indigenous organizations andaction were mainly responsible for driving events.\u201d\nA bias toward openness has it limitations, but surely if it is the right\nlong-term direction for American policy, openness would re\ufb02ect thereality that as the century begins, national boundaries are more andmore permeable. Given this reality, moreover, those groups that theUnited States wants to support may not be so chary of accepting help,even \u2013 perhaps especially \u2013 if it is open. The United States would sayto them, \u201cWe are prepared to support you but only openly. We thinkthat is better for you. In any case, we know it is better for us.\u201d\nchoosing the covert option: lessons from history\nThe history of covert action before September 11 suggests that indeciding whether to choose the covert option, prudent policy makersshould ask themselves a careful series of \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions. Thatinjunction applies to all policies, foreign and domestic. However, itapplies with special force to covert action because of the presumptionof secrecy, at least initially.\nThe most obvious \u201cwhat if?\u201d is \u201cWhat happens if \u2013 or more likely,\nwhen \u2013 it becomes public? What if it becomes public in midstream?\u201dThis is \u201cThe New York Times test.\u201d Large covert actions will not\nremain secret \u2013 a reminder that is easy to state but dif\ufb01cult to embodyin the making of policy when the pressures all go in the direction ofwishful thinking by the policy tribe described in Chapter 7. Witnessthe re\ufb02ections on the Bay of Pigs by Richard Bissell, then-head of theCIA\u2019s clandestine service:\n. . . the argument was [not] made that this is now a very public business, and\nwe\u2019d better treat it as such, and either cancel it if we can\u2019t stand the publicity,or else do some of the things that will increase the chances of success if we aregoing to go forward with it.\n22\n224 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nIf the Iran operation of 1985\u201386 had remained secret for several\nyears after all the hostages had been released, that success mighthave outweighed the costs of being perceived to have traded arms forhostages when the operations became public. Perhaps, but we cannotknow for certain. It did not take, however, a sophisticated analysis toshow that a covert policy targeted on some Iranians was vulnerableto being publicized by opposing Iranian factions if and when it suitedtheir political purposes. It was equally likely that when the cover wasblown, trading arms for hostages with a nation that the United Stateshad denounced as terrorist would be deemed unacceptable by Amer-ica\u2019s allies, much of the rest of the world, and \u2013 most important \u2013 theAmerican people.\nOf course, whether a particular covert operation can bear the test\nof disclosure is apparent in retrospect but often far from obviousbefore the fact. Prudence suggests that presidents pay careful atten-tion to such warning signals as the review process throws out \u2013 theviews of Cabinet of\ufb01cers, people in the White House who attend tothe president\u2019s interests, and congressional overseers who are surro-gates for public reaction.\nOne warning signal, however, is evident in advance: Does the inter-\nvention contradict overt American policy? If it does, as with armssales to Iran, it is especially improbable that the operation will with-stand the test of disclosure. The arms sales were exactly the oppositeof the administration\u2019s public policies, which had coerced America\u2019sallies not to sell arms to Iran, had sought an end to the Iran\u2013Iraq warwith neither a victor nor a vanquished, and had pledged not to bargainwith terrorists over hostages, much less to sell arms to them.\nA second \u201cwhat if?\u201d is \u201cWhat if the \ufb01rst intervention does not suc-\nceed? What then?\u201d If covert action is to remain covert, most of thetime it will have to be small. Small operations often begin with grandpurposes, objectives incommensurate with the instrument. When thegoals could not be achieved, leaders were tempted to take the nextstep and the next. This happened in the Bay of Pigs and Angola andIran in the mid-1980s. Sometimes a limited objective can be achieved,but its achievement makes it appealing to hope for more; witnessAngola and perhaps Nicaragua, where the United States seemed toachieve its initial aim of cutting weapons supplies from Nicaragua tothe antigovernment rebels in El Salvador. Answering this \u201cwhat if?\u201d\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 225\nsuggests, at a minimum, careful attention to the CIA\u2019s covert opera-tors themselves for signs of skepticism about whether operations asinitially conceived can achieve their purposes. Such signs were therebetween the lines of Track II and Angola and Nicaragua. Some risksare worth running, but few are worth running in ignorance.\nA third set of \u201cwhat if?\u201d questions includes \u201cWhat signal will be\nreceived, by whom, and with what result?\u201d \u2013 judgments that are alsoeasier with the bene\ufb01t of hindsight because they involve calculationsof threat and American interests. Intelligence assessments, by the CIAor the State Department, provide one set of indicators. In 1985\u201386,for example, American intelligence on Iran was weak, but what therewas offered precious little ground for believing that there were \u201cmod-erates\u201d who might be detached from their revolutionary colleagues.Later U.S. intelligence cast doubt on the imminence of a Soviet threatto Iran, an original premise of the operation. These were cautions thatthe intended signals might go awry.\nThe nature of those who are to receive secret American assistance\ncan provide another warning signal. Because their relationship to theUnited States is meant to be clandestine, the CIA is often in a weakposition to compel the recipients to act to suit American purposes.Yet, the United States inevitably will become associated with \u201ctheir\u201dactions, like it or not, if and when the fact of support becomes known.Aid to the Contras was dogged by its origins in Somoza\u2019s hatedNational Guard and by continuing charges of human-rights violations.Similarly, support for resistance forces in Afghanistan could havebeen justi\ufb01ed as a way to put strategic pressure on Soviet occupationof that country. However, given the character of the resistance forces,it was hardly a way to bring \u201cdemocracy\u201d to Afghanistan \u2013 far from it.\nThe regional context, particularly the attitude of American frie-\nnds in the region, is another source of guidance. In the case ofAfghanistan, American assistance to the resistance was supported \u2013although with varying degrees of publicity \u2013 by nations ranging fromPakistan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia to China. In Central America, thisindicator was more ambiguous because most of the nations of theregion publicly expressed qualms about the aid to the Contras whileprivately hoping the Sandinistas could be made to go away.\nThe second round of covert action in Angola raised these questions\nof signals given versus those intended, questions for which the 1975\n226 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nepisode provided guidance. In early 1986, the CIA was authorized toprovide $15 million in weaponry to Jonas Savimbi\u2019s UNITA. For theReagan administration, the intended signal was anticommunism. Forthe administration, there was nothing incompatible about supportinganticommunism in Angola and anti-apartheid in South Africa. Alas,the reality of South Africa frustrated that conception in the mindof Washington policy makers. Whatever his attractions, Savimbi hadone \ufb02aw, a fatal one: he was almost completely dependent on SouthAfrica, his army almost a unit of South Africa\u2019s. To support him wasto signal to Africans that the United States was throwing its lot in withSouth Africa in 1986 as in 1975.\nThese rules of thumb amount to establishing a presumption against\ncovert action. The guidance is mostly negative, a series of cautions. Itis unwelcome to of\ufb01cials who are looking for something to do ratherthan something to avoid \u2013 a trait that runs deep in the American char-acter and is reinforced by the circumstances in which covert actionbecomes an option. Yet, given how both America and the world havechanged during the postwar period, the circumstances in which majorcovert action makes sense as policy are sharply limited.\nGuidelines akin to these were articulated in the 1970s by Cyrus\nVance, later secretary of state. For Vance, the criterion for covertaction in the National Security Act of 1947 \u2013 \u201caffecting the nationalsecurity\u201d \u2013 was too loose. Instead, he recommended covert interven-tion only as an exceptional measure, when it was \u201cabsolutely essen-tial to the national security\u201d and when no other means would do.\n23\nDecisions would still be matters of judgment under this more restric-tive guide, but no one has improved on the Vance standard.\ncovert action since september 11\nHow has covert action changed since September 11? How do thosechanges bear on the lessons from earlier operations? Most strik-ing, September 11 dramatically underscored another theme from thereview of earlier covert actions \u2013 the problem of control. The very factthat the interventions are meant to be covert gives rise to special prob-lems of control. The link between U.S. intentions and the actions ofthose foreigners is tenuous at best. They are acting; the United Statesis only helping. \u201cTheir\u201d purposes may not be \u201cours.\u201d They have every\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 227\nincentive to hear from their CIA liaisons what they want to hear orconstrue it to their own purposes. In the details of earlier operations,this meant that covertly supported groups sometimes engaged in alittle unsanctioned drug-dealing or killing along the way or tried tooverturn regimes when the United States thought it was only keepingopposition forces alive.\nIn supporting the anti-Soviet mujahideen in Afghanistan, however,\nthe problem of control was strategic. To minimize the American role,the CIA provided mostly money. Most of the contact in Afghanistanwith the mujahideen was made by Pakistan\u2019s ISI. For its own and\nPakistani reasons, ISI gave preference to the radical Islamists amongthe mujahideen, thus sowing the seeds for the takeover of Pakistan\nby the Taliban and the formation of Al Qaeda as a uni\ufb01ed \ufb01ghtingforce. \u201cTheir\u201d purposes were manifestly not \u201cours.\u201d The two sets ofpurposes converged only as long as both wanted to expel the SovietUnion from Afghanistan.\nIn that sense, the problem of control merges with the more gen-\neral problem of longer term, unintended side effects, a problem thataf\ufb02icts not only foreign policy but also all of human action. In thiscase, however, as in most others, it seems unlikely that any amount ofasking \u201cwhat if?\u201d could have changed the decisions in the 1970s and1980s; the \u201cwhat if?\u201d was simply too iffy. The Soviet Union was therein Afghanistan; getting it out, somehow, was more than U.S. policymakers could hope for at the time. No story about the trail from ISIsupport to the Taliban to Al Qaeda to collapsing towers could havebeen made vivid enough, then, to change the decision.\nThe most that might have been accomplished would have echoed\nDavid Phillips\u2019s comment, quoted earlier in this chapter, aboutGuatemala a half-century earlier: support for the mujahideen did not\nhave to entail that the United States, not to mention the rest ofthe world, would forget about Afghanistan after the Soviet Uniondeparted in 1989. In 1994, while serving in government, I stopped inGeneva en route home from a trying visit to wartime Sarajevo. I didthe rounds of the international relief and humanitarian organizations.The conversations were fascinating in many respects but depressing inthis: we all agreed that times were dire, a breeding ground for extrem-ists, in Afghanistan. Yet, what was true for government policy was alsotrue for their donors of assistance: Afghanistan had been \u201csolved\u201d\n228 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nwith the Soviet withdrawal. The world\u2019s attention had turned else-where and Afghanistan was forgotten.\nA major part of the change in covert action happened before\nSeptember 11, as Serbia illustrated. Given the end of the Cold Warand the changing currents in international law and attitudes, the CIAseems all but out of the business of Chile-style political actions to sus-tain opposition forces or overturn regimes. In 2006, the Bush admin-istration proposed major funding in support of Iranian oppositiongroups; however, it did so openly, through the State Department.There may arise cases in which covert funding seems imperative \u2013 forexample, it is dif\ufb01cult to imagine supporting North Korean oppositionelements at all but surely impossible openly \u2013 but they should be rare.In promoting democracy, or even regime change, the world has trans-formed suf\ufb01ciently to allow the bias toward openness to prevail, alongwith the bias toward company.\nTo that extent, covert action has become \u2013 post\u2013September 11 \u2013\nprimarily paramilitary, with the CIA operating either independentlyor, more often, with military Special Operations Forces. Certainly,the CIA\u2019s performance as the \ufb01rst Americans in Afghanistan wasimpressive.\n24Its operations were secret only in the tactical details\nand thus met The New York Times test. The national investigation\nof September 11 lauded that CIA role and the Afghanistan prece-dent of joint CIA\u2013military teams. It recommended, however, thatthe CIA cede responsibility for directing and executing operationsto the military, with CIA of\ufb01cers and capabilities integrated intomilitary-directed teams, giving both the CIA and the Special Opera-tions Forces the opportunity to do what each does best.\n25The Decem-\nber 2004 intelligence-reform bill was silent on this issue, and the CIAand the military decided that both would remain in the paramilitary-operations business.\nWhich agency is responsible for conducting paramilitary opera-\ntions had been at issue well before September 11, driven by Vietnamand other con\ufb02icts. The arguments for giving the military controlhistorically were those that the 9/11 Commission cited: the requisitecapabilities are military, the task has not been a continuous priorityfor the CIA, and it makes no sense for the nation to build two parallelcapacities. Operations by the military would give those carrying themout the status of combatants under international law, at least if theywere visibly soldiers. On the other side is the concern that the military\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 229\nwas never agile or discreet, much less covert. That concern may havediminished, but it has not disappeared, as the Special OperationsForces developed a wide variety of units and types of operations.\nWhat is notable is the increase in military covert operations and,\nwith it, the challenges to oversight and authorization. During histenure as secretary of defense, a key part of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s driveto reshape the U.S. military into a leaner, more agile force was increas-ing the Pentagon\u2019s Special Operations Forces under the U.S. SpecialOperations Command (SOCOM). By all accounts, the emphasis onspecial operations was only reinforced by Rumsfeld\u2019s frustration thatthe military had to rely on CIA operatives at the beginning of the con-\ufb02ict in Afghanistan in order to establish links to the Northern Alliance\ufb01ghters.\n26Special Operations Forces were to be increased from about\n\ufb01fty thousand at the beginning of 2006 to sixty-four thousand by 2011.(The numbers are less impressive than they look because, of the \ufb01ftythousand, only about a fourth or a \ufb01fth are \u201ctrigger pullers.\u201d Of those,only about two thousand are \u201cblack\u201d \u2013 that is, conducting covert orclandestine operations. By comparison, CIA covert operatives num-ber seven hundred to eight hundred.)\nRumsfeld also shook up SOCOM leadership, seeking more aggres-\nsive action in the war against terrorism, and he converted it from asupporting command (which meant it could only act in support of theregional commands) to a supported command. SOCOM could nowplan and execute its own operations, with the approval of the sec-retary and, if necessary, the president. In May 2004, Rumsfeld suc-ceeded in making SOCOM the lead command in the war against ter-rorism. SOCOM became even more independent in October 2004when Congress, for the \ufb01rst time, granted it the authority to spendmoney to pay informants, recruit foreign \ufb01ghters, and buy weaponryfor them. Until then, only the CIA had such authority, which had ren-dered SOCOM dependent on CIA funding for military operations.\nThe military\u2019s increased independence in covert operations was\nunderscored by revelations in 2006 of military liaison elements(MLEs) \u2013 that is, small detachments of special operators deployedin embassies around the world, including friendly countries.\n27Their\nmission, reportedly, was to gather intelligence and to disrupt, capture,or kill terrorists. According the press accounts, some of the MLEs hadoperated, at least initially, without the knowledge of the U.S. ambas-sador and the country team.\n230 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nBoth CIA and especially SOCOM operations raise thorny ques-\ntions of authorization and accountability. In 2002, CIA operativeskilled \ufb01ve suspected Al Qaeda operatives in Yemen with a Predator\nmissile \ufb01red from a UAV. One of the \ufb01ve killed was an American cit-izen.\n28This was only the \ufb01rst of a series of similar CIA attacks along\nthe border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nCIA covert operations require a presidential \ufb01nding, one trans-\nferred in secret to the relevant committees of Congress.29Existing\n\ufb01ndings apparently provided authorization for the CIA to conductboth Predator attacks. The term \ufb01nding comes from the Hughes Ryan\nAct of 1974, which required the president to \u201c\ufb01nd\u201d a particular oper-ation necessary to U.S. national security. Turned into a noun, thatbecame a \u201c\ufb01nding\u201d delivered in secret to Congress. After the Iran\u2013Contra Affair of the 1980s, Congress tightened the rules for covertaction in several ways in the 1991 Intelligence Authorization Act.\n30\nFindings are to be transmitted to the relevant committees as soon aspossible after they are signed and, in any event, before the operationbegins. Only \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d can alter that require-ment; then, the committees are to be informed \u201cin a timely fashion\u201d \u2013a phrase that re\ufb02ected artful dodging after a long argument over spe-ci\ufb01c periods.\nMoreover, after the involvement of NSC staffers in the Iran\u2013\nContra Affair, Congress extended the \ufb01nding process to \u201cany depart-ment, agency, or entity of the United States Government.\u201d Gone wasthe presumption that only the CIA would conduct covert actions, andCongress expressed its determination to oversee them no matter whoconducted them.\nBy contrast, an operation similar to the Predator attacks conducted\nby the military Special Operations Forces could be set in motionsimply by the chain of command from the president as commanderin chief. The 1991 Act created what turned out to be a loophole byexempting from the de\ufb01nition of covert action \u201ctraditional militaryactivities or routine support to such activities.\u201d The Act did not de\ufb01newhat traditional meant; however, the committee report indicated that\nit meant what is usually called \u201cpreparing the battle space\u201d \u2013 thatis, actions before and related to anticipated hostilities involving U.S.troops or when hostilities are underway, whether or not the actionsare public.\n31Anticipate was interpreted in the report to mean that\noperational planning had already been approved.\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 231\nBy contrast, in the war against terrorism, the Pentagon and the\nBush administration interpreted \u201ctraditional military activities\u201d toinclude those years ahead of any hostilities and even away from whereactual \ufb01ghting can be imagined in continuous military operations todevelop the situation in which the United States can attack global ter-rorist organizations. As a result, if the Pentagon conducts an unac-knowledged operation in a country where U.S. troops are not present,how can the administration prove that it is in anticipation of lateinvolvement by regular military units and not a covert action for whicha \ufb01nding is required?\nMore to the point, who will make the administration prove it?\nAs with other covert actions, the intelligence committees cannot askabout operations of which they are unaware. They cannot ask if theoperation fails because, for congressional overseers, they are in Rums-feld\u2019s category of \u201cunknown unknowns.\u201d Moreover, even if Congressknows about an operation, its oversight is a three-way tug of war, onethat continues to rage. The House and Senate intelligence commit-tees are responsible for the intelligence-authorization bills, but thosebills go to the armed-services committees before being passed to thefull chambers. Real control of the purse strings rests with the defensesubcommittees of the appropriations committees. As the negotiationover the 2004 intelligence-reform bill showed, those responsible fordefense on the Hill are not eager to invite their intelligence-committeecolleagues to hunt in their domain.\nUnfortunately, the difference between the processes for CIA and\nSOCOM covert operations ultimately may be less than meets the eye.If \ufb01ndings in the war against terrorism have become so broad as tocover almost any CIA operation \u2013 including those direct Predator\nattacks on suspected terrorists \u2013 whether the CIA or the military con-ducts them seems to matter little. If this is true, however, the problemlies with the breadth of the \ufb01ndings \u2013 if they are so broad as to coveralmost anything, then the \ufb01nding process has become a sham.\ncovert action and open democracy\nThe United States will remain in the business of covert action andthus will continue to confront the paradox of secret operations in ademocracy, even if those operations are mostly paramilitary and coun-terterrorist in character. However, similar issues will be even sharper\n232 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nat home, as the age of terror requires more intelligence-gatheringon inhabitants of the United States; that paradox is at the heart ofChapter 9.\nUnfortunately, the process of congressional oversight of intelli-\ngence, including covert action, so carefully crafted in the 1970s, isnow regarded as something of a joke in Washington. Terrorism isfrightening enough to the body politic to justify almost any action inresponse: the controversy in 2006 over eavesdropping on Americansby the NSA in the wake of September 11 emphasized the \u201calmost,\u201dand the eventual outcome in 2007, in which congressional Democratsall but caved in before the administration returned the emphasis to\u201cany.\u201d The House and Senate oversight committees have not escapedthe bitter partisanship that has come to af\ufb02ict Congress as a wholeand, for various reasons, the stature of the committee members hasdeclined, although with several outstanding exceptions.\nThe 9/11 Commission suggested that if a single DNI is to oversee\nthe entire intelligence community \u2013 as well as preside over fundingfor all of it \u2013 Congress also should concentrate its oversight. Accord-ingly, the Commission called on Congress to renew its commitmentsfrom the 1970s, having either a single joint committee to oversee intel-ligence (on the model of the old Joint Atomic Energy Committee) orsingle committees in each house. Like the House homeland-securitycommittee after them, the intelligence committees were never giventhe monopoly that was intended at their creation and, through theyears, even more committees have become involved.\nThe 9/11 Commission also sought to revamp ideas from the 1970s\nagreements in several other ways. To represent other committeeswith interests in the \ufb01eld, the new oversight committee or committeeswould revert to the practice of having a member who also serves oneach of the following committees or subcommittees: Armed Services,Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and Defense Appropriations. To promotecontinuity and expertise, oversight-committee members should serveinde\ufb01nitely on the new intelligence committees. The new committeesshould be smaller \u2013 perhaps seven or nine members in each house \u2013 sothat each member feels a greater sense of responsibility and account-ability for the quality of the committee\u2019s work.\nHere, too, the arguments are long-standing, going back to the\ncongressional investigations of the 1970s. However, changing times\nCovert Action: Forward to the Past? 233\nreshuf\ufb02e the arguments. Surely, having real focal points is the rightidea. The objective was identical in the 1970s; however, it was neverfully achieved and has eroded since then as more committees havegotten into the act. In those days, the model favored by the 9/11 Com-mission \u2013 a single committee for both houses on the Atomic EnergyCommittee model \u2013 was not in favor because that committee wasregarded as having become the captive of the agency it oversaw. Thefear that permanent committee members might become \u201ctoo cozy\u201dwith the agencies they oversaw also led Congress in the 1970s to givethe intelligence committees rotating memberships.\nNow, however, those memories are distant and the need for focal\npoints is more intense. To try to achieve those focal points, the 9/11Commission also favored the 1970s practice of appointing membersfrom other committees with stakes in intelligence to the oversightcommittees. By 2004, when the Commission reported, the need forexperience on the oversight committees outweighed concerns aboutcooption; thus, the Commission favored open-ended (not rotating)assignments to the committee or committees. However, these are justdetails; the real challenge for Congress is to not lag too far behind theexecutive branch in its own reshaping for the intelligence challengesof the twenty-\ufb01rst century.\nThe Iran\u2013Contra Affair two decades earlier showed how dif\ufb01cult\nit can be to manage the paradox of secret operations in an opensociety. When President Reagan \ufb01nally signed the \ufb01nding in January1986 for the Iran arms-sales operation, that \ufb01nding was explicit: donot tell Congress. The congressional overseers did not \ufb01nd out aboutthe operation until autumn \u2013 hardly the law\u2019s requirement of \u201cfullyand currently informed\u201d by anyone\u2019s de\ufb01nition. Later, the presidenthimself apparently was not told when the Iran and Contra operationscrossed, with proceeds from the arms sales to Iran being used to fundthe Contras without congressional appropriation.\nIn another sense, however, the system worked. In deciding to sell\narms to Iran, the president pursued a line of policy opposed by bothhis secretaries of state and defense, about which he was afraid toinform the congressional intelligence committees and which was liableto be revealed by Iranian factions as and when it suited them. It is dif-\ufb01cult to imagine any system providing more warning signals. Whenmost of the government\u2019s senior foreign-policy of\ufb01cials are opposed,\n234 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nit is likely that the policy, not them, is wrong. The president thus pro-ceeded at his own peril.\nConcerning the diversion of money for the Contras, the lesson is a\ncaution for presidents and those who advise them: do not run covertoperations from the White House. Before the 1970s, it would havebeen unthinkable for an administration to do so; at that time, the rea-son was that presidents wanted to stay at arms\u2019 length from such oper-ations, even if they could not plausibly deny them in a pinch. Now,however, if covert actions are to be undertaken, they should be doneby the agency of government constructed to carry them out \u2013 the CIA,which has both the expertise and the accountability.\nMoreover, the history of covert action suggests that if the presi-\ndent\u2019s closest advisors become the operators, then the president losesthem as sources of detached judgment on the operations. The presi-dent\u2019s own circle becomes advocates, as Allen Dulles did in the Bayof Pigs, rather than protectors of the president\u2019s stakes (even if heor she does not quite realize the need for protection). So it was withPresident Reagan\u2019s national security advisors, Robert McFarlane andJohn Poindexter; once committed, they had reason to overlook thewarning signals thrown out by the process. Excluding the designatedcongressional overseers also excluded one more \u201cpolitical scrub,\u201d onemore source of advice about what the American people would \ufb01ndacceptable. Thus, the chances increased that someone like LieutenantColonel Oliver North would misguidedly interpret the president\u2019sinterest after his own fashion.\nWilliam Miller, the staff director of the \ufb01rst Senate Intelligence\nCommittee, re\ufb02ected as follows on the Iran\u2013Contra Affair: \u201cIf clearlines hadn\u2019t been drawn a decade ago, there would have been no hueand cry now.\u201d\n32Now is the time to both remember those lines and\ndraw them again, even more so as the boundary between covert actionand military special operations blurs.\n9\nRebuilding the Social Contract1\nThe Church Committee stated it well three decades ago: \u201cThe UnitedStates must not adapt the tactics of its enemies. Means are as impor-tant as ends. Crisis makes it tempting to ignore the wise restraints thatmake men free. But each time we do so, each time the means we useare wrong, our inner strength, the strength which makes us free, islessened.\u201d\n2\nBecause intelligence agencies operate in secret and because they\nengage in activities that are sensitive or even illegal at home, theydepend on public trust. I \ufb01rst came to know intelligence in the 1970sthrough the Church Committee when that trust had been broken. Thesocial contract had been broken then by revelations about excesses,both foreign and domestic \u2013 ranging from assassination plots againstforeign leaders, to the covert CIA role in Chile and other countries, toillegal spying on Americans. Poignantly for me as a young person, thetrust had been broken not only with the public at large but also withsome of my then-young counterparts who worked in the intelligenceagencies. More than once when I was riding the famous Blue Birdbuses from CIA headquarters to downtown Washington, I had occa-sion to chat with young CIA of\ufb01cers who expressed their disappoint-ment verging on disillusion: \u201cThey told me when I joined that the CIAdidn\u2019t engage in assassinations, and now I found out that it did.\u201d\nThe social contract between the public and intelligence had been\nbroken. In that contract, the American people said, in effect, \u201cWecannot know about much of what you do, but we will give you licenseto act in our name, even to take illegal or unsavory actions, but wecount on you to understand the limits imposed by our values.\u201d For\n235\n236 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\na long time after 1976, the mere mention that I had worked for theChurch Committee would elicit hisses from intelligence audiences but,over time, intelligence professionals also realized that the Commit-tee\u2019s work was an essential part of rebuilding the social contract. Atthe time, our colleagues in the government, then-DCI William Colbyforemost among them, understood that fact even if they did not alwayslike it or the airing of intelligence\u2019s dirty linen that it required of them.As we sought to fashion oversight arrangements, the emphasis was ondevising ways \u2013 like the \ufb01nding process discussed in Chapter 8 \u2013 thatwould be surrogates for what the American people would accept ifthey could know what actions were contemplated in their name.\nNow, the contract is broken again, in a combination of intelligence\nfailures and epithets. Even if the failures, like that of September 11,ensued for understandable reasons, they were still failures. Even ifthe epithets, like Abu Ghraib or waterboarding, are at the margins ofintelligence proper, they still cast a dark shadow over it. The outragesat Abu Ghraib were committed by military-intelligence of\ufb01cers, and ifinterrogation was but a small part of Cold War strategic intelligence, italways has been a key element of police work and will continue to beimportant to intelligence in an age of terror, both at home and abroad.Intelligence has been deemed incompetent and worse. The contract isbroken again.\nAt the same time and partly in result, intelligence in democracies\nis becoming more the subject of political debate. The change in intel-ligence\u2019s targets and the consequent need to expand surveillance athome is driving that debate as it stretches democratic oversight ofintelligence \u2013 as the controversies over the boundaries of SIGINTin countries from the United States to Sweden testify. For oversight,too, the Cold War\u2019s solutions may no longer suf\ufb01ce. After the inves-tigations of the 1970s, the U.S. Congress passed the FISA to providesome judicial oversight of domestic surveillance for national-security \u2013as opposed to law enforcement \u2013 purposes. A secret court reviewedapplications from the Justice Department and the FBI. After Septem-ber 11, however, the administration argued, it could not target namedindividuals with speci\ufb01c warrants before the fact; rather, it neededto scan wide swathes of communication, searching for connectionsof interest. It may be that oversight will have to move from judicial\nRebuilding the Social Contract 237\napproval before the fact to some form of continuing legal or congres-sional review as surveillance proceeds.\nThe change in intelligence\u2019s targets also raises ethical issues, ones\nthat slide into prudential questions in a democracy. These also are illu-minated by some comparative perspective, suggesting how differentpractices and experiences are re\ufb02ections of the different national waysof dealing with intelligence, which in turn re\ufb02ect different political cul-tures with different relationships between governments and peopleand different ways of de\ufb01ning power. In Europe, for instance, Britainand France still perceive themselves as global powers and are quitedifferent from countries like Germany and the Netherlands, whichdo not.\nThe campaign against terrorism not only is mixing military force\nand intelligence in new ways, it is also straining the limits of both \u2013from the limits of preemption to the use of covert action away fromthe battle\ufb01eld. Intelligence is expanding dramatically in both expenseand breadth of activity, some of which is controversial. At the sametime that intelligence is seeking and being given new powers, technol-ogy is providing new opportunities to survey large quantities of infor-mation about individuals. The irony is that intelligence will be moreeffective the less terrorists understand of its scope and methods \u2013which constrains the scope of the public debate.\n3\nthe epithets of intelligence\nA con\ufb02uence of revelations created the epithets, putting torture andthe treatment of detainees at center stage, and cast a long shadow overthe effort to reshape intelligence. The events included the revelationof mistreatment of prisoners, including by military intelligence, at AbuGhraib prison outside Baghdad; the revelations of a network of so-called black sites \u2013 covert prisons for suspected terrorists run by theCIA in Eastern Europe; the continuing debate about the prisons atGuantanamo Bay \u2013 how prisoners there were treated and how theywill be dealt with; and the controversy over whether waterboarding istorture, including a leaked classi\ufb01ed report by the CIA\u2019s IG providingevidence that interrogation techniques approved by the White Housemight have violated international conventions against torture.\n4\n238 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nEven before September 11, there were charges that the United\nStates engaged in \u201crenditions\u201d \u2013 that is, the transferring of prisonersnot to the United States for trial but rather to countries that may en-gage in torture. After September 11, the most widely known examplewas the case of a Canadian citizen, Maher Arar, apprehended by U.S.of\ufb01cials while transiting New York for having alleged connections toAl Qaeda and deported via Jordan to Syria (his birth country), wherehe was imprisoned and allegedly tortured. In 2007, the Canadian (butnot the American) government cleared him of any connection to ter-rorism, apologized, and awarded him a $10.5 million settlement.\nBush administration of\ufb01cials argued that the government neither\nadvocated nor ordered the use of torture, but they also argued thatmembers of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other suspected terroristgroups do not qualify as lawful \u201cenemy combatants\u201d and therefore donot have rights under the Geneva Conventions (i.e., the internation-ally accepted rules on conduct during wartime that govern the treat-ment of detainees). By this logic, terrorists do not enjoy legal protec-tions because they do not follow any rules of war: they \ufb01ght for nonation-state, they target innocents, they wear no insignia, and theydisguise themselves as civilians. Nonetheless, the Bush administrationpledged that the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay was con-sistent with the Geneva Conventions.\nFor Senator John McCain (R-AZ), who was tortured during his\ntime as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, waterboarding \u2013 de\ufb01ned asstrapping a detainee down and then pouring water on his nose to makehim believe he is drowning \u2013 was \u201ctorture, no different than holdinga pistol to his head and \ufb01ring a blank.\u201d McCain proposed an amend-ment outlawing all forms of \u201ccruel, inhuman, or degrading treatmentor punishment\u201d for U.S.\u2013held detainees. The bill became the De-tainee Treatment Act (DTA) of 2005, attached to the defense appro-priations act.\n5The amendment limited interrogation techniques to\nthose in Army Field Manual, 34\u201352 Intelligence Interrogation. Theeffect of the amendment was attenuated by simultaneous congres-sional actions that blocked Guantanamo prisoners from \ufb01ling newpetitions of habeas corpus, although they were granted limited appealrights to the Court of Appeals in Washington.\n6Another legislative\nattempt to limit the CIA (and other agencies) to the interrogation\nRebuilding the Social Contract 239\npractices of the military as described in the Army Field Manual wasvetoed by President Bush in early 2008.\nSecret prisons established in the immediate aftermath of Septem-\nber 11, 2001, were used to house \u201chigh-level\u201d detainees. The existenceof these CIA-run detention centers was \ufb01rst reported in November2005.\n7The exact locations remain secret, although news reports sug-\ngest that they were in Romania and Poland. Similar camps in Afgha-nistan and Thailand were closed down. There were perhaps thirtydetainees in the camps who were considered major terrorist suspects \u2013several of whom later were transferred to Guantanamo Bay \u2013 whileseventy \u201cless important\u201d detainees were reportedly sent to Egypt,Morocco, and other Muslim nations. The camps were establishedunder a sweeping order signed by President Bush, in light of Con-gress\u2019s passage, one week after September 11, 2001, of the Authoriza-tion for Use of Military Force (AUMF). The authorization grantedthe president broad authority to use all necessary force \u201cagainst thosenations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized,committed, or aided the [9/11] terrorist attacks\u201d; this included, admin-istration of\ufb01cials argued, the powers to secretly gather intelligence onAl Qaeda and associated groups as well as the authority to kill, cap-ture, or imprison suspected members of Al Qaeda.\n8\nIn June 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the military com-\nmission established by the Bush administration to try detainees atGuantanamo Bay lacked \u201cthe power to proceed because its structuresand procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justiceand the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.\u201d\n9The defendant\nwas Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a native of Yemen and former driver forOsama bin Laden, who was captured during the 2001 war in Afgha-nistan; held in Guantanamo Bay after 2002; and charged with conspir-acy, murder, and acts of terrorism. The defense argued that militarytribunals fail to give defendants a free and fair trial, a universally rec-ognized right that falls under customary international law (which isbinding and carries nearly the same jurisdiction as codi\ufb01ed, or treaty,law).\nIn contrast, the Bush administration argued that Congress granted\nthe president, as commander in chief, direct AUMF, which allowsfor the creation of military courts. The administration subsequently\n240 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nadjusted the procedures for the military tribunals; however, it was \u2013 interms of international opinion, at any rate \u2013 too little, too late.\nThe simplest way to end the epithets and their overhang for intel-\nligence is to end the practices that give rise to them. The CIA statedthat it stopped using waterboarding in 2003.\n10According to DNI Mike\nMcConnell, the CIA used \u201cspecial methods of questioning\u201d on aboutthirty people.\n11Rather than vetoes, an administration could start by\nstating that the United States does not engage in torture, includingwaterboarding, and that no techniques other than those outlined inthe Army Field Manual will be employed. The administration mightunderscore its seriousness by seeking, not shunning, congressionalaction in support of that view. For me, it is not a close call: even if itwas waterboarding that eventually broke several high-value detaineeslike Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, and AbuZubaida, the price was too high. The con\ufb02ict with Islamic extremistterrorists is ultimately a war of ideas, and we lose the war if we stoopto their methods. On that score, the Church Committee got it right ageneration ago.\nMoreover, what we Americans hear in these episodes is not what is\nperceived abroad. We as Americans are conscious of the checks andbalances in our system. If an Abu Ghraib happens, the nation will getto the bottom of it, and those responsible will be punished. If the CIAgoes too far, it will be restrained. The trouble is that the rest of theworld sees only the images of Abu Ghraib or hears the word torture .\nFor them, that is the end of the story, not the beginning of a compli-cated process of investigation and correction in our system. It is theimage or the epithet that lasts, not the quali\ufb01cations or remediation.\nFor those reasons, Guantanamo was an \u201copen sore\u201d for the nation,\nincluding its intelligence agencies. Its existence was a visible counterto all for which we said we stood. Yet, it was not an easy problem tosolve. International law permits detaining potential combatants dur-ing war, but the wars contemplated by that were limited in time. Thus,can potential combatants at Guantanamo Bay be held without trialforever? Surely, the answer must be no, but then what? Legal scholars\nhave and will continue to spew megabytes on the subject, but suf\ufb01ceit to say that most of the current detainees could not be tried in eitherU.S. courts or military tribunals \u2013 about three quarters of the approx-imately 350 detainees being held as of late 2007.\nRebuilding the Social Contract 241\nThe practical problems of trying the detainees are daunting be-\ncause most of their actions were committed in far-off lands, witnessesare dead or have disappeared, and so on. However, it is the jurisdic-tional problem that is the showstopper because many of the acts werenot crimes when and where they were committed. Simply sending thedetainees home is dif\ufb01cult \u2013 as the years since September 11 haveshown \u2013 because in many cases, their ostensible \u201chome countries\u201d donot want them. About a \ufb01fth of the detainees in 2007 had been clearedfor release but there was no country willing to take them.\nThe place to start rectifying Guantanamo as an epithet would be\nfor an administration to announce that the prison would be closed,which might put pressure on foreign countries to agree to take someof the detainees \u2013 it surely would put pressure on U.S. institutions to\ufb01nd ways of dealing with them. For the few detainees that still mightbe considered dangerous, procedures for preventive detention mightbe \ufb02eshed out to offer legal protection.\nThe \u201cGuantanamo problem\u201d should arise less frequently in the\nfuture, when detainees will fall into one of three categories. Thosearrested here, especially in homegrown plots such as in Fort Dix, willbe candidates for criminal trials \u2013 however messy or unsatisfying thosetrials may be. Those arrested in Europe or other industrial countriesbut accused of plotting against the United States will be tried wherethey are caught \u2013 now that the jurisdictions of virtually all industrialcountries include terrorism-related offenses \u2013 or perhaps they will beextradited to the United States for trial. It is only those who might becaptured in or rendered from hostile or ungoverned spaces that willinvoke the Guantanamo challenges of procedure and jurisdiction.\nthe impact of september 11\nIn setting the epithets in some context, it is worth pausing over thehistory since September 11 because the nation is still very much inthe middle of the process of striking anew the balance between lib-erty and security. In the phrase of one observer, the war on terrorismput \u201ctwo vital, deeply grounded principles of American governmenton a collision course.\u201d On the one hand, the president has an unques-tioned responsibility to protect the nation against foreign attacks andto prevent hostile foreign powers from conducting covert intelligence\n242 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nactivities within our borders. On the other hand, law enforcementpower, always potentially dangerous to a free society, may operateonly within boundaries established by the Bill of Rights.\n12On that\nvery argument, the nation established the \u201cdistinctions\u201d \u2013 betweenlaw enforcement and intelligence and between foreign and domestic \u2013that made sense during the latter years of the Cold War but set up thenation to fail on September 11, 2001.\nYet, it is worth remembering that for most people, the liberty in\nquestion is speci\ufb01c \u2013 that is, privacy \u2013 not the more general sense. AsRichard Betts stated:\nThe most legitimate trade-off is not between security and liberty in general,but between security and privacy, the one aspect of liberty that inhibits thegovernment\u2019s acquisition of information. There is no need to compromisethe more important elements of civil liberties having to do with freedom ofspeech, political organization, religion, or especially the right to due processo fl a w ....\n13\nThe reminder is important because so much of the debate afterSeptember 11 was conducted in the sweeping \u201cliberty or security\u201dterms. It is true that a wider swath of civil liberties was affected imme-diately after September 11, and some of those events framed the epi-thets that now surround intelligence, which range from constitutionalto administrative.\n14\nConstitutional\nAmerican constitutional law distinguishes sharply between \u201cU.S. per-sons\u201d \u2013 that is, U.S. citizens and resident aliens \u2013 and \u201cothers\u201d; there-fore, most attention is focused on U.S. citizens. Nonetheless, the largenumbers of noncitizens affected, especially in the immediate after-math of the war in Afghanistan, raised concerns those rose almost tothe level of being \u201cconstitutional\u201d:\nrDetaining foreign nationals in the United States . In the immediate\naftermath of the 9/11 attack, 1,200 foreign nationals living in theUnited States were arrested and detained in considerable secrecy;460 were still in detention in January 2002, their identities andlocations undisclosed. Only ninety-three who were charged with a\nRebuilding the Social Contract 243\ncrime were ever identi\ufb01ed. The Justice Department\u2019s own internalreport, released in June 2003, was critical of the process: bureau-cratic inertia left a number of innocent people languishing in jailsfor months while systematic understaf\ufb01ng left them with littlechance to prove their innocence. Often, no distinction was madebetween serious suspects and immigrants who had no connection tosuspect groups.\n15\nrDetaining foreign nationals in Guantanamo. Guantanamo becamean epithet, and it was controversial from the beginning. At the startof 2004, 650 foreigners who had been captured in Afghanistan werestill being held at the U.S. prison camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.While the detaining of foreigners in the United States declined invisibility as they were released, deported, or charged, the Guan-tanamo prisoners were a continuing embarrassment at least and aforeign-policy nightmare at worst. Overall, 775 detainees had beenbrought to Guantanamo by 2007, with more than 400 released.\nrDetaining and con\ufb01ning American citizens without judicial reviewand restricting access to counsel. This small subset of the detentionswas of particular concern because of citizenship. One detainee,Yasser Esam Hamdi, had left the United States with his Saudi par-ents when he was less than a year old and thus may have lost hisAmerican citizenship; however, the citizenship of the other, Abdul-lah al Muhajir (born Jos \u00b4e Padilla) was undisputed. When Padilla\nwas transferred to military detention, one of the justi\ufb01cations fordoing so was to prevent him from communicating with his lawyerlest he advance terrorist activity. However, in 2006, he was trans-ferred to a jail in Miami, tried in federal court, and found guiltyof conspiring to kill people in an overseas jihad and funding and\nsupporting overseas terrorism. In January 2008, he was sentencedto 208 months in prison. In 2004, Hamdi was stripped of his U.S.citizenship and released to Saudi Arabia.\nrRetaining names of U.S. persons in databases and on watch lists .\nAs the U.S. government tried to do better by way of keeping tabson potential terrorists, of\ufb01cials in several agencies reported con-cern that under the pressure of acting, they are randomly collectingnames of U.S. persons. So far, the government has not providedmuch guidance to those agencies in dealing with them \u2013 a concern\n244 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nechoed by a Markle Foundation task force.16If a U.S. person has\nbeen implicated as a suspected terrorist in an FBI investigation,he or she can be included in, for example, a database. However,what if the FBI investigation is only preliminary? Should there berestrictions on how widely the U.S. person\u2019s inclusion is shared?These issues, and many others, still remain to be settled.\nrEnhancing surveillance by expanding the FISA . Here, the issues\nturned out to be two. The \ufb01rst issue discussed immediately afterSeptember 11 was the Patriot Act, which widened the scope fornational-security eavesdropping. It was only years later when thenation learned that the administration had also authorized afterSeptember 11 a second NSA eavesdropping program, called by theadministration the TSP, with no court authorization whatsoever.This section discusses the Patriot Act expansion; a subsequent sec-tion describes the controversy over the second NSA program inmore detail.Modern presidents had claimed, but the courts had called into\nquestion, warrantless searches for national-security \u2013 as opposed tolaw enforcement \u2013 purposes. The FISA was a compromise, establish-ing a special secret court to review applications for national-securitysearch and wiretaps of both citizens and noncitizens. The Patriot Act,passed in the immediate aftermath of September 11, widened thescope for the FISA warrants.\n17\nThe FISA and its court, the FISC, had been the preeminent tools\nthat the FBI and other federal agents used for pursuing the waragainst terrorism in the absence of probable cause that a crime has\nbeen committed. They or something like them probably are necessarybecause by the time terrorists commit a crime, it is too late. Ideally, theUnited States would prevent all terrorist acts and there would neverbe a crime to prosecute. By contrast, criminals such as drug traf\ufb01ckerscommit a stream of crimes; thus, if they are well into that stream bythe time authorities are able to apprehend and prosecute them, it is ashame but not a catastrophe.\nIn any case, the handling of the Moussaoui case spurred action to\nloosen the FISA, which the Patriot Act put into effect. Some of theAct\u2019s provisions simply corrected oversights in statutory language or\nRebuilding the Social Contract 245\nupdated the law to match new technology. For instance, FISA wire-taps were designed for an era of analog telephones; the Patriot Actauthorized the use of \u201croving\u201d or \u201cmultipoint\u201d wiretaps, which allowmonitoring of all devices that a suspect might use \u2013 a long-standingpractice in criminal investigations.\nOther parts of the Patriot Act were more controversial. FISA wire-\ntaps always were permitted to be longer than law enforcement coun-terparts \u2013 90 days versus 30 \u2013 with extensions easier to obtain. ThePatriot Act extended them further, to 120 days, and it doubled from45 to 90 days the period in which foreign agents, including U.S. citi-zens, could be subject to clandestine physical searches.\nPerhaps of greater concern, the Act made an apparently small\nchange that it was feared would have signi\ufb01cant consequences. BeforeSeptember 11, obtaining foreign-intelligence information had to be\u201cthe purpose\u201d of FISA surveillance.\n18If evidence of a crime was un-\ncovered in the course of the wiretap, that evidence was admissiblein court, but the foreign-intelligence purpose was paramount. ThePatriot Act loosened the requirement to \u201c a signi\ufb01cant purpose.\u201d\n19\nBecause FISA wiretaps do not require probable cause of a crime andare longer, more \ufb02exible, and less controlled by judges than lawenforcement wiretaps, there was and is concern that FISA wiretapswill be used to troll for law enforcement purposes.\nThe expansion of the FISA also led to tensions between the FBI\nand the FISC about who can approve the sharing of FISA datawith FBI law enforcement agents. However, in November 2002, afederal-court ruling upheld more sharing of intelligence across theintelligence\u2013law enforcement divide within the Bureau and, in Octo-ber 2003, new guidelines were distributed to the FBI \ufb01eld of\ufb01ces con-\ufb01rming the change.\n20Before the Patriot Act, the Bureau would have\nhad to open separate wiretaps \u2013 a criminal one based on a court orderand a FISA one for intelligence purposes \u2013 and would have beensharply constrained in sharing information between the two. Underthe new guidelines, it could open, for example, a single FISA surveil-lance looking at whether a suspect was part of a terrorist organiza-tion (an intelligence purpose) and whether the suspect planned to buyexplosives (a law enforcement purpose). Agents working on the twoaspects of the case could cooperate closely.\n246 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nLegislative\nBecause surveillance has the potential to touch the privacy if not thelives of so many Americans, it is the core concern \u2013 even if those con-cerns do not always reach the constitutional:\nrMonitoring the source and destination of e-mail and Internet traf\ufb01c.These so-called pen and trap-and-trace techniques were previouslylimited to telephones but were extended by the Patriot Act. Theydo not record content but can be put in place by a court order shortof showing relevance to an investigation. They are not consideredsearches under the Fourth Amendment, the U.S. Supreme Courthaving ruled that people have no expectation of privacy about theirtelephone numbers, which are used by telephone companies forbilling.\nHowever, intercepted e-mail also contains a subject line, thus blurringthe line between \u201ccommunications attributes\u201d and content. Content is\nprotected and requires a warrant. The concern is even greater becausethe technology for e-mails \u2013 unlike telephone calls \u2013 also has the abil-ity to intercept the entire message.\nrExpanding clandestine searches . The Patriot Act also extended the\nscope of these \u201csneak-and-peak\u201d searches, which have little to dowith terrorism because the FISA confers much broader powers.\nrEnlarging access to transaction information in national-securityinvestigations from communications providers, \ufb01nancial institutions,and credit agencies. Before September 11, the FBI was permittedto issue National Security Letters (NSLs), seeking bank-accountinformation without the holders\u2019 knowledge and without a courtorder. The Patriot Act expanded that access beyond banks andloosened the criterion to any foreign-intelligence or counterterror-ism purpose.\n21Before September 11, the letter of request had to\ncertify that the information was for foreign-intelligence purposesand that there were facts proving that the targeted customer was aforeign agent. Under the Patriot Act, it became suf\ufb01cient that therequest had a foreign-intelligence or counterterrorism purpose.\n22\nA parallel change opened access to telephone records on the samebasis\n23; another change opened up access to educational records on\nroughly the same basis.24\nRebuilding the Social Contract 247\nAdministrative\nSome of the issues of concern re\ufb02ected neither constitutional nor leg-islative provisions but rather administrative guidelines. In particular,Attorney General John Ashcroft relaxed guidelines issued by his pre-decessors, especially Edward Levy in 1976 and Benjamin Civiletti in1980, as follows:\nrAllowing more discretion to of\ufb01cers in the \ufb01eld. Here, Moussaoui isthe celebrated case and argument for more discretion in the \ufb01eld.However, critics see the shadows of COINTELPRO in the prospectof giving yet more discretion to \ufb01eld of\ufb01cers who already have agreat deal. On May 30, 2002, the attorney general relaxed the pre-vailing guidelines to permit FBI agents to search the Web, mineopen data, and attend public meetings, including those of politicaland religious groups.\n25\nr\u201cConnecting the dots\u201d about individuals. Here, the cause c \u00b4el`ebre\nwas the Pentagon\u2019s program for Total (later Terrorism) Informa-tion Awareness (TIA). It was a public-relations nightmare, seenby much of the public as \u201cBig Brother\u201d while still in its infancy. Itsdirector, John Poindexter, was a lightning rod for critics because hehad been convicted (later reversed on appeal) for lying to Congressduring the Iran\u2013Contra Affair of the 1980s. A research project, notan operation, it built on previous arti\ufb01cial intelligence and data-mining research sponsored by the DARPA.\n26It was to use mod-\nern computer power to scan public and private databases againsttemplates of terrorist-attack scenarios.\n27More fundamentally, new\ntechnology and process raise fundamental questions about whatconstitutes a \u201csearch\u201d if that process can assemble a detailedmosaic of information \u2013 about a person, for instance \u2013 that is, inprinciple, available publicly.\n28\nYet, if the concerns are visible, the need for domestic informa-\ntion also is plain. The September 11 terrorists not only trained inAfghanistan, they also used European cities such as Hamburg andBrixton as \u201cstaging\u201d areas where they could live, train, and recruit ina protective environment. Similarly, they mixed easily in some areasof the United States, \u201chiding in plain sight\u201d in South Florida and\n248 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nSouthern California and perhaps in Lackawanna. The need for infor-mation extends beyond simply following individuals; it also requiresknowledge of what is being said on the streets and in the mosques ofBrixton or Boston or New Jersey \u2013 that is, it is conducting \u201cforeignintelligence\u201d domestically.\nIn March 2003, for instance, a prominent Yemeni cleric was appre-\nhended in Germany on charges of \ufb01nancing terrorism at a Brooklynmosque used to help funnel millions of dollars to Al Qaeda and,according to federal of\ufb01cials, he boasted that he had personally deliv-ered $20 million to Osama bin Laden. The cleric, Sheik Muham-mad Ali Hassan al-Mouyad, told an FBI informant that he was aspiritual advisor to bin Laden and had worked for years to pro-vide money and weapons for a terrorist jihad.\n29Sheik Mouyad\nboasted that jihad was his \ufb01eld and said he received money for\njihad from collections at the Al Farooq mosque in Brooklyn. As\nNYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, Al Qaeda operatives\u201cdid their fund-raising right here in our own backyard in Brooklyn.\u201dMore recently discovered groups or cells, like the Fort Dix plotters,have been homegrown and thus do not even need to hide in plainsight.\nThe collision of values runs through the war against terrorism. For\ninstance, stories abound of people continually harassed when theytried to \ufb02y because they are on one of the watch lists.\n30At the same\ntime, Congress\u2019s General Accounting Of\ufb01ce criticized the variousagencies for not sharing their watch lists. Nine federal agencies main-tained lists to spot terrorist suspects trying to get a visa, board a plane,cross a border, or engage in similar activities \u2013 the FBI, the then-INS, the DHS, the Pentagon, the State Department, and four otheragencies.\nAll kept such lists and shared information from them with other\nfederal of\ufb01cials, as well as local and state police of\ufb01cials as needed.However, the congressional study found that some agencies did noteven have policies for sharing watch-list information with other agen-cies, and that those that did often required complex, labor-intensivemethods to cull information. Agencies often had different types ofdatabases and software that make sharing information next to impos-sible. As a result, sharing of information was often fractured, \u201cincon-sistent and limited,\u201d the study reported.\n31\nRebuilding the Social Contract 249\nnew circumstances, new requirements\nBeneath the heat of the political controversy surrounding the secondNSA program for wiretapping of U.S. citizens in connection with sus-pected terrorists abroad lay the same issue of where to strike the bal-ance between privacy and security in the context of a changed threatand changing technology. President Bush described the domestic-surveillance program as vital to protecting the United States fromterrorist attacks. \u201cIf Al Qaeda is calling someone in America, wewant to know what they\u2019re saying on that call,\u201d he said.\n32Yet, critics\ncharged that the program violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s separationof powers, its Fourth Amendment protections from illegal search andseizure, as well as circumventing \u2013 thus violating \u2013 the FISA.\nIt is intriguing that in the late 2000s, Sweden grappled with similar\nissues that evoked clear echoes of the arguments heard in the UnitedStates. Sweden\u2019s Defence Radio Establishment (FRA), the nation\u2019sSIGINT service, argued \u2013 much like supporters of the NSA program \u2013that it must have access to major communications lines passingthrough Sweden. It argued that it would \ufb01lter out Swedish calls andfocus on its targets. For its part, the Swedish Security Service opposedthe expansion. Committed to wiretapping only with court involve-ment, the Service argued that the FRA would necessarily interceptSwedish calls \u2013 who knows where \u201cSwedish\u201d calls are routed \u2013 andthat its work would intrude on nonmilitary responsibilities such ascounterterrorism and organized crime.\nThe expanded authority was \ufb01nally approved by the Swedish Par-\nliament in June 2008 after an intense public and parliamentary debatein which a number of lawmakers from the governing coalition threat-ened to vote with the opposition and reject the bill.\n33As a conces-\nsion to the internal and external opposition, the government promisedto tighten the process of authorization and control, and limit thenumber of agencies permitted to make requests for tapping. Oneagency excluded from access was the Security Service, an exclusionthat means the Service will not have access to any communicationsthat do no pass over purely domestic phone lines \u2013 a re\ufb02ection of thepolitical fear of a public outcry againsts \u201cfree-for-all\u201d wiretapping.\nIn the immediate aftermath of September 11, the Bush adminis-\ntration opted in secret not to seek court approval before conducting\n250 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nwiretaps on the communications of terrorism suspects to and from theUnited States. Former Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales arguedthat the president\u2019s authority to spy on U.S. \u201cpersons\u201d communicatingwith suspected terrorists abroad was granted by Congress through theAUMF. Although the authorization did not speci\ufb01cally mention wire-tapping, its powers were very broad and included, administration of\ufb01-cials argued, the powers to secretly gather intelligence on Al Qaedaand associated groups. The administration noti\ufb01ed the so-called Gangof Eight \u2013 the leaders of each of the two parties, and the chairs andranking members of the intelligence committees from each of the twohouses of Congress.\nOnce the program spilled into the public, it was opposed on a num-\nber of grounds. First, not only did it seem to many people a violationof privacy \u2013 although the administration was careful to emphasizethat unless a U.S. citizen was communicating with a suspected ter-rorist overseas, the communication would not be monitored \u2013 it alsoseemed of dubious legality. After all, the AUMF did not explicitlyauthorize \u201cwarrantless\u201d wiretapping on U.S. citizens, and the programviolated the FISA, which was established expressly for the purpose ofthis type of covert surveillance. In its history, the FISA process hasrarely denied the executive branch a wiretapping warrant and evenallows federal agencies to request \u201cafter-the-fact\u201d warrants for up toseventy-two hours.\nHow effective the program has been was also debated, although the\nissue is dif\ufb01cult to settle, given its secrecy. According to press report-ing, most of the tips by the wiretaps led to \u201cdead ends\u201d and swampedthe FBI.\n34Administration of\ufb01cials, however, asserted that the wire-\ntaps saved lives. In January 2006, General Michael V. Hayden, then-principal DDNI and later CIA director, said, \u201cHad this program beenin effect prior to 9/11, it is my professional judgment that we wouldhave detected some of the 9/11 Al Qaeda operatives in the UnitedStates, and we would have identi\ufb01ed them as such.\u201d\n35Vice President\nCheney, in a speech in January 2008, said \u201cthe program has uncov-ered a wealth of information that has foiled attacks against the UnitedStates; information that has saved countless innocent lives.\u201d\n36\nThe Bush administration\u2019s arguments for the program were some-\nthing of a moving target, and it turned out that there had been inter-nal divisions over the program. Attorney General Gonzales suggested\nRebuilding the Social Contract 251\nthat the White House originally considered legislation to legalize itssecret wiretaps but thought it would not pass Congress. He and otherof\ufb01cials later backtracked and said a bill to reform the FISA wasnot sought because the program\u2019s details would be made public, thusendangering its effectiveness. Critics also pointed to earlier contradic-tory statements made by administration of\ufb01cials denying the existenceof the domestic-spying program. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about chasingdown terrorists, we\u2019re talking about getting a court order before we doso,\u201d President Bush said in an April 2004 speech in Buffalo. \u201cNothinghas changed.\u201d\n37\nFinally, most on Capitol Hill outside of the Gang of Eight were\nkept out of the loop on the domestic-spying program. \u201cWhat is uniqueabout this one particular program among all the other sensitive NSAprograms that justi\ufb01es keeping Congress in the dark?,\u201d asked SenatorJay Rockefeller (D-WV), a member of the Gang of Eight as chairmanof the Senate Intelligence Committee. Attorney General Gonzalessaid that notifying all congressional members was unnecessary be-cause of the AUMF granted by Congress after September 11. Thoseinformed who, like Senator Rockefeller, had doubts about the pro-gram were in the uncomfortable dilemma faced by overseers of secretprograms: their choice was stark \u2013 either acquiesce in secret or riskblowing the program in open opposition.\nAdministration of\ufb01cials maintained that the FISA is an outdated\nlaw enforcement mechanism that is too time-consuming and not con-ducive to current intelligence-gathering demands. The concerns cer-tainly are relevant. The FISA presumes that the government knowswho it wants to wiretap, a reasonable assumption for the era of white-collar spies. Now, however, the government may not know whosecommunications it wants to monitor. Rather, it seeks to troll for sus-picious conversations \u2013 for instance, from the Pakistan\u2013Afghanistanborder region. As DNI McConnell stated in a June 2007 interview,\u201cThe threat has increased, the intent is stated, and the way the word-ing in the current law is captured inhibits or prevents us from beingsuccessful.\u201d\n38\nUnder political pressure, Attorney General Gonzales announced\nin January 2007 a plan to end the program, ceding oversight to theFISA. However, questions about the legality of the program lingeredin Congress. In May 2007, congressional hearings revealed that top\n252 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nJustice Department of\ufb01cials, including then\u2013Attorney General JohnAshcroft, had expressed reservations about the program back in 2004,prompting the White House to push the program forward without theJustice Department\u2019s consent.\n39In August 2007, Gonzales resigned,\nat a time of constant congressional questioning over his role in over-seeing domestic surveillance.\nThe Bush administration\u2019s vow to seek FISA approval for domes-\ntic surveillance was short-lived. In July 2007, weeks before Gonza-les stepped down, intelligence of\ufb01cials approached lawmakers seek-ing emergency legislation to broaden their wiretapping authority. Therequest came on the heels of a ruling by the FISC, the court over-seeing the FISA \u2013 a ruling that impacted the government\u2019s abilityto intercept foreign communications passing through telecommuni-cations \u201cswitches\u201d on U.S. soil. According to a report of the SenateIntelligence Committee, the DNI reported that the FISC\u2019s decision\u201cled to degraded capabilities in the face of a heightened terroristthreat environment.\u201d\n40Congress responded, giving the attorney gen-\neral and the DNI stopgap power to approve international surveillance,bypassing the FISA. The legislation also deemed warrants unneces-sary for surveillance of a person \u201creasonably believed\u201d to be locatedoverseas. Yet, Democrats let the measure expire on February 1, 2008.\nThere is merit to the argument that oversight will have to move\nfrom judicial approval before the fact to some form of continuing legalor congressional review as surveillance proceeds. However, by over-reaching and simply bypassing the FISA, rather than working withCongress to try to \ufb01x it in the \ufb01rst years after September 11, the Bushadministration discredited good arguments. In frustration, congres-sional Democrats made an inane argument of their own, refusing togrant immunity from lawsuits to companies that had cooperated withthe warrantless NSA program. That issue was a sideshow because ifpeople opposed the program, the right destination for protest was thegovernment, not the companies. \u201cThe intelligence community doesn\u2019thave the facilities to carry out the kind of international surveillanceneeded to defend this country since 9/11,\u201d Vice President Cheneysaid in the speech quoted previously. \u201cIn some situations there is noalternative to seeking assistance from the private sector.\u201d It certainlywould make no sense to encourage private entities not to cooperatewith the government when the government asked.\nRebuilding the Social Contract 253\nYet, what was and is important is putting the NSA programs in\nsome legal framework, and the FISA provided such a framework.Shunning it was a mistake and a shame because it created a needlessargument over the past when the discussion should be about what oursecurity requires in the future and how that is balanced with civil liber-ties. The Bush administration\u2019s answer \u2013 that the FISA was too cum-bersome \u2013 rings hollow in light of the changes in the FISA to whichCongress agreed after September 11. For instance, Congress loosenedthe standard for FISA wiretaps in terrorism cases, and it extendedfrom one day to three the emergency period during which an admin-istration could start wiretaps before getting retroactive FISA autho-rization. If the NSA had needed still more \ufb02exibility, it is dif\ufb01cult tobelieve that Congress would not have granted it, especially in thosefearful days after September 11.\nIf the threats posed by changing technology mean that adminis-\ntrations have to be given latitude to troll through communications,then the counterpart should be requiring them to come back to theFISA or a similar body to justify continued surveillance. Indeed, pre-cisely because intelligence tools of the war against terrorism cannot beentirely transparent \u2013 lest the nation\u2019s enemies adapt their operationsto circumvent them \u2013 the social contract requires some processes of\nsecret oversight. The public does not need to know the details of whatis being done in its name; it does need to know that a body indepen-dent of an administration knows and approves. What is critical is theprocess before the fact and oversight afterward, if not before. If, in thefamous phrase, the constitution is not a suicide pact, neither is war ablank check.\n41\nIn his con\ufb01rmation hearings, U.S. Supreme Court Judge Samuel\nAlito gave new salience to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jack-son\u2019s distinction of a half-century ago: the president\u2019s power is great-est if his action is consistent with what Congress has done, less ifCongress has been silent, and least if the action is contrary to thewill of Congress.\n42In passing the FISA, Congress could hardly have\nbeen clearer. Not only did it make the FISA \u201cthe exclusive meansby which electronic surveillance ...m a y b e conducted\u201d for national-\nsecurity purposes, it also explicitly rejected proposed language fromthe Ford administration that would have left open the possibility thata president could continue warrantless wiretaps.\n254 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nIn that light, the July 2008 law that resolved the issue falls short of\nwhat the public deserves and thus is unlikely to be the last word onthe subject. Under the law, the NSA would be allowed to seek FISCorders for broad groups of foreign targets. The law created a newseven-day period for directing wiretaps at foreigners without a courtorder in \u201cexigent\u201d circumstances if government of\ufb01cials assert thatimportant national-security information would be lost. The law alsoexpanded the period for emergency wiretaps on Americans without acourt order from three days to seven if the attorney general certi\ufb01esthat there is probable cause to believe the target is linked to terror-ism. The law makes the FISA the \u201cexclusive\u201d means of conductingintelligence eavesdropping.\nBy all accounts, the FISA process is detailed and scrupulous \u2013\nindeed, perhaps too scrupulous in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, thefamous \u201ctwentieth hijacker\u201d of September 11. The FISA requests arealmost never formally rejected, but that is because they are carefullycrafted and sometimes withdrawn during the process. The problem isthat the process is not and probably cannot be transparent. It will alldepend on how broadly groups of targets are de\ufb01ned. The 2008 lawincludes no explicit requirement that the NSA return to the court tojustify continuing surveillance, perhaps on just a subset of the originalgroup, which is sad; rebuilding the social contract requires better.\nlearning the right lessons\nAs the nation restrikes the balance between security and privacy, the\ufb01rst lesson is that the more intrusive surveillance is at home, thenthe more important is process for oversight and accountability. Thesecond lesson is the need to carefully assess any proposed measure.In the fearful days after September 11, the American people andtheir Congress were prepared to accept almost anything that bodedto make them more secure \u2013 and so it would be in the aftermath ofanother major attack. That makes it even more important to assessany proposed measure for indications that it might be pain for nogain. That is, will it cause citizens inconvenience \u2013 if not damage totheir privacy \u2013 for scant or no gain in the war on terrorism?\nMost of the \ufb01nancial-reporting requirements expanded under the\nPatriot Act fall into that category. Before September 11, \ufb01nancial\nRebuilding the Social Contract 255\ninstitutions had been required to submit a Currency TransactionReport (CTR) for any cash transaction more than $10,000 and a SARwhen they \u201chad reason to suspect\u201d that a transaction was \u201cnot thesort in which the particular consumer would be expected to engage.\u201d\n43\nAlready before September 11, there were concerns about the sheervolume of such reports. However, the Patriot Act increased that \ufb02owby expanding the requirements \u2013 from \ufb01nancial institutions to securi-ties brokers and dealers in the case of SARs, and from \ufb01nancial insti-tutions to any business or trade in the case of CTRs.\nThose \ufb01nancial-reporting requirements may have value for other\nthreats, such as drug traf\ufb01cking. However, they are pain for no gainin the war on terrorism because, alas, terrorism is not expensive. Esti-mates for the total cost of the September 11 attacks are in the thou-sands, not millions, of dollars.\nBy the same token, questions have been raised about the value\nof SARs regarding both \ufb01nancial transactions and other individualbehaviors for detecting terrorist activities. In the \ufb01nancial arena,where SARs have been an established part of efforts to counter crim-inal activity, even before September 11 there were concerns that the\u201cvolume of these reports was interfering with effective law enforce-ment.\u201d\n44After September 11, the range of organizations obligated\nto submit such reports was broadened, prompting calls from the pri-vate sector for better guidelines on what constitutes suspicious activ-ity and laments from federal of\ufb01cials that what is reported has littlevalue.\n45An NCTC of\ufb01cial was quoted in the press observing, \u201cIn\nmany instances, the threshold for reporting is low, which makes itextremely dif\ufb01cult to evaluate some of this information.\u201d\n46In January\n2008, the DNI issued standards for SARs.47\nSimilarly, the FBI\u2019s use of National Security Letters (NSLs) after\nthe expansion of authority in the Patriot Act became controversial.From calendar years 2003 through 2005, the FBI issued approxi-mately 44,000 NSLs containing 143,074 requests. In one investigation,it issued nine NSLs requesting information relating to eleven thou-sand telephone numbers.\n48It issued another 49,425 requests in 2006\nfor a total of 192,499 requests during the four-year period from 2003through 2006.\n49It also turned out that procedures for both authoriz-\ning NSLs within the Bureau and recordkeeping about them had beenhaphazard. A report by the Department of Justice\u2019s IG found that the\n256 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nFBI had \u201cused NSLs in violation of applicable NSL statutes, AttorneyGeneral Guidelines, and internal FBI policies\u201d but that no criminallaws had been broken. A year later, a second IG report con\ufb01rmed the\ufb01ndings of the \ufb01rst, and noted what the FBI had done to correct theshortcomings.\nMoreover, if we are honest, many of the airport-safety measures\nare in the pain-for-little-gain category. In any case, it is not obvi-ous that airport security is worth the almost $6 billion the nation isnow spending on it.\n50That amounts to one FBI for airport security;\nif the cost to private citizens of increased inconvenience and delaywere added, the number could amount to two FBIs.\n51Indeed, one\nof the real failures is that while the strategic warning that existed wellbefore September 11 pointed to one fairly inexpensive \ufb01x \u2013 reinforcedairplane cockpit doors \u2013 even that was judged too expensive beforeSeptember 11. To be sure, the intended purpose of many airport-security measures is public con\ufb01dence as much as real security; ulti-mately, however, measures that do not add much to security will notbuild con\ufb01dence either.\nPart of the reason for the striking cleavage between security and\nliberty in the public debate over domestic intelligence is the absence ofany \u201cCompared to what? And for what gain?\u201d questions. It is imper-ative to begin to develop a systematic framework for assessing thevalue of particular intelligence-gathering measures, the civil libertiesinvolved in them, and the costs that arise from the measures. Thatobstinate assessment is all the more necessary the sharper is the clashof values; the assessment will not settle the argument over values butcan at least put it in a clearer focus.\nThe issue of pro\ufb01ling is a good example: on the one hand, it is\noffensive to our values; on the other, it seems common sense. So far \u2013although surely not forever \u2013 the terrorists of most threat to the nationhave come from or had roots in one part of the world. Not giving spe-cial concern to the people (so far, men) who \ufb01t that description seemssimply ignorant. Worse than ignorant, it seems to impose gratuitouscosts on all those light-skinned grandmothers who are searched atairports as potential terrorists. There is a considerable cost, includ-ing in privacy if not liberty, to notpro\ufb01ling. In fact, it turns out that\nmost broad pro\ufb01ling \u2013 singling out Middle Easterners, for instance \u2013 isineffective because it overwhelms the system with false positives. As\nRebuilding the Social Contract 257\na result, airport screening has turned to behavioral pro\ufb01ling, endeav-\noring to screen people on the basis of visible behavior.52\nIt is imperative to be more open about costs and bene\ufb01ts. The\ncivil-liberties costs are usually argued in terms of individual cases,and those are provocative. However, any system will make mistakes,and while it is a shame that those errors will fall disproportion-ately on one set of people, that shame does not eliminate the needto assess carefully the overall costs. The same is true of bene\ufb01ts.As with pro\ufb01ling, more sophisticated watch lists are better than lesssophisticated. Searching every dark-skinned young male airline trav-eler is both offensive and wasteful. Making watch lists more discrimi-nating by noting those who bought one-way tickets, paid in cash, andother relevant indicators can reduce the numbers who are singled out.\nTo be sure, collecting the information to make still more discrimi-\nnating watch lists \u2013 for instance, by identifying people who had beenassociated with one another before but who made entirely separatearrangements to travel on the same \ufb02ight \u2013 can itself invoke privacyconcerns. Yet, if the information is public in any case \u2013 as is true ofmost business and other associations \u2013 the value of permitting watchlists to assemble it probably outweighs the cost.\nIn September 2003, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6\n(HSPD-6) established a Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) to consol-idate the U.S. government\u2019s approach to terrorist screening.\n53It was\nmeant to consolidate more than a dozen previous lists, including theState Department\u2019s TIPOFF database of more than 110,000 knownand suspected terrorists. To this end, TIPOFF, which had been main-tained by the State Department\u2019s INR, and other watch-list functionswere transferred to the newly established TSC and the TTIC (now theNCTC). Originally based largely on TIPOFF, the NCTC maintains aTerrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE), which reportedlycontains more than 325,000 terrorist-related records.\n54\nFor its part, the TSC is an interagency effort administered by\nthe FBI. The NCTC shares international-terrorist identities data,which is TIDE-generated, with the TSC. Combining these data withother government watch lists, the TSC maintains a consolidated Ter-rorist Screening Database (TSDB), which included 238,000 recordsas of January 2005, according to the Justice Department.\n55The\nTSC, in turn, distributes TSDB-generated international-terrorist alert\n258 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nrecords \u2013 along with domestic-terrorist alert records generated by theFBI \u2013 to frontline screening agencies. The TSC, for example, supportsthe terrorist-screening activities of the DHS\u2019s TSA and the Customsand Border Protection (CBP), as well as State\u2019s Bureau of ConsularAffairs.\nCoordination between the Justice Department and the DHS, not\nsurprisingly, proved to be challenging. Also not surprising, misidenti\ufb01-cations, especially false positives, continued to be controversial. More-over, in the aftermath of the August 2006 plot to bomb airliners boundfor the United States from Britain, the DHS sought passenger namerecords (PNRs) before \ufb02ights, rather than 15 minutes after the \ufb02ight\u2019s\ndeparture, as required previously. The United States and the Euro-pean Union negotiated over these issues, reaching a temporary agree-ment in October 2006 and a permanent agreement in June 2007. Inboth negotiations and in separate U.S. legislation, a central issue wasprocedures for redress if travelers felt they had been wrongly includedon a watch list.\nThe TSA \u201cNo Fly\u201d and \u201cAutomatic Selectee\u201d watch lists are a\nmuch smaller subset of the watch lists. As the names imply, the NoFly list means potential passengers departing from U.S. airports arebarred from boarding and passed to law enforcement, while Auto-matic Selectees are selected for secondary security screening beforebeing cleared to board. The No Fly list reportedly contained twentythousand names at the end of 2004. False positives, however, inclu-ded some prominent politicians, such as Senator Edward Kennedy(D-MA).\nThese issues are not precisely about intelligence but they are\nintelligence-driven. Thus, they also raise the question about how intel-ligence relates to new needs and new mechanisms in an age of terror.They also drive home the lesson that if new processes will imposesome pain, their gain needs to be clearly assessed and understood.Another example is the Computer-Assisted Passenger PrescreeningSystem II (CAPPS II). Prompted in part by the 9/11 Commission\u2019srecommendations, the TSA decided to stop developing the system.It was originally designed to use sophisticated algorithms to searchboth government and commercial databases to acquire limited back-ground information on ticket-buyers to authenticate their identityand look for irregularities in behavior patterns that might suggestpotential risks. Critics, however, decried the mask of secrecy under\nRebuilding the Social Contract 259\nwhich CAPPS II was developed and argued that the potential loss ofprivacy would not be counterbalanced by a corresponding increasein security.\n56The pain, they argued, was not worth the gain. How-\never, the successor program, dubbed \u201cSecure Flight,\u201d also was besetby problems and repeatedly delayed.\nA third lesson is that some caution, and some slowness, is not a\nbad policy as the nation rethinks the \u201coppositions\u201d on which ColdWar institutions and processes were based. The values at stake arepowerful and we have yet to calibrate the terrorist threat. Indeed, westill do not understand what happened to the nation on September 11,2001. We are learning, but there are still large unknowns about the ter-rorists\u2019 logistics, their own intelligence, and other concerns. We sensebut do not yet know that terrorism against the homeland will be seri-ous for the United States but not in a class with the threat faced byIsrael. Thus, we suspect but do not yet know that the nation will notbe forced to shift the balance as far toward security as Israel has hadto do.\n57\nBecause of the controversy surrounding them, many (but not all)\nprovisions of the Patriot Act were \u201csunset\u201d powers that expired in2005 if they were not speci\ufb01cally reauthorized in subsequent legisla-tion (which most were). It seems wise to continue sunset measures,especially controversial ones, in the war against terrorism, given thatthe terrorist threat is yet to be calibrated and the costs and bene\ufb01tsof particular measures are yet to be assessed seriously. It seems wisergiven that with the bene\ufb01t of some hindsight, for example, some of the\ufb01rst Patriot Act\u2019s provisions seem only tangentially connected to thewar on terrorism. The need to reauthorize antiterror measures can bean opportunity to rejudge the threat and to sense again how willingthe American people are to take particular pains in confronting it.\nBy the same token, although it makes sense for the nation to think\nseriously about the prospect of creating a domestic-intelligence ser-vice separate from law enforcement, it is probably not yet time \u2013for all the reasons outlined in Chapter 5 \u2013 to actually create sucha service. At the federal level, much is in motion but not much issettled. FBI Director Mueller is determined to turn the mission ofthe Bureau from law enforcement to prevention and intelligence, butdoing so runs against the powerful organizational culture. The DHShas been endowed with an intelligence unit, but it has been slow to\ufb01nd both its footing and its place among the established agencies.\n58\n260 Intelligence for an Age of Terror\nThe DHS was also to have the mission of \u201cconnecting the dots,\u201d butthat mission passed to the NCTC, which seems to serve senior of\ufb01cialswell but \ufb01nds it dif\ufb01cult to move information downward to state andlocal of\ufb01cials and the private sector. What its \u201cstrategic operationalplanning\u201d mission is in the war against terrorism or how effective itcan be at that mission also remain in question.\nPerhaps the slowly turning wheels of bureaucracy can provide time\nfor re\ufb02ection on the threats and values at stake. The \u201coppositions\u201d arenot to be discarded lightly. We do not yet have consensus on where tostrike the balance between security and liberty, so we are still nearthe beginning of rethinking and reshaping as we calibrate the terroristthreat against the homeland. As with \ufb01ghting the Cold War, we prob-ably will come to settled new arrangements for \ufb01ghting terrorism justas the threat moves on to something else!\na \ufb01nal word\nFor guidance about intelligence in a democracy, no one has improvedon Stans\ufb01eld Turner\u2019s advice, which turns The New York Times test\nfor covert action into a more general prescription: \u201cThere is one over-all test of the ethics of human intelligence activities. That is whetherthose approving them feel they could defend their decisions beforethe public if their actions became public.\u201d\n59\nYet, it is dif\ufb01cult for me not to end this book in a wistful tone. One\nof the bene\ufb01ts of comparisons across countries is that is does makeyou clearly see your own arrangements and your own country. In thiscase, the experience has been watching our British colleagues \u2013 from\u201cthe land of of\ufb01cial secrets\u201d \u2013 put in place what seem to me to be sen-sible arrangements for expanded intelligence and its oversight. In thatwork, they take considerable pride and justi\ufb01ably so.\n60For me, their\nexperience harkened back to how we felt after the Church Commit-tee and the FISA and the oversight committees: like we had fashionedsturdy approaches to dif\ufb01cult dilemmas. It has not worked all thatbadly, but it has not worked all that well either \u2013 hence, wistfulness.Mostly, no arrangements in the political arena can fail to be affectedby the increasingly bitter partisanship that has af\ufb02icted the Americansystem during the past generation. The quality of the members of theintelligence oversight committees also has diminished as the work has\nRebuilding the Social Contract 261\ngotten more dif\ufb01cult and less \u201csexy\u201d \u2013 however, that may be mostlyan artifact of the partisanship.\nYet, the larger reason for my wistfulness is that important \ufb01gures\nin American politics do not seem to understand the point that I andmy British colleagues hold central: to do more intelligence, you haveto be more transparent and accountable. It is not just right ethically;it is practically necessary. In the Bush administration, Vice PresidentCheney in particular seemed to believe that either the threat is self-evidently so great that Americans (and their allies) should toleratealmost anything or simply that recent presidents had conceded toomuch power. On that score, no one has improved on Jackson\u2019s argu-ment that presidents are least powerful when they act against theexpressed spirit of Congress. In that sense, the way to maximize pres-idential power is not simply to assert it.\nYet, I confess that I hear the Cheney-esque view from other Amer-\nicans as well. At a luncheon, a member of the Los Angeles CountySheriff\u2019s Advisory Committee on Homeland Security said he regardedthe terrorist threat as a war to the \ufb01nish, one in which no holds werebarred. When I demurred, saying that if in the end this was a \ufb01ghtto the \ufb01nish, it still was a \ufb01ght over ideas, my interlocutor listened tothe point but did not really take it. He did not understand that moreterrorist attacks, even several more on the scale of September 11, willnot destroy America. What might destroy us is our own reaction.\nIn this grander way as well, we determine the threat to ourselves\nin this age of terror. My friend and colleague, Brian Jenkins, stated itplainly:\nThe terrorist threats we confront today will continue for many years. We arestill closer to the beginning than the end of what is likely to be a very longcampaign. . . . America will be judged not just by what we say but by what wedo. We cannot claim to be a nation of laws, a champion of democracy, whenwe too easily accept a disturbing pattern of ignoring inconvenient rules, jus-tifying our actions by extraordinary circumstances, readily resorting to extra-judicial action based upon broad assertions of unlimited executive authority,and espousing public arguments against any constraints on how we treat thosein our custody. The defense of democracy requires the defense of democracy\u2019sideals.\n61\nOr, as I would say it less gracefully: I do not fear the terrorists. I dosometimes fear us.\n\nNotes\nChapter 1: Introduction\n1.The two most detailed in the United States are those of the 9/11 Com-mission and the WMD Commission.

Congress passed this into law, then later\n270 Notes to Pages 86\u201391\napproved giving the DCI two more deputies, for analysis and collection.The Commission report is titled Preparing for the 21st Century: An\nAppraisal of U.S. Intelligence (Washington, DC, 1996), available at\nhttp://www.access.gpo.gov/int/report.html (last visited April 25, 2005).\n13.This transformation is discussed at length in Chapter 4 of Gregory F.

Part of their purpose was procedural: if the top-line bud-get were public, it could be appropriated directly and publicly to the DNI.The DNI would be in visible charge. If, however, the top line remainedsecret \u2013 as it did in the \ufb01nal bill \u2013 then the budget would still have to be\u201claundered\u201d through the Pentagon. Even if the DNIs had full control inprinciple (which the \ufb01nal bill did not give them), their control still mighthave been diluted by the pass-through in the Pentagon.\n18.See http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/2007/10/dni103007.pdf.\n19.President Truman and his con\ufb01dants wanted a more powerful DCI in thelate 1940s but retreated in the face of Pentagon and State Departmentopposition, especially so because the administration\u2019s eyes were \ufb01xed onthe main prize, a more centralized Pentagon.

The correspondence was muchless for agencies such as State\u2019s INR or the NIC, which had relativelyintense, ongoing interactions with actual customers; they both needed andheeded NIPF much less.\n24.See Gregory F.

The Japanese\nconcept of kaizen is directly derived from the principles of designed-in\n(versus \ufb01xed-after-production) quality, customer-centrism, and continu-ous improvement brought to Japan after World War II by Edwards Dem-ing, an American who worked with the Japanese to recover their indus-trial capacity. His work did not get traction in the United States untilkaizen was promoted here in the 1980s as a Japanese management practice\nknown as Total Quality Management. Deming\u2019s approach was to examineand improve the system in which operations take place and not simply\nNotes to Pages 139\u2013147 277\nto reorganize structure or blame the person. A modern incarnation ofthis thinking is in Six Sigma programs to reduce product \ufb02aws as appliedat Motorola and GE. For example, see http://www.deming.org/ regard-ing Deming\u2019s work and some current resources; and http://www.isixsigma.com/me/six\nsigma/ regarding Six Sigma methods. It is also relevant to ser-\nvice and intellectual processes, such as intelligence, in its reliance on threeconcepts: (1) products alone are not as important as the process that cre-ates them; (2) the interdependent nature of systems is more importantthan any one isolated problem, cause, or point solution; and (3) non-judgmental regard for people in that people usually execute as the sys-tem directs or allows, people are not suf\ufb01cient explanation for a prob-lem (or a success), and blaming violates an associated principle againstwaste.\n8.For instance, the Dempster\u2013Shafer theory is a generalization of Baye-sian logic that allows analysts to derive degrees of belief in one ques-tion from probabilities for a related question \u2013 for example, infor-mation provided by an observer or informant whose reliability issubjectively assessed.

To make decisions, analysts and pol-icy makers would look for strategies that seem robust across many\n278 Notes to Pages 147\u2013149\nscenarios. For intelligence analysis, the aim might be to identify outcomesthat seem robust across variables.\n16.This list is adapted from Kamarck, cited previously.\n17.Malcolm Gladwell\u2019s popular account weaves together stories of such tacitknowledge across a range of \ufb01elds. See Blink: The Power of Think-\ning Without Thinking (New York: Little Brown, 2005). See also Gary\nKlein, Intuition at Work: Why Developing Your Gut Instinct Will Make\nY o uB e t t e ra tW h a tY o uD o (New York: Doubleday, 2002). The idea\nof unconscious knowledge in psychological inquiry, however, goes backto the nineteenth century: Helmholz in psychophysiology and visionand Freud in psychology. Current usage derives from Michael Polanyi\u2019s1950s writings on science (see, e.g., http://www.infed.org/thinkers/polanyi.htm). Psychologist Robert Sternberg has popularized three kindsof intelligence: creative or experiential, analytical or componential, andpractical or contextual, the last of which features tacit knowledge. SeeR. J. Sternberg, Beyond IQ: A Triarchic Theory of Human Intelli-\ngence (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985) and http://www.\nyale.edu/rjsternberg/). For an introduction to knowledge managementin business, see Tim Ray and Stephen Little, Managing Knowledge: An\nEssential Reader (London: Sage Publications, 2005).
